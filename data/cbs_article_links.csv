Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim. Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, retired from NASA in 2018 and now works for Axiom.

Now retired from NASA, Whitson is America's most experienced astronaut with three ISS missions and an earlier Axiom commercial flight to her credit. NASA Going into the Ax-4 flight, Whitson had logged 675 days in space across three NASA flights and one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space. As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission ""opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.""

A new study says policies curb litter – by a lot,18,609,15,7,"Plastic bag regulations have led to significant decrease in shoreline litter, study finds 03:37 State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines — potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found. More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes – and if they did, to what extent. Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations. ""When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,"" Oremus said in a statement. ""And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy."" These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments . Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. A plastic bag on the banks of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 2019. Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own. Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed ""single use"" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered ""reusable"" under partial bans, ""there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use."" In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide ""preemption"" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all. During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said. ""Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting—but not eliminating—shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,"" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.

The 32-year-old from Seattle was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, according to a statement from the Bureau of Prisons. Responding employees initiated life-saving measures, and emergency medical services transported Park to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, the bureau said. His cause of death wasn't immediately clear, and the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service have been notified. No employees or other incarcerated individuals were injured, the bureau said. Park, a U.S. citizen, had arrived at the L.A. detention center on June 13, after he was indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property. He was apprehended in Poland earlier this month after flying to Warsaw a few days after the bombing outside American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic on May 17 . He was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate — commonly used as a precursor to construct homemade explosives — to the bomber, who was identified by officials as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus. Bartkus died in the blast outside the fertility clinic. ""Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,"" Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said at a news briefing after the blast. Prosecutors said evidence showed that Park and Bartkus shared nihilist beliefs. The criminal complaint filed against Park alleged the attack ""was motivated by his pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology, which is the belief that individuals should not be born without their consent and that non-existence is best."" The clinic was damaged, but staff said none of the embryos stored there were lost, and the practice reopened in a temporary location. Palm Springs",2025-06-24T17:09:15.322218

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap.""

Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty ""Humanitarian principles must be reinstated,"" Lazzarini said in his statement. ""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget — and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines. During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making. They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls ""one big beautiful bill,"" which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid , a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage. ""If there isn't a funding mechanism in place, if there isn't an act of Congress to replace that revenue stream, hospitals are going to close. People are going to die. ... That's the consequence of your policies,"" Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan of Massachusetts said. The Trump administration has already made cuts to funding for research at the National Institutes of Health and other resource and treatment programs. ""This isn't a budget, it's a death sentence,"" said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, referring to proposed cuts to the HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated . Carter submitted to the record what he described as a ""whole bunch of studies (that) debunk"" many of Kennedy's claims and prove he's not ""being forthright with us or the American people."" Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York allowed Kennedy to respond to what Langworthy described as Carter's ""outlandish claims."" Kennedy said he's committed to doing ""evidence-based, gold-standard science"" to take care of ""the most desperate, most vulnerable Americans, including people of HIV."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the ""broken status quo,"" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is ""never an easy task. Here are some other highlights from the hearing. RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to ""defend the indefensible"" with his actions as secretary. ""There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,"" Pallone said. ""The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions."" Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to ""major decisions about vaccines."" ""Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?"" he said. ""You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this."" Kennedy said the ACIP committee — the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices — was the public process for regulating vaccines. ""You fired the ACIP committee ,"" Pallone said. ""I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,"" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with new picks , including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for ""impugning the reputation of a member of Congress."" Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone. Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's ""defend the spend"" initiative , which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it. ""Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?"" DeGette asked. ""About what?"" Kennedy asked. ""The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?"" she repeated. ""No,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils In defense of his NIH funding cuts , Kennedy said he cut ""thousands of studies"" that were doing ""nothing to improve American health"" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research. ""Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,"" Kennedy said. ""NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are — what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?"" Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts. COVID vaccines and pregnancy Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for childre n and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said ""study after study shows adverse events"" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed ""27 adverse events during pregnancy."" Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however, recently reiterated that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals. ""We're not depriving anybody of choice,"" Kennedy said. ""If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation."" ""Not true,"" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. ""We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true."" House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it ""extremely alarming"" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations ""without consulting the customary panel of experts."" ""You have lied to the American people"" In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of ""lying"" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel. ""But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,"" Schrier said. ""Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?"" Kennedy responded by saying he ""never made that agreement."" ""So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?"" Schrier said. ""If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,"" Kennedy said. ""It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,"" Schrier said. ""I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,"" Kennedy responded. ""Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,"" Schrier said. Republicans praise Kennedy Some Republicans referred to Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" or ""MAHA"" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, ""I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again."" Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his ""commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs."" Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue ""gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures."" Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: ""I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day."" During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it ""crashes through the red tape""; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors ; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August. ""We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,"" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors. United States Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. First Responders look at destruction caused by an Iranian missile strike in Beersheba, southern Israel, June 24, 2025. Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: ""ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.""

Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport. There were no reports of casualties, and no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. War Iran Israel Nuclear Weapons Cease-fire Donald Trump",2025-06-24T17:09:20.296484

One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:09:23.781016

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note.

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

""The gut and brain (connection) is really new burgeoning scientific work that's come out over the last couple of decades — although Hippocrates eons ago spoke about it,"" she says. ""But what we understand is that the gut and brain arise from the exact same cells in the human embryo, so they are connected even from our early development. Then they are connected by the vagus nerve throughout our lives."" The vagus nerve is our 10th cranial nerve, which she describes as a ""text messaging system between the brain and the gut, sending messages all the time — communicating chemical messages."" One of the things that affects these chemical messages? The food we eat.

How to support the gut-brain connection through food One of the best things you can do support your ""food-mood"" connection is to clean up your diet, Naidoo says, starting off with fiber. Naidoo explains fiber is ""extremely important for the gut microbes, because that's what helps them thrive.""

""You can't actually get fiber from animal sources of protein, so lean into those veggies,"" she says, pointing to clean proteins as a good option and healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. If you're plant-based, you can get a short chain omega-3s from chia seeds and flax seeds. The bottom line: Lean into healthy, whole foods.

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here.

""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that ""at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed."" The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases. ""Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,"" the department said in a statement. A statement by Sen.

The U.S. has about 40,000 military personnel, numerous bases and air and naval fleets that it can deploy across the Middle East. Bahrain hosts the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet , whose area of responsibility includes the Persian Gulf, Red Sea, Arabian Sea and parts of the India Ocean. The U.S. Navy has used the base since 1948, when the facility was operated by Britain's Royal Navy. There are some 9,000 U.S. military personnel in Bahrain. Kuwait has several U.S. military installations: Camp Arifjan Base, Ali Al Salem Air Base and Camp Buehring. Camp Arifjan is the forward headquarters of U.S. Army Central. Ali Al Salem, known as ""The Rock"" for its isolated, rugged environment, is roughly 25 miles (40 kilometers) from the Iraqi border. Camp Buehring was established in 2002, in the run-up to the Iraq War and is a staging post of U.S. Army units deploying into Iraq and Syria, according to the U.S. Army website.

The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that ""at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed."" The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases. ""Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,"" the department said in a statement. A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims ""not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.""

Determining the intensity of your workouts is a good way to make sure you're getting the level of activity you're aiming for. How can you calculate it? It's all about hitting different heart rates, or the the number of times your heart beats per minute. If you're focusing on moderate exercise, experts say you should be getting to 50% to 70% of your maximum heart rate. Intense or strenuous exercise is about 70% to 85% of your maximum heart rate. For example, a 30-year-old's estimated maximum heart rate is 190, meaning hitting a heart rate of about 95 to 133 would be considered moderate exercise while a range of 133 to 161.5 would be strenuous. Staying in your designated range will help you ""get the most out of your activities,"" the American Cancer Society, which offers an online calculator, notes on its website . Incorporating the range into practice could also help in weight loss . At least 2.5 hours of moderate to higher intensity aerobic exercise per week ""may help lead to a meaningful decrease"" in weight, waist size and body fat, according to a review, published recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association , of more than 100 clinical trials.

Of course, weight loss isn't all about exercise — nutrition also plays a big role. ""We always recommend starting with diet and exercise.

Arsia Mons, which dwarfs Earth's tallest volcanoes, and its two neighboring volcanoes are often surrounded by water ice clouds, especially in the early morning. The image released Friday marks the first time one of the volcanoes has been imaged on the planet's horizon, NASA said. Odyssey has previously captured high-altitude images of the Martian horizon , and to do so, it rotates 90 degrees while in orbit so that its camera can take the picture, NASA said. The spacecraft typically focuses on the upper atmosphere but also studies surface features. The latest image, captured on May 2, focuses on Arsia Mons, which is roughly twice as tall as Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa, which rises 6 miles above the seafloor. The 2001 Odyssey spacecraft captured a first-of-its-kind look at Arsia Mons, which dwarfs Earth's tallest volcanoes. NASA Arsia Mons is the cloudiest of the three volcanoes in the area -- collectively called the Tharsis Mountains -- and the clouds are especially thick when the Red Planet is farthest from the sun, a period called aphelion. The new snapshot clearly shows the cloud canopy across the Red Planet's equator. ""We picked Arsia Mons hoping we would see the summit poke above the early morning clouds. And it didn't disappoint,"" said Jonathon Hill, the operations lead for Odyssey's camera, called the Thermal Emission Imaging System, or THEMIS. The angle of the camera allows scientists to see dust and water ice cloud layers, enabling them to observe changes over the course of seasons. ""We're seeing some really significant seasonal differences in these horizon images,"" said planetary scientist Michael D. Smith of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. ""It's giving us new clues to how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time."" Launched in 2001, Odyssey has the distinction of being the longest-running spacecraft orbiting another planet. NASA's Perseverance rover, which landed on Mars in 2021 , is collecting samples for an eventual return to Earth from Jezero Crater, an ancient lakebed and river delta that could hold clues to any past microbial life.

These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's ""The White Lotus."" Saxon is a chiseled car crash – a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that? Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: ""The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way."" Did he have any reservations? ""Yes, I was worried,"" he said. ""I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character."" And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. ""When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'"" Schwarzenegger recalled. ""So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go."" To watch a trailer for Season 3 of ""The White Lotus,"" click on the video player below: The White Lotus Season 3 | Official Trailer | Max by Max on YouTube The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world – a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, ""There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'"" The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. ""It was me, Abby, my fiancée, and my mom,"" he said. ""We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'"" His fiancée is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying. Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. ""It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!"" Patrick laughed. His best friends are his family. They're also his greatest fans. When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from ""The White Lotus,"" as a standout among standouts – the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism. In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's ""Actors on Actors,"" Arnold Schwarzenegger said, ""To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus."" Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: ""There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?"" ""Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,"" Arnold said. ""My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree."" Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. ""I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that."" He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money – how to run a business, how to create a brand. ""My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,"" said Patrick. ""And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell."" He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all – and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics. Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, ""I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back."" Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, ""The Staircase."" That, he said, ""was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?""

That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. ""I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,"" he said. ""I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.""

The Doors soon got their break, in May of '66, at London Fog, a tiny nightclub on the Sunset Strip. It's now a barber shop. ""Oh, I need a haircut,"" laughed Densmore on a recent return visit. The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members. The Doors (from left, Jim Morrison, Ray Manzarek, Robbie Krieger and John Densmore) pose for a portrait in Los Angeles, c. 1966. The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was ""the biggest deal in town."" ""It was Mecca,"" Densmore added. The room isn't much different from what it was back then. ""The stage is lower,"" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. ""And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!"" he laughed. He described the improvisational attitude of the band: ""Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide … Break on through.'"" Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: ""He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'"" I asked, ""Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?"" ""It was the words,"" Krieger said. ""They were so different than anything that was out there."" ""Gifted,"" said Densmore. ""'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide… ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!"" Correspondent Anthony Mason with John Densmore and Robby Krieger, back on stage at the Whisky a Go Go, where The Doors played in 1966.

Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'"" ""Light My Fire,"" written by Krieger, went to #1. The Doors - Light My Fire (Single Mix) [Official Audio] by The Doors on YouTube But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, ""At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'"" ""You knew that right away?"" I asked. ""Kinda sensed it."" ""Was that hard to accept?"" ""Yeah,"" Densmore said. ""I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction."" After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. ""At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,"" Densmore said. Krieger said, ""He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead."" Why? ""He loved the mythology,"" Densmore replied. ""He lived for The Doors,"" said Krieger. ""I mean, that was his whole life, you know? And he didn't want it to be over."" ‎Genesis Publications Manzarek died in 2013.

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire . The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs . The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said last week Iran was ""very close to having"" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran ""is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly."" The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but ""pressure has probably built on him to do so"" — noting an ""erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public."" Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes. Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was ""wrong"" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, ""I think they were very close to having one."" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was ""taking my testimony out of context."" The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time. Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes. ""They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,"" Rubio said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."" ""[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,"" she added. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, ""The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making — especially for military combat operations and deployment."" ""The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions —which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,"" Parnell said.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-iran-strikes-set-back-nuclear-program-by-months-intel-assessment/,Politics,2025-06-24T20:07:47-0400,"Trump's strikes on Iran set back nuclear program by months, initial intel assessment finds",14,904,25,6,"U.S. strikes only set back Iran nuclear program by months, sources say 04:33 An initial classified assessment found the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents. The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/retirement-savings-how-much-do-you-need-magic-number/,MoneyWatch,2025-04-18T16:49:36-0400,How much money do you need to retire? Here's what Americans say is their magic number.,16,741,24,7,"More Americans hitting retirement age, but fewer feel financially ready 03:53 Whether you're fast approaching retirement or have decades to prepare, the question of how much to save can be daunting. Yet Americans have a goal in mind for what's needed to finance a comfortable retirement: $1.26 million. That's according to a new study by Northwestern Mutual, which surveyed more than 4,500 U.S. adults aged 18 and older. While $1.26 million may seem unattainable to many, it represents a scaled-down ambition from last year's survey, when workers pegged their ideal retirement needs at $1.46 million. The reason for the scaled-down financial goal comes down to cooling inflation, which has tempered workers' expectations for their retirement needs, researchers at Northwestern Mutual said. Since touching a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022, inflation has gradually eased, dropping last month to 2.4% on an annual basis . ""The inflation rate has been falling, and we're starting to see people's expectations for retirement savings soften, too,"" said Melinda Wilke, a wealth management advisor at Northwestern Mutual. But that's not to say inflation has disappeared from the equation altogether. ""Obviously a reduced inflation rate is good news,"" said David John, a senior policy advisor at AARP. ""But we are still seeing many people who are very concerned that prices are going to continue to go up, and what that means for how long their retirement savings will last."" John added that concern about the fate of the Social Security program — which currently provides monthly payments to more than 70 million Americans — is top of mind for many Americans the nonprofit works with. Even after years of saving, a majority say they're worried they could still come up short in retirement. Fifty–one percent of those surveyed said they think it's somewhat or very likely that they could run out of retirement savings. Despite having lofty goals for their retirement nest eggs, many workers are falling short. According to the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances , the most recent data available, Americans had median retirement savings of $87,000. Generational Differences Americans also express generational differences when it comes to retirement — and the nation's youngest adults have the biggest aspirations, the study found. About 63% of Gen Z — whose oldest members are now in their early to mid-20s — say they believe they will be financially prepared for retirement. That's far higher than the millennial or baby boomer generation, with their confidence at 54% and 56%, respectively. Part of this, Wilke said, is due to an interest in wealth building among Gen Z. ""FinTok, meme stocks and cryptocurrency piqued their interest,"" the wealth management advisor said. Gen Z also started their retirement planning earlier than other generations, with members of the group starting to save at the average age of 24, with the goal of leaving the workforce at 61. In contrast, older generations started saving much later, with boomers beginning at an average age of 37 and with plans to retire at 72. The least confident generation is Gen X, or workers between about 45 to 60 years old, with only 46% saying they believe they'll hit retirement in good financial shape, the survey found. Gen X could be described as ""Generation AnXiety,"" Wilke added. As the first generation of U.S. workers to lean on 401(k) plans as a primary means of saving, they're generally more underprepared for retirement than other generations, with about half telling Natixis last year that they'd need a miracle to retire. Retirement savings can vary, depending on age — NerdWallet offers a handy breakdown — but overall, about one in four Americans with retirement savings say they've put aside one year or less of their current annual income, the Northwestern Mutual survey found. How much to save for retirement? Building a $1.26 million retirement fund is easier if you start young. Workers who begin to save at age 20 would need to sock away $330 per month to reach $1.26 million, while people starting at age 30 would need to save $695 per month, according to Northwestern Mutual. Still, saving will look different for everyone, experts say. John from AARP outlined a few considerations for people to keep in mind as they map out their retirement plan, including: Start saving if you haven't already. ""Any level of savings is better than having no savings at all,"" John said. Wait to retire as long as you can to get the maximum monthly payment from Social Security. People born after 1960 get their full benefits at age 67, but they get even higher payments if they delay claiming until they hit 70, according to SSA . This is also a way to insulate yourself a bit from inflation's impact, John said, since Social Security payments are inflation-protected year to year. Take full advantage of your employer's match program if you have one. ""It's free money, essentially getting your savings to grow rather quickly,"" said John. Avoid reacting to market volatility by suddenly moving your investments into something safer. It may be tempting with today's stock market turbulence , but John said it's best to wait given what you had will likely grow back over time.

Alessandro Coatti , 42, worked for Britain's Royal Society of Biology as a science policy officer whose job included giving evidence to parliament, before leaving that post in 2024 to travel in South America. Part of his body was found in a suitcase on a riverbank on April 6. Other remains were later found in other locations. Coatti had arrived in Santa Marta, a city that acts as a gateway to idyllic palm-lined Caribbean beaches and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountain range, as a tourist. The police said he was lured by a gang that planned to rob him to an abandoned house in the city, through a dating app for the LGBTQ community. Scientist Alessandro Coatti was reported missing in Santa Marta, Colombia, on April 5, 2025. Royal Society of Biology El Tiempo quoted a local hotel worker as saying Coatti was conducting research on local animal species and had asked about visiting the village of Minca, about six miles southeast of Santa Marta. Santa Marta's Mayor Carlos Pinedo said Sunday that four people suspected of his murder and dismemberment had been arrested in raids in the Colombian capital Bogota, the second city of Medellin as well as in Santa Marta and the town of Arjona, near the port city of Cartagena. At a press conference on Monday , Santa Marta police chief Colonel Jaime Rios said that the police had received a tip-off, which led them to a house where traces of blood were found. ""Through arduous investigative work, interviews were conducted, biological traces belonging to the victim were collected, and security camera footage was analyzed, which were all key to solving the case,"" he said. The gruesome killing of Coatti, described by colleagues at the Royal Society of Biology as a respected scientist, caused shock in Colombia. ""He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organizing events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,"" the RSB said in a statement after Coatti's death. ""Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with, and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him."" Pinedo had offered a reward of $12,000 for information leading to the capture of his killers. Rios said the reward had led to the breakthrough in the investigation. The Sierra Nevada mountains are home to a drug-running paramilitary gang known as the ""Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada."" It is not known if they had any hand in Coatti's murder, but they have been linked to the murder and dismemberment of others in recent years. Colombia Italy Murder",2025-06-24T17:10:03.491813

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here.

""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

Eight children have come down with severe food poisoning since June 12 after consuming meat products from the two businesses in the northern city of Saint-Quentin. Five of them contracted a rare foodborne illness called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including a 12-year-old girl who died. HUS in most cases occurs after someone ingests E.coli , commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is ""impossible at this stage to confirm that the consumption of products from these two establishments is the source of the contamination,"" local authorities said.

Humans are far from being the only member of the animal kingdom that has mastered using tools. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish for termites, crows create hooked twigs to catch grubs and elephants swat flies with branches. Tool use in the world's difficult-to-study oceans is rarer, however sea otters are known to smash open shellfish with rocks, while octopuses can make mobile homes out of coconut shells. A study published in the journal Current Biology describes a new example of tool use by a critically endangered population of orcas. Scientists have been monitoring the southern resident killer whales in the Salish Sea, between the Canadian province of British Columbia and Washington state, for more than 50 years. Rachel John, a master's student at Exeter University in the U.K., told a press conference that she first noticed ""something kind of weird"" going on while watching drone camera footage last year. The researchers went back over old footage and were surprised to find this behavior is quite common, documenting 30 examples over eight days. One whale would use its teeth to break off a piece of bull kelp, which is strong but flexible like a garden hose. It would then put the kelp between its body and the body of another whale, and they would rub it between them for several minutes. The pair forms an ""S"" shape to keep the seaweed positioned between their bodies as they roll around. ""Skin maintenance behaviors"" Whales are already known to frolic through seaweed in a practice called ""kelping."" They are thought to do this partly for fun, partly to use the seaweed to scrub their bodies to remove dead skin. The international team of researchers called the new behavior ""allokelping,"" which means kelping with another whale. ""We hypothesize that allokelping is similar to skin maintenance behaviors exhibited by other cetaceans,"" the researchers wrote. They found that killer whales with more dead skin were more likely to engage in the activity, cautioning that it was a small sample size. Whales also tended to pair up with family members or others of a similar age, suggesting the activity has a social element. The scientists said it was the first known example of a marine mammal manufacturing a tool. Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University not involved in the study, praised the research but said it ""went a bit too far"" in some of its claims. And it could be argued that other whales known to use nets of bubbles or plumes of mud to hunt represent tool use benefitting multiple individuals, another first claimed in the paper, Mann said. However, the study's authors say allokelping may be the ""first case of non-human animals manipulating a tool with the core of their body rather than an appendage."" Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study's lead author, said it appeared to be just the latest example of socially learned behavior among animals that could be considered ""culture."" But the number of southern resident killer whales has dwindled to just 73, meaning we could soon lose this unique cultural tradition, he warned. ""If they disappear, we're never getting any of that back,"" he said. The whales mainly eat Chinook salmon, whose numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and other forms of human interference. The orcas and salmon are not alone — undersea kelp forests have also been devastated as ocean temperatures rise. Unless something changes, the outlook for southern resident killer whales is ""very bleak,"" Weiss warned. Earlier this year, an unusual spectacle featuring a pod of orcas was also caught on video when onlookers in Seattle were treated to the rare sight of the apex predators hunting a bird close to shore. Killer whales have made headlines for other reasons in recent years. Boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.

The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed ""Gwada negative,"" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery. ""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said. The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman ""is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,"" he said, adding: ""She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself."" The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene. The name ""Gwada negative"", which refers to the patient's origins and ""sounds good in all languages"", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard.

She posted a $1,500 personal recognizance bond on May 17, the same day she was taken into custody, according to the West Virginia Magistrate Court in the county where it happened. Considered a gymnastics legend, Retton became the first American woman to win a gold medal in her sport's individual all-around competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Along with her historic win, Retton also earned two silver and two bronze medals at the Olympics that year, making her the most decorated athlete at the Games and catapulting her to global fame. Gymnast Mary Lou Retton competes at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California. Retton retired from competitive gymnastics two years after the 1984 Olympics, and since then has been a spokesperson for multiple brands, done motivational speaking and raised her children. She faced a public health scare in 2023, when her daughter shared that she had been hospitalized and was ""fighting for her life"" in an intensive care unit while battling a rare form of pneumonia. At the time, Retton's daughter, McKenna Kelley, said her mother was uninsured and asked for donations to support her medical treatment. Retton did ultimately recover from that illness.

Here's what to know.,14,293,17,4,"First-ever Starbucks Global Barista champion crowned 00:49 Starbucks said Tuesday that the coffee chain is changing how it charges for beverage add-ins like matcha and syrups as it moves to standardize pricing across the company's stores. Starbucks will now charge 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce that modifies an unflavored drink, instead of charging for each addition. But the company noted that it won't charge customers to substitute a sauce or syrup in a pre-flavored drink, such as adding vanilla syrup to a Caffè Mocha. Starbucks also plans to charge $1 for adding a scoop of matcha powder to non-matcha drinks, and will charge 50 cents to include dried fruit in a beverage. The changes were reported earlier by Bloomberg News. The change is the latest under CEO Brian Niccol, who wants to overhaul the coffee giant's image as it looks to drive growth. As part of that effort, Niccol wants to improve customer service and ensure that Starbucks cafes are "" inviting places to linger ,"" among other goals and initiatives. The company on Tuesday also said it's conducting a limited customer test of a new feature in the Starbucks app to show pricing updates in real time when a consumer is ordering food or drinks. The goal is to provide better pricing transparency when people place an order, a Starbucks spokesperson said. Starbucks said customers can add its classic syrup, a liquid sugar akin to simple syrup, to any drink at no cost. Starbucks",2025-06-24T17:10:16.671981

Eight children have come down with severe food poisoning since June 12 after consuming meat products from the two businesses in the northern city of Saint-Quentin. Five of them contracted a rare foodborne illness called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including a 12-year-old girl who died. HUS in most cases occurs after someone ingests E.coli , commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is ""impossible at this stage to confirm that the consumption of products from these two establishments is the source of the contamination,"" local authorities said. But the children all consumed meat or meat products from these two butchers a few days before symptoms appeared, it said. Authorities have closed the two shops as a precautionary measure while samples from both stores are tested. The authorities said they should have the results ""early next week"" and an investigation has been launched into where the meat came from. HUS affects between 100 and 165 children in France each year, according to the country's public health agency. E. coli outbreaks have also made headlines recently in the U.S. Earlier this month, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that ground beef that was distributed nationwide may be contaminated with E. coli. In November, a carrot recall was issued by California grower Grimmway Farms after nearly 40 cases were recorded in 18 states. At least 15 people were hospitalized and one person died, the CDC said .

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap.""

""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire . The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs . The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said last week Iran was ""very close to having"" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran ""is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly."" The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but ""pressure has probably built on him to do so"" — noting an ""erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public."" Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes. Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was ""wrong"" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, ""I think they were very close to having one."" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was ""taking my testimony out of context."" The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time. Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes. ""They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,"" Rubio said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."" ""[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,"" she added. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, ""The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making — especially for military combat operations and deployment."" ""The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions —which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,"" Parnell said.

In the video shared on social media, a woman banging on a door and screaming for help can be heard in the background. ""They shot me, they shot me,"" Sarmiento says, as blood is visible on the floor.

In his TikTok posts, Sarmiento spoke about the leader of the Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero, who is one of the country's most wanted criminals known by the alias ""Nino Guerrero."" The U.S. State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Venezuelan government has maintained that the Tren de Aragua — which the U.S. considers a ""terrorist"" organization — has already been dismantled and denies its existence. Sarmiento shared photos and videos of alleged members of the gang and denounced the ""extortion"" by police officers. ""I was kidnapped by... DAET — the police's Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions,"" he stated in one of his final videos. ""We are overrun with delinquent officials who work with common criminals,"" he added. Sarmiento's murder marks the latest in a string of deadly attacks on popular social media figures.

And last month, the murder of a young influencer during a livestream in Jalisco, in western Mexico, shocked the country.

Spaun wins U.S. open after weathering messy rain delay at Oakmont,12,958,10,6,"J.J. Spaun turned a sloppy mess of a U.S. Open at wet and nasty Oakmont into a thing of beauty at the end Sunday with two stunning shots that carried him to his first major championship. First came his driver on the 314-yard 17th hole onto the green for a birdie that gave him the lead. Needing two putts from 65 feet on the 18th to win, he finished his storybook Open by holing the longest putt all week at Oakmont for birdie and a 2-over 72. That made him the only player to finish under par at 1-under 279. It gave him a two-shot victory over Robert MacIntyre of Scotland. And it made Spaun, the 36-year-old Californian who resembles the late Pittsburgh Steelers great Franco Harris, a major champion in only his second U.S. Open. ""I never thought I would be here holding this trophy,"" said Spaun, who finished last year at No. 119 in the world with only one PGA Tour title in his career. ""I always had aspirations and dreams. I never knew what my ceiling was. I'm just trying to be the best golfer I can be."" It was calamity for so many others. J.J. Spaun celebrates with the trophy after winning the U.S. Open golf tournament at Oakmont Country Club Sunday, June 15, 2025, in Oakmont, Pa. Seth Wenig / AP Sam Burns had a two-shot lead going to the 11th tee, made a double bogey from a divot in the first cut and from a lie in the fairway so wet he thought he deserved relief. He shot 78. Adam Scott, trying to become the first player to go more than 11 years between major titles, was tied for the lead with five holes to play. One of the best drivers could no longer find the fairway. He played them in 5 over and shot 79. ""I missed the fairway. I hadn't done that all week really. Then I did, and I paid the price and lost a lot of shots out there,"" Scott said. Carlos Ortiz and Tyrrell Hatton also slashed away in slushy lies, all making mistakes that cost them a chance to survive this beast of day. The rain that put Oakmont on the edge of being unplayable might have saved Spaun. One shot behind at the start of the day, he opened with five bogeys in six holes with some horrific breaks, none worse than hitting the pin on the second hole and seeing it spin back to the fairway. And then came a rain delay of 1 hour, 37 minutes. ""The weather delay changed the whole vibe of the day,"" Spaun said. Remarkably, he made only one bogey the rest of the way. But oh, that finish. MacIntyre, the 28-year-old from Oban toughened by the Scottish game of Shinty, became the new target. He also struggled at the start and fell nine shots behind at one point. But he birdied the 17th and split the fairway on the 18th for a key par, a 68 and the clubhouse lead. Three groups later, Spaun delivered what looked like the winner, a powerful fade that rolled onto the green like a putt and settled 18 feet behind the cup. And then the final putt — no one made a longer one all week. He was helped by Viktor Hovland being on the same line and going first. Spaun rapped it through the soaked turf, walked to the left to watch it break right toward the hole and watched it drop as thousands of rain-soaked spectators erupted. He raised both arms and tossed his putter, jumping into the arms of caddie Mark Carens. The celebration carried into those who lost the battle. MacIntyre, so close to becoming Scotland's first major champion since Paul Lawrie in 1999, sat in scoring in front of a TV and applauded. Hatton was talking with reporters, bemoaning a bad break on the 17th ended his chances of winning. He watched the Spaun's putt and it brightened his mood. ""Unbelievable. What a putt to win. That's incredible,"" he said. ""I'm sad about how I finished, but I'm very happy for J.J. To win a major in that fashion is amazing."" Hovland, who shot 73 to finish third, saw it all — the putt at the end, the bogeys at the start. ""After his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately,"" Hovland said. ""Everyone came back to the pack. I wasn't expecting that really. I thought I had to shoot maybe 3-under par today to have a good chance, but obviously the conditions got really, really tough, and this golf course is just a beast."" Hatton (72) and Ortiz (73), both part of LIV Golf and in serious contention at a major for the first time, tied for fourth along with Cameron Young (70). The consolation for Ortiz was getting into the Masters next year. Scottie Scheffler, 10 shots behind early in the final round, was somehow still part of the conversation on the back nine. But he missed far too many birdie chances even three-putting from 12 feet on the 11th hole. The world's No. 1 player finished with a 70 to tie for seventh with Jon Rahm (67) and Burns, his best friend who will feel the sting. He had a double bogey by missing the green into a bad lie on the slope of a bunker. He missed a pair of 6-foot birdie putts to seize control. And when he made a mess of the 15th for another double bogey. Through it all, Spaun emerged as a U.S. Open champion hardly anyone saw coming — not at the start of the year, not at the start of the round.

A dermatologist explains the skin care trend and its benefits.,15,517,14,3,"What to know about the red light therapy trend 03:50 Red light therapy , also known as LED therapy, is gaining popularity in the skin care world for its potential anti-aging benefits. Dr. Rachel Nazarian, a board-certified dermatologist in New York, told ""CBS Mornings Plus"" that LED, or light emitting diodes, create a narrow wavelength that can ""penetrate the deepest into the tissue, which is probably why it has all this potential to help skin."" This form of light therapy is popping up on social media, with users demonstrating hand-held devices as well as full facial masks they're incorporating into their self-care routines. Here's what else to know about the treatment option. Potential benefits of red light therapy ""There is no doubt that red light can be very, very beneficial to skin,"" Nazarian said. She said there are ""a lot of studies on red light"" but that additional, more standardized studies are still needed. ""What it's actually doing is stimulating the cells to create new energy. And what does our body do with energy? It cleans. So it gives you more collagen, decreases the depth of your wrinkles, can decrease the size of your pores,"" she said. But she says red light therapy won't replace everything in a dermatologist's anti-aging skin care arsenal. ""This is not going to mean you don't do your Botox Cosmetic, your fillers, your lasers — that's separate, those are done in the doctor's office, but these red lights are really fantastic because you have the power to do them at home and safely for most people,"" she said. Red light devices and risks to look for Nazarian admits it can be hard to know the exact efficacy of these devices, since they're not very standardized and may vary in their strength, number of light bulbs and proximity to skin. ""It helps to look for something that says 'FDA cleared,' and that sits in the low energy red light spectrum,"" she said, suggesting that many users may want to avoid devices with infrared. ""Infrared is something you'll see combined with red light a lot these days. Infrared can give off heat. Heat is not good for all skin types. So that's something people might want to steer away from."" The risk with infrared includes skin redness, burning and swelling, which can happen with higher energy types, Nazarian said. And while these therapies don't use UV light, which can damage your skin and eyes, it's best to reduce eye exposure to the bright lights. ""Bright lights are not great for eyes,"" she said. ""So look for the masks that have the little cutouts around your eyes or the ones that come with eyewear."" Generally, however, she considers these therapies safe. ""Unless you have a very specific and rare eye condition, these lights are generally safe at low energy levels for everyone of all skin types,"" Nazarian said.",2025-06-24T17:10:26.617990

Robert Garcia elected ranking member on powerful House Oversight Committee after Rep. Connolly's death,15,560,16,3,"Washington — House Democrats on Tuesday elected Rep. Robert Garcia of California as the new ranking member of the House Oversight Committee following the death of Rep. Gerry Connolly last month. ""I am incredibly honored to have been obviously elected the ranking member for the Oversight Committee,"" Garcia told reporters after the vote, saying the panel would get ""immediately to work,"" while citing an opportunity to ""continue holding the corruption of Donald Trump accountable and also doing incredible work on government reform."" Though Democrats are currently in the minority, as the new ranking member, Garcia would be in line to chair the Oversight Committee if Democrats retake the House in 2026, halfway through President Trump's second term. During Mr. Trump's first term, the committee led numerous investigations into the Trump administration after Democrats won the House in 2018. Connolly's death came weeks after the Virginia Democrat announced that he would not seek reelection in 2026 and would be stepping back from his post as the top Democrat on the committee because his cancer had returned. He was 75 years old. Connolly had been elected to the top committee post months earlier, as the committee's members rejected a push by some to tap a younger generation of lawmakers to lead the party on top panels. Connolly defeated 35-year-old Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to become the ranking member of the powerful committee. Oversight Committee Democrats vied for the ranking member post after Connolly announced his departure from the role. And though Ocasio-Cortez opted not to seek the post, having left the committee months earlier, the contest quickly became crowded. Rep. Robert Garcia speaks during the House Oversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on Delivering on Government Efficiency in the Rayburn House Office Building on February 12, 2025, in Washington, D.C. Garcia, a 47-year-old who currently serves as Democratic Caucus Leadership Representative, initially faced off against three other Democrats — Reps. Stephen Lynch of of Massachusetts, Kweisi Mfume of Maryland and Jasmine Crockett of Texas — for the post. Lynch, 70, served as the acting ranking member, while Mfume, 76, is high in the committee's ranks. And Crockett, 44, is seen as a rising star in the caucus, known for viral moments on the committee. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters after the vote that ""all four candidates were excellent,"" saying that while all of them could have done a ""great job internally,"" the question revolved around who could most successfully share the caucus' message. ""It came down to two candidates, both excellent,"" Pelosi added. In a caucus vote Tuesday, Garcia defeated Lynch for the top post in a 150-63 vote. The selection of a new top Democrat on the committee comes after a shakeup in committee leadership assignments in the party at the beginning of this Congress illustrated tensions over a potential generational shift. Long-serving top Democrats on the Judiciary, Agriculture and Natural Resources Committees stepped away from the top spots amid challenges from younger Democrats as the party prepared to counter Republican efforts with a GOP trifecta in Washington. Garcia said he brings experience to the role, while also acknowledging the party's interest in ""expanding the tent"" and bringing in ""newer voices to the leadership and to this committee.""

Here's what to know.,14,293,17,4,"First-ever Starbucks Global Barista champion crowned 00:49 Starbucks said Tuesday that the coffee chain is changing how it charges for beverage add-ins like matcha and syrups as it moves to standardize pricing across the company's stores. Starbucks will now charge 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce that modifies an unflavored drink, instead of charging for each addition. But the company noted that it won't charge customers to substitute a sauce or syrup in a pre-flavored drink, such as adding vanilla syrup to a Caffè Mocha. Starbucks also plans to charge $1 for adding a scoop of matcha powder to non-matcha drinks, and will charge 50 cents to include dried fruit in a beverage. The changes were reported earlier by Bloomberg News. The change is the latest under CEO Brian Niccol, who wants to overhaul the coffee giant's image as it looks to drive growth. As part of that effort, Niccol wants to improve customer service and ensure that Starbucks cafes are "" inviting places to linger ,"" among other goals and initiatives. The company on Tuesday also said it's conducting a limited customer test of a new feature in the Starbucks app to show pricing updates in real time when a consumer is ordering food or drinks. The goal is to provide better pricing transparency when people place an order, a Starbucks spokesperson said. Starbucks said customers can add its classic syrup, a liquid sugar akin to simple syrup, to any drink at no cost. Starbucks",2025-06-24T17:10:29.886026

Since then, more than 7,200 new zero-emissions vehicles have been distributed to the Postal Service. But a provision tucked inside the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would force the USPS to sell off the brand new trucks and cancel or significantly amend the contract for the remaining 58,800 that are due to be delivered over the next 10 years. FILE - The U.S. Postal Service's next-generation delivery vehicle, left, is displayed as one new battery electric delivery trucks leaves the Kokomo Sorting and Delivery Center in Kokomo, Ind., Thursday, Aug. 29, 2024. Michael Conroy / AP According to the text of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs portion of the bill released by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, chair of the committee, all electric vehicles and related infrastructure owned by the Postal Service will be sold and the proceeds will ""be deposited into the general fund of the treasury."" Selling the EVs would ""cut unnecessary costs and focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental initiatives pushed by the Biden Administration,"" according to the bill. Paul's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Peter Pastre, the vice president of government relations and public policy for USPS, wrote a letter to the Senate in June that said the provision to sell the EVs would ""make major and damaging changes to the U.S. Postal Service's vehicle fleet program, potentially impacting our ability to deliver to millions of Americans."" The bill is being considered under budget reconciliation rules, which means that Republicans can pass it with a simple majority, instead of meeting the 60-vote threshold that is required to consider most Senate legislation. In order to use this approach, every item in the bill must have a budgetary impact, and the Senate parliamentarian determines whether each provision meets that standard, known as the Byrd Rule. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule, according to Senate Democrats . Republicans, who would like to revoke the EVs and their related infrastructure, say this provision could potentially raise money by rescinding $1 billion allocated in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act to purchase the vehicles. But according to Pastre, it would cost more than $450 million to replace the 7,200 revoked vehicles, and the USPS has already spent more than $540 million on electrical upgrades for infrastructure to support the cars. Because the majority of the vehicles are specially designed for the Postal Service — like right-side driving for mail delivery trucks — and most of the electrical infrastructure is buried under ground, the potential for raising money at auction is ""negligible,"" according to Pastre. Pastre was direct about the harm this action would cause the Postal Service saying, ""it will seriously cripple our ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet."" Since 2015, the USPS has been looking to update and modernize its fleet of more than 200,000 vehicles. The majority of the trucks were 25 years old or more, often lacked proper heating and cooling and in some cases, would spontaneously combust in neighborhoods as workers operated the aging vehicles. When the Postal Service first announced its proposal in 2021 to replace 165,000 vehicles, it originally intended to purchase traditional gas vehicles to replace 90% of the fleet. But the gas-powered mail trucks had low fuel efficiency, guzzling fuel at under a 9-m.p.g. rate, according to filings by several environmental organizations and more than a dozen states that sued to block the plan. ""It's important that EVs be part of the mix for the USPS because it should represent the next generation,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the organizations that sued the USPS in 2021. ""The last generation of vehicles are literally dying on its wheels."" The legal action forced the USPS to reconsider its plan, and it finalized a deal in late 2022 to purchase 106,000 new cars — and 66,000 were to be zero-emissions vehicles. It also planned to install more than 14,000 chargers to keep the fleet running. The cost to update the fleet totaled $9.6 billion, and the Biden administration allocated $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to help cover the costs, with the rest financed by the Postal Service. ""My bet is this will survive another day,"" said Becker, given that the parliamentarian has ruled it should be stricken and it would be difficult to get 60 votes in the Senate to keep it in the bill. But Congress recently voted to revoke California's EPA waivers to enact its EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act, which the parliamentarian said was illegal. It remains to be seen if Republicans will follow her recommendations. ""Selling them off at a discount just so you don't have to say you don't have EVs for political reasons makes no sense,"" said Becker.

In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material. Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was ""quintessentially transformative"" and did not violate ""fair use"" doctrine under copyright law. ""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,"" his decision states. By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles. Authors had filed suit Anthropic cheered the ruling. The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to ""large-scale theft."" The authors also alleged that Anthropic ""seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works."" The authors' attorneys declined comment. Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots. At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

The partnership comes as MLB seeks to reach younger audiences through authentic digital content creators. Jomboy Media recorded 93 million social media engagements last year and has grown since its humble beginnings as a hobby podcast in 2017. Co-founder Jake Storiale said the company never envisioned reaching this scale when he and Jimmy O'Brien started their weekly Yankees podcast. ""The original dream was maybe like the kooky spring training guys or something like that,"" Storiale said during an appearance on ""CBS Mornings Plus"" Monday. ""And now it's turned into a 60-person business."" The deal represents years of parallel work between the organizations, according to Courtney Hirsch, the CEO of Jomboy Media and O'Brien's sister, who helped broker the partnership. ""We both have the same mission to grow the game and to serve baseball fans,"" Hirsch said. ""It took years in the making."" What finally pushed the partnership over the finish line after years of discussions was the growing influence of digital content creators in sports, Hirsch said. ""I think the power of content creators is really undeniable, and the impact that they're having on sports,"" she said. ""Major League Baseball recognizes that it's important to have authentic voices speaking to fans, and then also creating content on digital platforms like we do to reach people where they're at and create new fans because that's really our superpower."" Jomboy Media has expanded beyond baseball commentary to include multiple podcasts, TV shows and warehouse games featuring backyard-style sports competitions. The company's breakdown videos, which often include lip-reading analysis of on-field conversations and confrontations, have become particularly popular for bringing viewers closer to the action. ""Sports is the best reality television still,"" Storiale said. ""The breakdown videos that Jimmy does, I mean it brings you on the field and that's kind of what fans want."" The company name originated from an iPhone autocorrect error that changed ""Jimmy"" to ""Jomboy,"" which O'Brien adopted as his social media handle on his mother's advice to use a nickname online, Hirsch said.

Eight children have come down with severe food poisoning since June 12 after consuming meat products from the two businesses in the northern city of Saint-Quentin. Five of them contracted a rare foodborne illness called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including a 12-year-old girl who died. HUS in most cases occurs after someone ingests E.coli , commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is ""impossible at this stage to confirm that the consumption of products from these two establishments is the source of the contamination,"" local authorities said. But the children all consumed meat or meat products from these two butchers a few days before symptoms appeared, it said. Authorities have closed the two shops as a precautionary measure while samples from both stores are tested. The authorities said they should have the results ""early next week"" and an investigation has been launched into where the meat came from. HUS affects between 100 and 165 children in France each year, according to the country's public health agency. E. coli outbreaks have also made headlines recently in the U.S. Earlier this month, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that ground beef that was distributed nationwide may be contaminated with E. coli. In November, a carrot recall was issued by California grower Grimmway Farms after nearly 40 cases were recorded in 18 states. At least 15 people were hospitalized and one person died, the CDC said .

The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption. This image from video shows a SpaceX Starship upper stage exploding at the Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, June 18, 2025. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV. But the company said there is ""no commonality"" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship. ""Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,"" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. ""If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design."" The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week. Such ""hotfire"" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th ""integrated flight test."" But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing. The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast. Flames rise as a SpaceX rocket explodes ahead of an engine test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, June 18, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted. ""On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" SpaceX said in a statement on X. ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. ""There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area."" What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known. NASA counting on Starship for moon mission SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages. The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. It will not be easy. To get the Human Landing System — HLS — Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a ""depot"" Starship, undock, and return to Earth. The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule. SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon. NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement. While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that ""NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions."" ""We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission."" Elon Musk SpaceX",2025-06-24T17:10:38.200394

On his way to The Hague on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to stay in Washington until they can resolve their issues and get the bill — which extends the president's 2017 tax cuts and includes much of his second-term agenda — to his desk. ""NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT'S DONE,"" he wrote on Truth Social . The last scheduled day in session for both chambers before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving them with little time to reach their goal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who met with Senate Republicans Tuesday, told reporters after the meeting that they're ""on track"" for a vote Friday on the bill, adding that he expects it can get to the president's desk by July 4. Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, threatened to keep senators in Washington over the recess as several Republicans cast doubt about the upper chamber's ability to finish their work before the deadline. Thune told reporters Monday that the Senate is ""on schedule"" to vote by the end of the week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune leaves the Senate Republicans' lunch in the U.S. Capitol on June 24, 2025. The bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, narrowly passed the House last month, but Senate Republicans are making changes in order to navigate the party's tight 53-47 margin in the upper chamber. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he told House Republicans to ""keep your schedules flexible"" as the Senate looks to send the legislation back to the lower chamber for approval. The Louisiana Republican predicted the Senate could pass the bill by Friday or Saturday. The timing of a House vote would eat into next week's recess. ""There's nothing more important that we should be involved in and can be involved in than getting the one big, beautiful bill to the president's desk,"" Johnson said at his weekly news conference. Parliamentarian rulings Days before an expected vote, the Senate's final version has yet to come together. The Senate's rulekeeper has been looking through the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate the upper chamber's rules. The Senate parliamentarian advised that several controversial provisions would violate the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending, according to Senate Budget Committee Democrats. Provisions that did not make the cut are subject to a 60-vote threshold, compared with the 51 votes needed under the reconciliation process. Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court. The provision limited the ability of federal courts to delay or halt the government's policies by requiring people suing the federal government to post a bond to cover the potential costs and damages incurred by the government. The parliamentarian determined that a provision to bar immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, should also be removed. The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal championed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands. Other provisions struck from the bill include the sale of electric vehicles used by the United States Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for ""sanctuary cities"" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement. But the parliamentarian did allow Republicans to keep a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating artificial intelligence. SALT sticking points As the Senate lurches toward a vote on the bill, disagreement over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, has persisted. But Bessent said Tuesday afternoon that he expected a solution on what's become one of the biggest sticking points will be reached in the next 24 to 48 hours. While the House measure increases the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, the Senate Finance Committee's version that was unveiled last week proposes permanently extending the $10,000 cap. The chasm sparked pushback among blue-state House Republicans, who have threatened to withhold their support should the Senate approve the changes and send it back to the House. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who formerly served in the House and has worked as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters Monday that ""neither side is going to love where we're at, but it's going to be acceptable."" ""The Senate wants to go further to the right and the SALT caucus wants to go further to the left,"" Mullin said. ""We're going to find, I think, hopefully some place right in the middle that both sides can live with."" Medicaid and the provider tax Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes — which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs — from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, after the House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. But the move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House. A group of 16 House Republicans penned a letter to Thune and Johnson Tuesday opposing the Senate's changes to the House-passed legislation on Medicaid. The moderates argued that the House approach ""reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard,"" pointing in particular to the provisions restricting the provider tax within the Senate legislation. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has voiced opposition to the provider tax changes, and said more senators spoke up at Tuesday's lunch against the Senate's provider tax proposal. Fiscal hawks speak out Another faction in Congress has voiced opposition to the spending levels in the legislation, advocating for deeper cuts that have often worked counter to leadership's efforts to appease other members of their conferences. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who initially threatened to withhold their support for the House-passed legislation have suggested they would tank the Senate's changes to the bill. And a number of Senate Republicans have voiced strong opposition to the legislation's impact on the deficit. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida was among a handful of Senate Republicans who met with Mr. Trump on Monday amid opposition from fiscal hawks. Despite the disagreements, he told reporters that ""I'm the eternal optimist that we're going to figure this out.""",2025-06-24T17:10:39.853676

NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement. While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that ""NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions."" ""We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission."" Elon Musk SpaceX",2025-06-24T17:10:41.467877

Here's what to know.,14,293,17,4,"First-ever Starbucks Global Barista champion crowned 00:49 Starbucks said Tuesday that the coffee chain is changing how it charges for beverage add-ins like matcha and syrups as it moves to standardize pricing across the company's stores. Starbucks will now charge 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce that modifies an unflavored drink, instead of charging for each addition. But the company noted that it won't charge customers to substitute a sauce or syrup in a pre-flavored drink, such as adding vanilla syrup to a Caffè Mocha. Starbucks also plans to charge $1 for adding a scoop of matcha powder to non-matcha drinks, and will charge 50 cents to include dried fruit in a beverage. The changes were reported earlier by Bloomberg News. The change is the latest under CEO Brian Niccol, who wants to overhaul the coffee giant's image as it looks to drive growth. As part of that effort, Niccol wants to improve customer service and ensure that Starbucks cafes are "" inviting places to linger ,"" among other goals and initiatives. The company on Tuesday also said it's conducting a limited customer test of a new feature in the Starbucks app to show pricing updates in real time when a consumer is ordering food or drinks. The goal is to provide better pricing transparency when people place an order, a Starbucks spokesperson said. Starbucks said customers can add its classic syrup, a liquid sugar akin to simple syrup, to any drink at no cost. Starbucks",2025-06-24T17:10:43.077013

Here's what the experts say.,17,899,23,4,"Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt world oil prices 03:32 The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans. The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz , a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets. Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours. The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil. ""In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,"" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report. But, he added, ""[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long."" Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices. What's the impact so far on oil prices? After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06. Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68. Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring. ""Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,"" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report. Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy. What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed? Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring. Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy. Map of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz showing maritime tanker traffic in September 2024. The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts. ""[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,"" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. ""In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP."" The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation. What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices? American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said. ""Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,"" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA. Iran Gas Prices Oil and Gas",2025-06-24T17:10:44.713285

If you've been able to save up $10,000 or more in today's economy, then you're going to want to get as much out of that money as possible. Some savers may find it valuable to play the stock market, but with uncertainty there elevated and predictions varied for long-term success, that may not be a risk worth taking. And with select savings vehicles still offering interest rates in the 4% to 5% range , it's a risk many don't need to take right now, especially when considering a certificate of deposit (CD) account . Sure, CD interest rates aren't quite as high as they were in 2023 or 2024, but they're still many times higher than they were five years ago. And CD rates are fixed , meaning savers will earn those high returns even if rate cuts are issued during the CD term . To get a better idea of the potential return on your savings deposit, then, it may be worth comparing the interest-earning potential of today's top CD accounts versus what can be secured with a traditional saving account at the same time. Below, we'll calculate the interest. See how much more money you could be earning with a top CD account here . $10,000 CD vs. $10,000 traditional savings account: Here's which earns more now When comparing an account with a fixed rate of interest versus one with a variable one, it can become difficult, if not impossible, to determine the interest-earning potential of both. After all, a variable interest rate means returns will fluctuate over time, so it's not a true apples-to-apples comparison. And that's the case here as a CD rate is fixed while a traditional savings account rate is variable. But unlike when comparing a CD against a high-yield savings account or a money market account , matching it up against a traditional savings account clearly underlines the benefit of the latter type, thanks to an average traditional savings account rate under 0.40% now . In other words, even if rates on the account were to change over time, as they inevitably will, they're highly unlikely to rise high enough to be even competitive with the top CDs, let alone supersede them. Here's what the returns would look like now, assuming the traditional account rate remains the same for the full time frame: $10,000 6-month CD at 4.49%: $222.04 for a total of $10,222.04 $10,000 6-month traditional savings account at 0.38%: $18.98 for a total of $10,018.98 Difference between both: The CD earns $203.06 more. $10,000 9-month CD at 4.31%: $321.54 for a total of $10,321.54 $10,000 9-month traditional savings account at 0.38%: $28.49 for a total of $10,028.49 Difference between both: The CD earns $293.05 more. $10,000 1-year CD at 4.40%: $440.00 for a total of $10,440.00 $10,000 1-year traditional savings account at 0.38%: $38.00 for a total of $10,038.00 Difference between both: The CD earns $402 more. $10,000 18-month CD at 4.16%: $630.45 for a total of $10,630.45 $10,000 18-month traditional savings account at 0.38%: $57.05 for a total of $10,057.05 Difference between both: The CD earns $573.40 more. So, no matter the CD term, the account still earns savers hundreds of dollars more than a traditional savings account will if opened now. And the former account returns are guaranteed, while the minimal savings account one could fall even further, especially over one year or longer. Comparing these two account options, then, it becomes clear that the home for your $10,000 deposit should be a CD. Lock in a high rate on a CD here now . The bottom line A CD comes with substantially higher interest rates than traditional savings accounts right now, making them a clear choice to park $10,000 or more of your money in today's economy. Just be sure to deposit an amount that you can comfortably afford to part with for the full CD term to avoid having to pay an early withdrawal penalty to regain access to your funds. And, if you have smaller amounts of money in a traditional savings account, consider moving it out and into a CD or high-yield savings account instead to exploit this high-rate climate while still advantageous for savers.",2025-06-24T17:10:46.514994

Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire . The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs . The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said last week Iran was ""very close to having"" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran ""is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly."" The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but ""pressure has probably built on him to do so"" — noting an ""erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public."" Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes. Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was ""wrong"" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, ""I think they were very close to having one."" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was ""taking my testimony out of context."" The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time. Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes. ""They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,"" Rubio said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."" ""[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,"" she added. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, ""The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making — especially for military combat operations and deployment."" ""The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions —which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,"" Parnell said.

Investing in gold isn't always an easy decision, even for veterans and those experienced in the precious metal industry. That's partially because gold is less of an income producer like stocks and bonds typically are, and much more of an income protector. That's thanks to a steady value even during periods of economic turmoil, as has been seen in recent years when the price surged during a high inflationary period. So, gold needs to be approached in a different manner than traditional assets. And that approach will need to be particularly strategic for beginner gold investors , especially as they head into July 2025, when the price of the metal could easily surge to yet another new record. For investors with minimal or no experience in the precious metal industry, then, it can help to contemplate a few critical decisions before getting started. Below, we'll examine three to consider before July 1. Learn how gold can protect your portfolio here . 3 decisions beginner gold investors should consider before July By contemplating these decisions and working toward an answer before the new month, beginner gold investors can better position themselves for success: The decision to wait for a price drop Gold has been on such a steady price rise – up more than 90% over the past five years – that it may seem foolish to wait for a price drop . But gold does have some minor fluctuations in price that savvy investors may be able to exploit. However, it will take consistent monitoring of the market to find these openings, and investors will need to act quickly to take advantage. It's also worth noting that the potential for the price of gold to fall in any material way is especially low now, and there's also a risk that waiting too long could cause investors to get priced out altogether. This will need to be done strategically and carefully, and if you know you need the benefits of a gold investment can provide, it may just be worth buying in now before the next inevitable price record. See how much a gold investment could cost you now . The decision about how much to invest The common gold investing threshold is often 10% of your overall portfolio . But there's a big difference between 1% and 10% in that range, and, for beginners with a greater investing horizon, it may be closer to the double-digit portion. The decision on where your investment portion should lie, then, will depend on your goals, the volatility (or lack thereof) in your portfolio currently, and your budget. But with a series of factors that drive the price of gold prevalent right now, it can behoove you to make this decision sooner than later. So, consider speaking with a financial advisor or gold investing company who can answer your questions and guide you toward the right amount of gold to invest for your specific portfolio. The decision about your portfolio needs Gold can be a reliable portfolio diversifier and a consistent way to hedge against inflation . Right now, it may even provide a timely way to make a quick profit by buying in before the next price spike. But are those items your portfolio really needs currently, especially if you're just starting to build your retirement funds? Only you will know the answer to that question, but it's an important one to contemplate, especially if the alternative is to rush into a precious metal investment now to circumvent any expensive price changes. Consider beginning with an overall idea of what your portfolio needs, then move on to determine where gold can fit in. The bottom line A gold investment can be advantageous for investors of all ages, including beginners. To make it as beneficial as possible, however, especially in the unique gold investing climate of summer 2025, beginners should contemplate the above three decisions now. By reviewing these carefully and by being pragmatic in their answers, they can improve their chances of gold investing success both now and, theoretically, in the months and years ahead.",2025-06-24T17:10:51.364002

A psychologist shares tips for better sleep.,13,957,15,28,"Why aging affects sleep and expert tips to improve it 04:54 About 10% of Americans say they have chronic insomnia , and millions of others report poor sleep quality. Ongoing research has found that bad sleep could lead to numerous health problems, including heart disease . Dr. Julio Fernandez-Mendoza is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, neuroscience and public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine. He discusses the need for sleep, why teenagers require more sleep than adults, and how you can get a good night's sleep without medications. The Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion that have been edited for brevity and clarity. How much sleep is enough for adults and for adolescents? Julio Fernandez-Mendoza: Adults who report getting about seven to eight hours of sleep per night generally have the best health , in terms of both physical and mental health, and longevity. But that recommendation changes with age . Adults over age 65 may need just six to seven hours of sleep per night. So older people, if otherwise healthy, should not feel anxious if they're getting just six hours. Young people need the most – at least nine hours – and some younger children may need more. How can insufficient sleep harm our health? Fernandez-Mendoza: Our team was the first to show that those complaining about insomnia – difficulty falling or staying asleep – were more likely to have high blood pressure and be at risk for heart disease . In both teens and adults, we found that insomnia and shortened sleep may lead to elevated stress, hormone levels and inflammation . These problems tend to show up before you develop heart disease . As we age, the recommended amount of sleep declines. National Sleep Foundation What about people who have more serious sleep problems? Fernandez-Mendoza: Good sleep hygiene habits include cutting down on caffeine and alcohol, quitting smoking and exercising regularly. I also recommend not skipping meals, not eating too late at night and not eating too much. But people with a persistent sleep problem may need to make more behavioral changes. Research studies point to a set of six rules that can improve your sleep. You can follow these changes consistently in the short term, and then choose how to adapt them into your lifestyle down the road. First, get up at the same time no matter what. No matter how much sleep you get. This will anchor your sleep/wake cycle, called your circadian rhythm . Second, do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sexual activity. Third, when you can't sleep, don't lie in bed awake. Instead, get out of bed, go into another room if you can, and do an activity that's enjoyable or relaxing. Go back to bed only when you're ready to sleep. Fourth, get going with daily activities even after a poor night's sleep. Don't try to compensate for sleep loss. If you have chronic insomnia, don't nap, sleep in, or doze during the day or evening even after poor sleep the previous night. Fifth, go to bed only when you're actually sleepy enough to fall asleep. And sixth, start with the amount of sleep you're now getting – with the lowest limit at five hours – and then increase it weekly by 15 minutes. These six rules are evidence-based and go above and beyond simple sleep hygiene habits. If they don't work, see a provider who can help you. Do you have advice specifically for adolescents? Fernandez-Mendoza: Adolescence is a unique developmental period. It's not just the obvious physical, emotional and behavioral changes that occur during adolescence and puberty – there are changes in a teenager's brain that can alter their sleep patterns. When an adolescent goes through puberty, their internal clock changes so that their sleep schedule shifts to later hours . While it's true that adolescents are more engaged at night because of their social relationships, there's also biology behind why they want to stay up late – their internal clocks have shifted. It's not just choice. School start times for most adolescents are at odds with that biological shift . So they don't get enough sleep, which affects their performance in school. Research suggests that schools with later start times are more closely aligned with the science on child development and don't put adolescents at risk by making them wake up earlier than their bodies are biologically inclined to. Parents can help their teens get better sleep. Set a time for kids to stop doing homework and put away electronics . Instead, they can watch TV with the family or read – something relaxing and enjoyable that will help them wind down before bed. You can also gradually move back their wake-up time. Start on weekends, waking them up 30 minutes earlier every day, including school days, until the child reaches the desired wake-up time. Don't try to reshift them suddenly – for example, waking up a teenager at 5 a.m. like it's the military – because that doesn't work. They won't get used to it, since it's at odds with their internal clock. So, do it little by little. If that doesn't work, see a clinical provider. What kind of treatments can a sleep clinician provide? Fernandez-Mendoza: People should get help if they feel they sleep poorly, if they're fatigued during the day, or if they snore or grind their teeth. All these issues deserve attention. Some people may think a sleep provider just prescribes expensive medication, but that's not true. There are behavioral, non-drug-based treatments that work. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment recommended for insomnia . Light therapy may also help, which is the use of a bright light therapy lamp at a given time during the day or evening, depending on the person's sleep problem. Watch the full interview to hear more.

Here's what to know.,17,663,14,12,"Invasive ants spotted in dozens of states pose danger to humans, environment 03:35 The Joro spider , Asian long-horned beetle and spotted lanternfly have company this summer. A ""sneaky"" invasive species that has a potentially deadly sting continues to spread across the U.S. and can be found in more than a dozen states, according to experts. Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the species has continued to expand its reach, primarily throughout the Southeast, and this pest could potentially be deadly to humans, according to Dan Suiter , a professor of urban entomology at the University of Georgia. ""It injects venom that can harm you. Its sting can be life threatening,"" Suiter recently told the university. Suiter added that people who have adverse reactions to bee and ant stings are especially vulnerable and could go into anaphylactic shock from the needle ant's sting. Anaphylaxis is a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction that can occur within seconds of being exposed to something you're allergic to, such as a sting, according to the Mayo Clinic . ""If you suffer from anaphylaxis, you should really know what this ant looks like,"" Suiter says. ""And it might be smart to carry an EpiPen."" Suiter urged people to be vigilant for these invasive species, especially with ant populations peaking later this summer. What are Asian needle ants? Asian needle ants are technically known as Brachyponera chinensis — roughly translated as ""short, wicked ant from China"" — but their native range also includes Japan and the Koreas, according to the U.S. Forest Service . The insect was first discovered in the U.S. in 1932 in Georgia, but has only recently started to ""cause problems in North America after being relatively unnoticed for many years,"" the U.S. Forest Service says . Asian needle ants were first detected in the U.S. almost a century ago, but the invasive species has continued to spread, experts say. U.S. Department of Agriculture The pest has now been detected all the way from Washington state to Florida, according to the site antmaps.org as well as Mississippi State University , and the ant is recently getting more attention in Texas . Suiter says Asian needle ants are ""sneaky"" because they are less than a quarter of an inch long and are adept at hiding. ""Unlike many invasive species that tend to colonize areas in the wake of natural or human disturbance, Asian needle ants are capable of invading undisturbed forest areas where they nest under and within logs and other debris, under stones, and in leaf litter,"" the U.S. Forest Service says. Environmental impacts According to Suiter, Asian needle ants wreak havoc in native environments. ""They outcompete other ant species that are important to the ecology of that area,"" he says. Asian needle ants prey on other insects and are capable of displacing ant species that are critical for seed dispersal, according to the U.S. Forest Service. Researchers have documented large decreases in seed dispersal in forests where Asian needle ants are present. ""Thus, this invasive species could have dramatic, long-term negative effects on forest understory,"" the service says. What should people do if they see Asian needle ants? Asian needle ants are about 0.2 inches in length, and dark brown or black with the end of the antennae and the legs being a lighter orange-brown, the U.S. Forest Service says. Other ant species can look similar, ""so it takes an experienced eye to positively identify them,"" the service says. Suiter says that you can send a photograph or a specimen to a local University of Georgia Extension office, which can help with identification. The public can also contact a professional to come out and bait for the ants, he says. The U.S. Forest Service advises people to avoid the pest and to be especially vigilant in areas with logs, rotting wood or rocks where the ants can nest. ""Unfortunately, as with many invasive species, it appears Asian needle ants are here to stay,"" the service says. United States Department of Agriculture",2025-06-24T17:10:58.030259

Jesus Sarmiento, who had nearly 80,000 followers on TikTok, was murdered over the weekend by armed men who broke into the residence where he was staying. In the video shared on social media, a woman banging on a door and screaming for help can be heard in the background. ""They shot me, they shot me,"" Sarmiento says, as blood is visible on the floor. Two armed men appear briefly before the stream ends. ""Attorney General Tarek William Saab announces that the Public Prosecutor's Office... has been tasked with investigating, identifying, and punishing those responsible for the assassination of Jesus Sarmiento,"" the prosecutor's office announced on Instagram on Monday. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Fiscal General de Venezuela 🇻🇪 (@mpublicove) Sarmiento had ""denounced the threats he was receiving from members of GEDOS (Structured Organized Crime Group) and alleged police officers,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement. In his TikTok posts, Sarmiento spoke about the leader of the Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero, who is one of the country's most wanted criminals known by the alias ""Nino Guerrero."" The U.S. State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Venezuelan government has maintained that the Tren de Aragua — which the U.S. considers a ""terrorist"" organization — has already been dismantled and denies its existence. Sarmiento shared photos and videos of alleged members of the gang and denounced the ""extortion"" by police officers. ""I was kidnapped by... DAET — the police's Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions,"" he stated in one of his final videos. ""We are overrun with delinquent officials who work with common criminals,"" he added. Sarmiento's murder marks the latest in a string of deadly attacks on popular social media figures. Earlier this month, Pakistani police said 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf was shot dead by a man who had repeatedly contacted her online. And last month, the murder of a young influencer during a livestream in Jalisco, in western Mexico, shocked the country. Authorities insisted there was no ""evidence"" that the murder of 23-year-old Valeria Márquez was linked to organized crime, and prosecutors opened an investigation for ""femicide.""

The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be ""helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks."" The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program. In response to the strikes, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties. The attack came after Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran. Israeli officials have said at least 28 people in Israel have died in Iran's missile attacks. A ceasefire announced by President Trump between Israel and Iran appears to be holding on Tuesday, with the two sides halting their exchange of fire after 12 days.

He was 81. His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram : ""Bobby left this world holding my hand — just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light."" Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year. American singer and teen idol Bobby Sherman, circa 1970. Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of ""TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols."" He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s. Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — ""Little Woman,"" ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me,"" ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" and ""La La La (If I Had You)."" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including ""Here Comes Bobby,"" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show ""Shindig!"" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series — ""Here Come the Brides"" (1968-70) and ""Getting Together"" (1971). After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times."" Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band. ""I was brought up in a fairly strict family,"" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. ""Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous."" Singer Bobby Sherman at a recording session in Los Angeles, March 13, 1967. He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda , Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with ""Shindig!"" Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in ""Here Come the Brides,"" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, ""Seattle,"" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons. Following the series, Sherman starred in ""Getting Together,"" a spinoff of ""The Partridge Family,"" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, ""Little Woman,"" earned a gold record in 1969. ""While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,"" The Tulsa World said in 1997. His movies included ""Wild In Streets,"" ""He is My Brother"" and ""Get Crazy."" Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: ""I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was."" Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross. ""If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times. ""I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody."" In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations. In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. ""When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the ""Twice a Citizen"" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: ""Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America."" Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era ""Teen Idols Tour"" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: ""Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group."" Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.

In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material. Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was ""quintessentially transformative"" and did not violate ""fair use"" doctrine under copyright law. ""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,"" his decision states. By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles. Authors had filed suit Anthropic cheered the ruling. The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to ""large-scale theft."" The authors also alleged that Anthropic ""seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works."" The authors' attorneys declined comment. Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots. At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

These expert tips can help.,13,500,18,3,"Understanding why we can't fall asleep at night 03:33 Ever doze off on the couch while watching the game or your favorite show, only to move to your bed and lie awake? It's a frustrating sleep phenomenon that has a psychological explanation. Licensed psychologist Lisa Strauss told told ""CBS Mornings Plus"" there are a few reasons it can be difficult to get back to sleep after snoozing on the couch. Why is it so hard to fall back asleep? One reason is the effort it takes to make the transition from couch to bed. ""Standing up, moving to the bedroom, having the mind reengage, brings us to wakefulness very rapidly,"" she said, noting that ""falling asleep ... can take 10 to 20 minutes under supportive conditions. So there's this temporal asymmetry between how quickly we come to wakefulness and how long it takes us to fall back to sleep."" You can also get distracted with other things. ""People give themselves all kinds of responsibilities to fulfill,"" she said. ""People will let the dog out and back in again. They'll be checking their email."" Even some aspects of your bedtime routine can be more stimulating than you might have realized. ""Even those people whose main intention is just to get themselves to bed, they don't make a mere pit stop in the bathroom,"" Strauss said. ""On the way to bed, they go into the bathroom under bright lights. They'll take their medication. They'll put in their eye drops. They're washing up, then they go into the bedroom, then they put on their pajamas. They're having a conversation with their spouse."" Tips to transition from couch to bed to sleep for the night Preparation is key. Make sure you're already in your pajamas and have done your nightly checklist before getting cozy on the couch. ""That way, if you fall asleep, you can quickly move to bed without needing to wake yourself up doing a bedtime routine,"" Strauss said. Next, be mindful of your drowsiness. While it can be easy to drift off to dreamland when your eyelids start getting heavy, Strauss instead recommends using that as a sign to get in bed. ""You want to catch yourself very early in the process of sleepiness. You don't want to have to sentence yourself to starting over again,"" she said. ""So when you're starting to feel your breathing slow a little, your thinking slow, it's a little harder to focus your eyes — that's when you want to get up and you want to go to bed."" Once in bed, try not to focus too hard on sleep, as it can cause a sort of performance anxiety that keeps you up even longer worrying about why you're still awake. ""If you try to chase the squirrel of sleep, it will run away,"" she warned. ""It's very skittish."" Sleep",2025-06-24T17:11:06.154597

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops. The Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible. Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:11:07.785679

Experts weigh in,14,811,21,5,"Before borrowing money from their home, owners should first examine their debt situation. More homeowners are considering home equity loans in 2025 as interest rates have settled around 8.23% . While that's still above the rates of recent years, it beats paying over 20% on credit cards or an average of 12.47% on personal loans . With household debt at high levels, tapping home equity is tempting — but it's not always wise. This raises a critical question: When does your existing debt load make a home equity loan too risky or impossible? We asked three industry professionals to share their insights. Below, they explore the signs you may be overextending and offer advice on how to set yourself up for successful home equity borrowing. Start by seeing how much home equity you could borrow here . How much debt is too much for a home equity loan? There's no single formula for figuring out how much debt is too much for home equity borrowing. However, experts, including Christopher L. Stroup, a certified financial planner and president of Silicon Beach Financial, warn that attractive rates can lure borrowers into taking on excessive debt. ""At a certain point, [more] debt could tip the balance between manageable and unsustainable, especially if your income or home value shifts,"" he cautions. When considering a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (HELOC) , experts recommend examining your entire financial picture — not only the interest rate. The following indicators may hint that a home equity loan is too risky or untenable: High debt-to-income (DTI) ratio Most home lenders want to see your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio at 36% or lower. ""[But] some will go up to 43% if you have a high credit score, strong down payment and stable employment,"" says Pahmela Foxley, vice president of mortgage lending at Wasatch Peaks Credit Union. According to Steven Glick, director of mortgage sales at real estate investment fintech company HomeAbroad, a DTI ratio above 43% is a big red flag. ""If you're spending nearly half your income on debt already, adding a home equity loan payment could strain your budget to the breaking point,"" he explains. Keeping the ratio below 36% will allow you more flexibility should surprise expenses arise. Check your home equity loan qualifications here now . Low credit score ""A credit score below 680, especially under 620, screams risk to lenders,"" says Glick. It may point to past debt management challenges that have not been addressed or resolved. Beyond making approval harder, Stroup points out that a low credit score will drive up your interest rate. If your score is below 620, improve it before applying for a home equity loan. Pay down credit card balances and make all payments on time for several months to qualify for better rates. Low home equity Lenders often ask for at least 20% equity in your home. ""If you've got less — say only 10% — a market dip could leave you underwater, owing more than your home's worth,"" Glick explains. If you're close to the 20% threshold, consider building more equity before applying. In the meantime, paying more toward your principal can help shrink your mortgage balance faster. You may also complete strategic home upgrades to increase your property's value . Unstable income ""If your income fluctuates [a lot] or you've recently changed jobs, lenders get wary,"" Glick warns. Stroup agrees, noting that red flags include job hopping, recent career pivots or highly seasonal earnings. ""Even a high income doesn't mean stability if it's unpredictable,"" he emphasizes. W-2 employees with steady salaries have the easiest path to approval, while self-employed borrowers or commission workers face more scrutiny. If your income varies by more than 20% month-to-month, establish consistency for at least two years before considering a home equity loan. Lack of an emergency fund ""Lacking an emergency fund signals you're borrowing from a place of financial fragility,"" Stroup says. Since home equity loans put your house at risk, you need a cash cushion in case of job loss or medical emergencies. Experts advise saving at least three to six months of living expenses before taking out a home equity loan. And if you're self-employed, you should aim even higher. ""Six to 12 months is recommended,"" notes Foxley. The bottom line Taking out a home equity loan can be smart , but it requires honest self-assessment. First, ask yourself: ""What's my backup plan if circumstances change?"" Glick suggests assessing your full debt picture and planning for the worst-case scenario before borrowing. If you're not ready yet, focus on improving your financial position. Pay down high-interest debt, build your emergency fund and boost your credit score. Strengthening these fundamentals now could save you from putting your home in jeopardy .",2025-06-24T17:11:09.570779

Jesus Sarmiento, who had nearly 80,000 followers on TikTok, was murdered over the weekend by armed men who broke into the residence where he was staying. In the video shared on social media, a woman banging on a door and screaming for help can be heard in the background. ""They shot me, they shot me,"" Sarmiento says, as blood is visible on the floor. Two armed men appear briefly before the stream ends. ""Attorney General Tarek William Saab announces that the Public Prosecutor's Office... has been tasked with investigating, identifying, and punishing those responsible for the assassination of Jesus Sarmiento,"" the prosecutor's office announced on Instagram on Monday. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Fiscal General de Venezuela 🇻🇪 (@mpublicove) Sarmiento had ""denounced the threats he was receiving from members of GEDOS (Structured Organized Crime Group) and alleged police officers,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement. In his TikTok posts, Sarmiento spoke about the leader of the Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero, who is one of the country's most wanted criminals known by the alias ""Nino Guerrero."" The U.S. State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Venezuelan government has maintained that the Tren de Aragua — which the U.S. considers a ""terrorist"" organization — has already been dismantled and denies its existence. Sarmiento shared photos and videos of alleged members of the gang and denounced the ""extortion"" by police officers. ""I was kidnapped by... DAET — the police's Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions,"" he stated in one of his final videos. ""We are overrun with delinquent officials who work with common criminals,"" he added. Sarmiento's murder marks the latest in a string of deadly attacks on popular social media figures. Earlier this month, Pakistani police said 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf was shot dead by a man who had repeatedly contacted her online. And last month, the murder of a young influencer during a livestream in Jalisco, in western Mexico, shocked the country. Authorities insisted there was no ""evidence"" that the murder of 23-year-old Valeria Márquez was linked to organized crime, and prosecutors opened an investigation for ""femicide.""

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. ""The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29."" Jerome Powell Interest Rates Federal Reserve",2025-06-24T17:11:12.901158

The Danish drugmaker said Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold ""illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies said they were entering a ""long-term collaboration"" to make obesity treatment more accessible. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales. Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using ""knock-off, compounded versions"" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug. This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices. ""After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration."" The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF. In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA. ""U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,"" Novo Nordisk said. Novo Nordisk will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms that ""share our commitment to patient safety,"" said Dave Moore, executive vice president at Novo Nordisk, in the company's statement .

Those over 40 should exercise like this every day, researchers say",18,374,21,4,"Lifestyle changes could prevent nearly half of adult cancer deaths, study finds 01:41 Exercising like the most active 25% of Americans can help those over 40 add an extra 5 years to their life on average, according to new research. In the study, published Thursday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine , researchers created a predictive model to estimate the impact of different levels of physical activity on life expectancy using data about people who were at least 40 years old from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey and other sources. Though it was an observational study, which doesn't prove cause and effect, the findings suggest increased focus on physical activity can potentially pay off in terms of Americans' lifespans. ""Our findings suggest that (physical activity) provides substantially larger health benefits than previously thought, which is due to the use of more precise means of measuring (it),"" the authors wrote. So how much do you have to exercise to gain the potential benefits? The total physical activity of the most active 25% of Americans was equivalent to 160 minutes of walking at a normal pace, or about 3 miles per hour, every day, according to the study. If all Americans over 40 matched this level of activity, life expectancy at birth would bump from 78.6 years to nearly 84 years, about a 5-year increase in average lifespan. If the least active Americans committed to an extra 111 minutes of walking daily, the effects were even more dramatic, the estimates indicate — adding almost 11 years to the average lifespan. This isn't the first time research has highlighted the health benefits of walking . A study last year from the same journal found walking just 11 minutes per day could significantly lower the risk of stroke, heart disease and some cancers. Other viral fitness trends like the ""hot girl walk"" and ""fart walk"" have also encouraged Americans to get their walking shoes on for a number of physical and mental health positives.

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note.

Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire . The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs . The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said last week Iran was ""very close to having"" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran ""is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly."" The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but ""pressure has probably built on him to do so"" — noting an ""erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public."" Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes. Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was ""wrong"" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, ""I think they were very close to having one."" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was ""taking my testimony out of context."" The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time. Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes. ""They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,"" Rubio said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."" ""[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,"" she added. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, ""The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making — especially for military combat operations and deployment."" ""The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions —which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,"" Parnell said.

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety. While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings. In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse. In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head."" According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America. This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire . On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities."" Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back."" She added, ""We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Iran",2025-06-24T17:11:26.095672

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.

IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles.

The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport.

""Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,"" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work project , comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads. To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine. ""You want to get in a dialogue with it,"" Fuller said. ""You want to ask it to take different perspectives."" Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy. Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies. ""If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,"" McRae said. Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses. ""If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,"" Raman said. Hone your soft skills Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks — think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example —more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication. ""You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,"" LinkedIn's Raman said. ""You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking."" The focus will be less on your pedigree — where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree — he added, and more on what he calls the ""5 Cs"": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication. To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations. ""The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,"" he said. The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace. Choose your employer wisely Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years. ""The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work — not what you do at the place you're going to work,"" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch. He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce — as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said. In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like. ""What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?"" she said. In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap."" Palestinian women and girls mourn relatives killed while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty ""Humanitarian principles must be reinstated,"" Lazzarini said in his statement. ""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety. While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings. In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse. In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head."" According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America. This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire . On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities."" Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back."" She added, ""We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Iran",2025-06-24T17:11:37.595574

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. First Responders look at destruction caused by an Iranian missile strike in Beersheba, southern Israel, June 24, 2025. Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: ""ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.""

Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport.

But there are ways to improve sleep issues . Why getting a good night's rest can get harder with aging Sleep psychologist Shelby Harris told ""CBS Mornings Plus "" that stress, sleep structure and hormonal changes can impact sleep as people age. ""As we start to move into our 60s, 70s, you have more issues with the depth of your sleep, so your sleep is just lighter in general,"" she said. ""There's sleep disorders, like insomnia, that happens, and then you have to go to the bathroom more at night."" According to to the Sleep Foundation, a group focused on sleep health education, 40-70% of people 65 and older above experience chronic sleep problems. For older women, the hormones estrogen and progesterone start to drop, leading to sleep challenges . ""We have more hot flashes, night sweats. You actually have more sleep apnea in women as well, and just more insomnia too,"" Harris said. There may also be some evolutionary reasoning behind why older adults get less deep sleep, Harris said. ""The deepest stage of sleep is where your muscles are repairing, you're growing — and as you're getting older, you don't need that ideally as much as you do when you're younger,"" she said, adding that younger kids get a lot of deep sleep. ""(Older adults) just wake up a lot more because of pain and movement and having to urinate."" Do adults need less sleep? Harris said it's a myth that older adults don't need a lot of sleep. ""If a doctor tells you that is normal to get a lot less as you get older, definitely seek some other advice,"" Harris said. Some who don't get a full night's rest might supplement with daytime sleep, which is something a lot of older adults do as their days become less structured, she said. Tips for improving sleep as you age In addition to the standard rules for good sleep hygiene , which include a cool, dark, quiet sleep environment and a consistent bedtime routine, there are other ways to support good sleep. If you wake up a lot in the middle of the night, Harris suggests taking time for meditation during the day. ""Because if you have a busy brain, meditating five minutes during the day can help to actually ease your brain more at night,"" she said. To try and get better sleep at night, you can also try spending less time in bed during the day, she said, including reducing naps. And if nothing's working after a few weeks, talk with the doctor, Harris advised. ""We do have a lot of treatments like cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, you might need a sleep study, medication. We have lots of options,"" she said.

He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.

Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of ""TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols."" He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s. Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — ""Little Woman,"" ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me,"" ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" and ""La La La (If I Had You)."" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including ""Here Comes Bobby,"" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10.

Later, he starred in two television series — ""Here Come the Brides"" (1968-70) and ""Getting Together"" (1971). After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work.

Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire . The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs . The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said last week Iran was ""very close to having"" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran ""is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly."" The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but ""pressure has probably built on him to do so"" — noting an ""erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public."" Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes. Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was ""wrong"" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, ""I think they were very close to having one."" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was ""taking my testimony out of context."" The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time. Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes. ""They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,"" Rubio said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."" ""[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,"" she added. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, ""The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making — especially for military combat operations and deployment."" ""The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions —which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,"" Parnell said.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-dept-whistleblower-erez-reuveni-emil-bove/,U.S.,2025-06-24T18:51:05-0400,"Justice Dept. whistleblower details senior officials' efforts to stonewall judges, ignore decisions",12,1318,22,5,"Attorney General Pam Bondi takes questions on Kilmar Abrego Garcia indictment 10:11 An ousted Justice Department attorney told Congress that senior department officials, including a former acting deputy attorney general, discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities, according to a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that ""at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed."" The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases. ""Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,"" the department said in a statement. A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims ""not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.""

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note.

The Danish drugmaker said Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold ""illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies said they were entering a ""long-term collaboration"" to make obesity treatment more accessible. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales. Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using ""knock-off, compounded versions"" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug. This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices. ""After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration."" The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF. In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA. ""U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,"" Novo Nordisk said.

Humans are far from being the only member of the animal kingdom that has mastered using tools. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish for termites, crows create hooked twigs to catch grubs and elephants swat flies with branches. Tool use in the world's difficult-to-study oceans is rarer, however sea otters are known to smash open shellfish with rocks, while octopuses can make mobile homes out of coconut shells. A study published in the journal Current Biology describes a new example of tool use by a critically endangered population of orcas. Scientists have been monitoring the southern resident killer whales in the Salish Sea, between the Canadian province of British Columbia and Washington state, for more than 50 years. Rachel John, a master's student at Exeter University in the U.K., told a press conference that she first noticed ""something kind of weird"" going on while watching drone camera footage last year. The researchers went back over old footage and were surprised to find this behavior is quite common, documenting 30 examples over eight days. One whale would use its teeth to break off a piece of bull kelp, which is strong but flexible like a garden hose. It would then put the kelp between its body and the body of another whale, and they would rub it between them for several minutes. The pair forms an ""S"" shape to keep the seaweed positioned between their bodies as they roll around. ""Skin maintenance behaviors"" Whales are already known to frolic through seaweed in a practice called ""kelping."" They are thought to do this partly for fun, partly to use the seaweed to scrub their bodies to remove dead skin. The international team of researchers called the new behavior ""allokelping,"" which means kelping with another whale. ""We hypothesize that allokelping is similar to skin maintenance behaviors exhibited by other cetaceans,"" the researchers wrote. They found that killer whales with more dead skin were more likely to engage in the activity, cautioning that it was a small sample size. Whales also tended to pair up with family members or others of a similar age, suggesting the activity has a social element. The scientists said it was the first known example of a marine mammal manufacturing a tool. Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University not involved in the study, praised the research but said it ""went a bit too far"" in some of its claims. And it could be argued that other whales known to use nets of bubbles or plumes of mud to hunt represent tool use benefitting multiple individuals, another first claimed in the paper, Mann said. However, the study's authors say allokelping may be the ""first case of non-human animals manipulating a tool with the core of their body rather than an appendage."" Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study's lead author, said it appeared to be just the latest example of socially learned behavior among animals that could be considered ""culture."" But the number of southern resident killer whales has dwindled to just 73, meaning we could soon lose this unique cultural tradition, he warned. ""If they disappear, we're never getting any of that back,"" he said. The whales mainly eat Chinook salmon, whose numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and other forms of human interference. The orcas and salmon are not alone — undersea kelp forests have also been devastated as ocean temperatures rise. Unless something changes, the outlook for southern resident killer whales is ""very bleak,"" Weiss warned. Earlier this year, an unusual spectacle featuring a pod of orcas was also caught on video when onlookers in Seattle were treated to the rare sight of the apex predators hunting a bird close to shore. Killer whales have made headlines for other reasons in recent years. Boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/argentine-court-mistrial-death-soccer-legend-diego-maradona/,Sports,2025-05-29T20:06:51-0400,Argentine court declares mistrial in death of soccer legend Diego Maradona,11,719,13,3,"An Argentine court on Thursday declared a mistrial in the case of seven health professionals accused of negligence in the death of soccer legend Diego Maradona , the latest soap-operatic turn in the trial that has transfixed the soccer world. The judges ruled there would be a new trial, without specifying when. The pivot comes after one of the three judges overseeing the trial stepped down over criticism surrounding her participation in a forthcoming documentary series about the case, ""Divine Justice,"" which spanned from the aftermath of Maradona's death, as scandals and suspicions of foul play began to emerge, to the start of the trial. Diego Maradona coach of Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata looks on during a match between Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata and Velez as part of Superliga 2019/20 at Juan Carmelo Zerillo Stadium on January 24, 2020 in La Plata, Argentina. In calling for the judge, Julieta Makintach, to be recused, the prosecutor on Tuesday presented the trailer for her documentary — a one-and-a-half-minute teaser that intercuts archival footage of Maradona scoring iconic goals with shots of Makintach strutting through the corridors of the Buenos Aires courthouse in high heels and a short skirt as a string soundtrack heightens suspense. The prosecutor asked judges to investigate allegations that Makintach had violated judicial ethics in allowing a camera crew inside the courthouse to film her overseeing closed-door hearings for the reality TV-style series. As the claims snowballed into a national scandal, Makintach on Tuesday said that she had ""no choice"" but to resign from the case. The judges decided on Thursday to retry the entire case, effectively turning the clock back on all proceedings since March 11, when the trial began amid intense media scrutiny and called dozens of distraught witnesses to testify over 21 hearings. ""Judge Makintach did not act impartially. Her conduct caused harm to both the plaintiffs and the defense,"" Judge Maximiliano Savarino said in declaring the mistrial. ""The only person responsible is the recused judge."" He added: ""This is an unpleasant decision."" At the courthouse, two of the soccer star's daughters, Gianinna and Dalma Maradona, began to weep. The decision threw into doubt the timeline of the trial, which was initially expected to last until July. Thursday's ruling said that a higher court would select the three new judges by lottery ""within a reasonable period of time."" The case accuses Maradona's medical team of failing to provide adequate care for the soccer star in weeks leading up to his sudden death on Nov. 25, 2020. Maradona died at age 60 from cardiac arrest while recovering from surgery for a blood clot on the brain at a rented home outside Buenos Aires. Although the case largely hinges on medical technicalities, the biweekly testimonies have also become tabloid fodder — like much in Maradona's life, which included long spates of drug and alcohol abuse. Experts have taken the stand to allege that Maradona agonized for 12 hours before his death, while his sisters and daughters have tearfully accused his medics of leaving him alone in squalor when he should have been hospitalized. The defendants, who deny all accusations, were charged with culpable homicide, a crime similar to involuntary manslaughter in that it implies the accused were aware of the risk caused by their reckless conduct and ignored it. They include Leopoldo Luque, Maradona's primary physician at the time of his death, as well as his psychologist, psychiatrist, medical coordinator and nurses. The crime carries a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison. The defendants say Maradona was a difficult patient who did not allow himself to be treated. Maradona, who famously led Argentina to victory in the 1986 World Cup, is regarded as one of the greatest soccer players of all time. His rags-to-riches story resonated with his fellow Argentines and he is widely revered as a national hero. Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups during his career with Argentina, leading the team to win the 1986 World Cup title against West Germany. He also coached the national team during the 2010 tournament. One of Maradona's most iconic moments as a player was during the 1986 championship run in Mexico City. Maradona scored a goal in a quarterfinal match against England by lightly using his fist, out of the referees' view. He described the goal as ""the hand of God.""

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops. The Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible. Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:11:59.010550

The student, AB Hernandez, a transgender 16-year-old, won both the high school girls' high jump and triple jump at a California state track meet on Saturday, after competing under new rules that allowed more girls to compete and medal in events in which Hernandez participated. Before the competition, California Interscholastic Foundation, the independent non-profit organization that runs the state's high school sports, started a ""pilot entry process"" that allowed additional female students to participate in the championship meet. The new rules also resulted in Hernandez sharing the gold medal podium with two other students in a shared first place win in one event . The new policy only applied to events that Hernandez participated in. However, in a letter sent Monday to California public school districts and the CIF, Harmeet Dhillon, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, called CIF policies allowing transgender athletes to compete ""unconstitutional."" She alleged that ""knowingly depriving female students of athletic opportunities and benefits on the basis of their sex would constitute unconstitutional sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause"" of the 14th Amendment. Dhillon ordered the CIF to inform the Justice Department by June 9 that it will no longer implement a bylaw covering transgender athletes, alleging it violates the rights of female athletes. The CIF rule criticized by Dhillon's letter requires California public high schools to allow all students to participate in sports ""in a manner that is consistent with their gender identities, irrespective of the gender listed on a student's records."" The letter does not mention Hernandez. But on Tuesday morning, President Trump singled out Hernandez in a post on Truth Social , his social media site, and said that ""large scale fines"" will be imposed on the state. Last week, Bill Essayli, the acting top federal prosecutor in the Central District of California, also said he was launching an investigation into the foundation. In an interview with the news outlet Capital & Main, Hernandez said that she is not worried about the criticism, both national and local, aimed at her. ""I'm still a child, you're an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,"" Hernandez told the publication. A spokesperson for California Attorney General Rob Bonta said that the office is ""reviewing the letter and closely monitoring the Trump Administration's actions in this space."" ""We're very concerned with the Trump Administration's ongoing threats to California schools and remain committed to defending and upholding California laws and all additional laws which ensure the rights of students — including transgender students — to be free from discrimination and harassment,"" the spokesperson said. A spokesperson for the CIF did not respond to immediate requests for comment. Last month, the Justice Department announced that it was investigating California high school sports after it allowed the student to compete at the track and field championships. The Trump administration has already sued Maine over what it alleges is a violation of an executive order attempting to ban transgender women and girls from women's sports. Earlier this year, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter to California warning of legal action if the state does not follow federal civil rights laws following Mr. Trump's executive order in February opposing transgender athletes .

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.

As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations.

But what green flags, or positive traits, should singles be on the lookout for? Frankie Bashan, known as Dr. Frankie, is a clinical psychologist, board-certified sex therapist, founder of Little Gay Book and relationship expert with over 20 years of experience. She said shifting your focus from red flags to green flags can lead to more successful dating. ""You want to be looking for all this from the outset,"" she said. ""Because we're wired for survival, what do we notice? We notice the orange and red flags right away, and it often scares us, so we foreclose opportunities."" Instead, she encourages people to suspend immediate judgment and be curious. ""I'm noticing this, but I'm not going to make a definitive answer just yet. Right now, I'm just taking in information,"" she advised thinking. ""Our brains don't do it automatically. It has to be intentional."" Here are some green flags to look for. Reliability While showing up late or canceling a date last-minute may be a red flag, doing the opposite is a green flag. ""Do they commit to a date? Do they show up on time?"" Bashan said of indications someone is reliable. Trustworthiness As they share information about themselves, Bashan said you want to see if they're consistent in their stories. ""Figure out, is this somebody that is trustworthy?"" she said. Values relationships Having and valuing relationships outside of a romantic partner — like friends and family — is another green flag, according to Bashan. ""Is this person somebody who can have sustainable, long term relationships?"" she said. ""Not everybody has family that they're close to for one reason or another, but do they have chosen family? Do they have friendships that they value and that are important to them, that they invest in?"" Reciprocity Someone who's not afraid to let you know that they're interested is another green flag. ""When you're sharing about yourself, your interests, your desires for relationships, what you're looking for — they're listening,"" Bashan said. ""They're not just waiting for you to finish so that they can give a response and focusing on how they want to respond to everything. No, they're actually attentive, focused, curious about you."" Boundaries Being able to set (and respect!) boundaries is another green flag, according to Wendy Walsh, a relationship expert at the website DatingAdvice and psychology professor with a doctorate in clinical psychology. ""There's been some talk on social media about people who trauma dump on dates,"" she said, explaining this isn't the way to go. ""They think they're being open, authentic and vulnerable, but what they're really doing is disclosing too much, too soon."" Or, if your date asks you something you're uncomfortable answering on a first encounter, take note of how they respond to you setting a boundary of not sharing that part of yourself just yet. Balance of dependance A relationship is about growing both together and independently, and Walsh said it's a green flag when someone understands and demonstrates and appropriate balance. Picture a Venn diagram with the circles representing the individuals and the overlapped area representing the relationship. ""Relationships are unhealthy when the two circles completely overlap. Psychologists would call that the enmeshed. They're so enmeshed that nobody can remember whose problem is whose, and they start to control each other, and what ends up happening is the individual starts to die,"" she said. ""Now picture the two circles right beside each other, but not overlapping. And now you have individual growth, but you have no relationship security.""",2025-06-24T17:12:04.086708

The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that ""at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed."" The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases. ""Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,"" the department said in a statement. A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims ""not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.""

The Danish drugmaker said Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold ""illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies said they were entering a ""long-term collaboration"" to make obesity treatment more accessible. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales. Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using ""knock-off, compounded versions"" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug. This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices. ""After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration."" The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF. In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA. ""U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,"" Novo Nordisk said. Novo Nordisk will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms that ""share our commitment to patient safety,"" said Dave Moore, executive vice president at Novo Nordisk, in the company's statement .

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety. While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings. In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse. In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head."" According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America. This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire . On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities."" Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back."" She added, ""We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Iran",2025-06-24T17:12:13.898445

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. First Responders look at destruction caused by an Iranian missile strike in Beersheba, southern Israel, June 24, 2025. Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: ""ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran.

Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport. There were no reports of casualties, and no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. War Iran Israel Nuclear Weapons Cease-fire Donald Trump",2025-06-24T17:12:17.140329
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-cbs-news-opinion-poll/,Sports,2025-06-24T17:58:09-0400,"Poll finds U.S. strikes on Iran backed by Republicans, disapproval overall; most say Trump needs Congress' OK",17,637,23,6,"Details on canceled security briefings over Trump's Iran strikes 03:30 As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities , at least three things are in play. One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:12:18.772481

The MIND diet stands for ""Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay"" and combines many elements of the Mediterranean diet and DASH (""Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension""). It emphasizes brain-healthy foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts and olive oil. The study, being presented Monday at the American Society for Nutrition's annual meeting , analyzed data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults aged 45 to 75 starting in the 1990s. Participants who closely followed a MIND diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia compared to those with low adherence to the diet. Those who improved their adherence to the diet over 10 years, including those who didn't follow the diet closely at first, had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared to those whose adherence declined. ""Our study findings confirm that healthy dietary patterns in mid to late life and their improvement over time may prevent Alzheimer's and related dementias,"" Song-Yi Park, an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, said in a news release . ""This suggests that it is never too late to adopt a healthy diet to prevent dementia."" An estimated 7.2 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's, the most common form of dementia, according to the Alzheimer's Association. This study joins previous research that has highlighted the benefits of eating a plant-focused diet to prevent the progressive brain disorder. A 2023 study published in the online issue of Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, found that people who follow the Mediterranean or MIND diets may have fewer signs of Alzheimer's disease in their brain tissue.

In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material. Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was ""quintessentially transformative"" and did not violate ""fair use"" doctrine under copyright law. ""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,"" his decision states. By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles. Authors had filed suit Anthropic cheered the ruling. The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to ""large-scale theft."" The authors also alleged that Anthropic ""seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works."" The authors' attorneys declined comment. Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots. At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

The Danish drugmaker said Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold ""illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies said they were entering a ""long-term collaboration"" to make obesity treatment more accessible. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales. Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using ""knock-off, compounded versions"" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug. This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices. ""After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration."" The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF. In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA. ""U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,"" Novo Nordisk said.

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.

Now retired from NASA, Whitson is America's most experienced astronaut with three ISS missions and an earlier Axiom commercial flight to her credit. NASA Going into the Ax-4 flight, Whitson had logged 675 days in space across three NASA flights and one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space. As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-recommendations-measure-obesity-bmi/,Health,2025-01-15T12:32:21-0500,New recommendations to measure obesity go beyond controversial BMI. A doctor explains.,12,537,21,6,"New recommendations to measure obesity 03:26 Body mass index , or BMI, has long been criticized as a flawed method for measuring obesity — and now a group of experts is sharing new recommendations. BMI is a formula that uses a person's height and weight ratio to assess whether they're underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese, although it is not a direct measure of body fat. In the report, published Tuesday in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal , more than 50 experts proposed a new way for medical professionals to define and diagnose obesity that puts less emphasis on BMI. ""So what that means is, do you actually have excess fat?"" Gounder said, explaining there are three main ways to measure that. 1. Waist circumference, or a waist to hip ratio: ""So if your waist is over 35 inches for a woman or 40 inches for a man, that means you do have excess fat, or are you apple-shaped versus pear-shaped?"" Gounder said. 2. Directly measuring body fat: ""Some older women might be familiar with a DEXA test to assess for bone thinning or osteoporosis. That can also be used to measure body fat,"" Gounder said. 3. Effects on your daily living activities: ""Can you climb up and down stairs? If you're not able to because of your weight, that would be clinically obese,"" she said. ""Do you see damage to your organs, your kidneys, your heart, et cetera because of your obesity? That would be clinical obesity."" The updated recommendations were endorsed by 76 organizations worldwide, including scientific societies and patient advocacy groups, the authors of the report said, though it's not clear how widely or quickly they could be put into practice. The report acknowledges that shifting to these recommendations will bring both cost and workforce challenges. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , BMI is an ""inexpensive and easy screening method"" that is ""strongly correlated"" with weight-related medical conditions. But in recent years, BMI has come increasingly under fire with critics denouncing the method as not just unreliable but sexist and racist . ""BMI is really looking at how much do you weigh relative to your height. But not every, say, six foot man who has the same weight is obese versus healthy. Some of them may actually be strapping, muscular guys versus somebody who is truly overweight or obese. So we're trying to distinguish between this,"" Gounder said. For example, many professional athletes are considered clinically obese based on the BMI scale, because it cannot distinguish the weight of muscle from the weight of fat.

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead.

When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be ""helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks."" The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program. In response to the strikes, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties. The attack came after Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran. Israeli officials have said at least 28 people in Israel have died in Iran's missile attacks. A ceasefire announced by President Trump between Israel and Iran appears to be holding on Tuesday, with the two sides halting their exchange of fire after 12 days.

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety. While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings. In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse. In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head."" According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America. This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire . On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities."" Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back."" She added, ""We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Iran",2025-06-24T17:12:38.652792

Video shows the explosion, which SpaceX said occurred as the Starship was preparing for an engine test firing. The Starship ""experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" the company said in a post on X . ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,"" SpaceX said. The company said there are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities and asked that people avoid the area ""while safing operations continue."" Video from LabPadre, the company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, appears to show two major explosions — the first near the rocket's nose, and the second on the left side of the spacecraft. The Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and high-energy methane fuel at the time the detonations happened. The explosion may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday. Starship is comprised of a spacecraft and a Super Heavy rocket that together are intended to be a reusable system that can carry cargo and crew to the moon and Mars. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch astronauts on a mission to land near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights over the last two years, with the first three ending with explosions or breakups and the next three being partially successful. The next two resulted in explosions and the most recent flight, in May, reached its trajectory but broke up during atmospheric entry after spinning out of control. Known as Ship 36, SpaceX was planning to launch the Starship around the end of this month on a huge Super Heavy booster, in what would have been the rocket's 10th test fight.

One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:12:41.979797

The dinosaur's identity was unknown — until now. In a study published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex , eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said. Darla Zelenitsky, associate professor of dinosaur paleontology and principal dinosaur researcher in the Department of Geoscience, and Jared Voris, post-doctoral scholar, published a paper in the science journal ""Nature"" about the evolution of the Tyrannosaurus. Riley Brandt, University of Calgary The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years. Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time. ""It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,"" Zelenitsky said. A surprise discovery University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu. Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus. ""This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,"" Voris said. He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he ""thought it could be a new species."" Zelenitsky said she responded, ""I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species."" An artist rendering of a new tyrannosauroid named ""Khankhuuluu."" Image: Julius Csotonyi The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries — they've had several. In 2023 , Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum — whose genus name translates to ""Reaper of Death."" ""Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs"" These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America. And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the deadliest land predator ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.

Image credit: Jared Voris The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science.

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops.

Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:12:45.694506

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one.""

The federal statistics show nearly half — or 47% — of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation. ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses — while the agency attempts to deport them. As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers. Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day. The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees. ""If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system. The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows. Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office. ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records. But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana . It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress. Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds. Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Florida would receive federal funds to set up those facilities. Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity. In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a ""massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States"" has led to ""a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity."" ""ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,"" ICE added, noting the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds. Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population. ""I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants — both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,"" Kocher said.

The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be ""helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks."" The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program. In response to the strikes, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties. The attack came after Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran. Israeli officials have said at least 28 people in Israel have died in Iran's missile attacks. A ceasefire announced by President Trump between Israel and Iran appears to be holding on Tuesday, with the two sides halting their exchange of fire after 12 days.

The Danish drugmaker said Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold ""illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies said they were entering a ""long-term collaboration"" to make obesity treatment more accessible. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales. Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using ""knock-off, compounded versions"" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug. This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices. ""After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration."" The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF. In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA. ""U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,"" Novo Nordisk said. Novo Nordisk will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms that ""share our commitment to patient safety,"" said Dave Moore, executive vice president at Novo Nordisk, in the company's statement .

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. First Responders look at destruction caused by an Iranian missile strike in Beersheba, southern Israel, June 24, 2025. Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: ""ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.""

Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport. There were no reports of casualties, and no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks. War Iran Israel Nuclear Weapons Cease-fire Donald Trump",2025-06-24T17:13:01.342028

The federal statistics show nearly half — or 47% — of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation. ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses — while the agency attempts to deport them. As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers. Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day. The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees. ""If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system.

That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death. ""It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,"" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022. Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances . Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire. Why a ""mini-retirement"" is becoming a popular trend among young workers 03:26 ""Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,"" said LaVigne. Tough time to save money Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses is still rising , making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement. Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said. Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency. LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. ""You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,"" he said.

Here's how long it will last.",21,927,20,10,"How to handle the dangerous heat wave scorching the Northeast 02:00 The worst heat is likely to peak for cities in the Northeast on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. ""A large portion of the region will see high temperatures ranging between 98 and 101 degrees,"" the agency said , with ""numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures"" expected through at least Wednesday. ""Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,"" the weather service warned. A key measurement of the strength of the ridge of high pressure broke a record Monday , according to the NWS. It was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. More than 160 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rose to about 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain. Map shows areas under a heat alert Tuesday, June 24. Here's what to know about the heat wave and how to stay safe. Heat wave forecast maps ""Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming in HOT,"" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings ""with oppressive humidity."" The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity. Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. The heat index in Philadelphia topped out at 108 on Monday. Meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome — an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity — sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality. The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say. ""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said. These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures. High temperature forecast for Tuesday, June 24. High temperature forecast for Wednesday, June 25. How long will the heat wave last? The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday. Parts of the Northeast face a ""High Risk"" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. ""The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon."" What constitutes a heat wave? A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly. Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down. ""Your body needs a reprieve,"" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. ""You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit."" When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, ""You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality."" Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S. How to stay safe during a heat wave Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended . You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty. It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say .

Studies have also shown stretching can help patients dealing with chronic insomnia . ""The mind is racing around, the body is tired, but the two things don't seem to be able to communicate well enough with each other to just chill out and sleep,"" he said.

Stretching before bed also offers a time to check in with how we feel, Pasle-Green added, something we might not get the opportunity to do throughout our day. 6 stretching exercises to help you fall asleep 1. Forward fold: Whether standing with wide legs or sitting with your legs out in front of you, fold forward at your hips, creating a stretch. ""Oftentimes, any pose that incorporates or stretch that incorporates folding forwards can be really soothing for the system,"" Kelleher said, adding the physical sensation you feel during the stretch can give your mind something to focus on. ""We're not kind of worried about emails or what's coming next, or whatever the next steps in the evening routine are. We're just having an experience,"" he said, adding to incorporate a few deep breaths in this posture. 2. Seated ankle cross: While sitting on a bed, chair or couch, place one ankle on the opposite leg, as high as available, Pasle-Green explains, then lean forward with a long spine to move the chest as close to the top leg as is comfortable. Hold for three deep breaths then switch legs and repeat as desired, she said. Side view of a senior woman sitting relaxed in yoga exercise to stretch the back 3. Chest opener: Sit tall and place your hands behind you on the bed or couch, fingers pointing away from you. ""Let your head relax back, opening your chest and front of your neck,"" Pasle-Green said. ""To increase the stretch, you can finger-walk your hands further back or roll your head slightly side to side."" Hold this for three deep breaths. 4. Side stretch: While seated, place your right hand to your right and slide it away from you as you lean to the right, opening up your left side. You can also reach your left arm over your head and reaching it toward the right, Pasle-Green said. ""Breathe deeply throughout this stretch, keeping your body and your breath moving the whole time,"" she said, adding to repeat on each side. Side stretching on the floor. 5. Hug stretch: While seated, wrap your arms around your rib cage in a big hug with each hand on the opposite side shoulder blade. ""Take a big breath in, and as you exhale, drop your chin toward your chest and round your spine forward as far as you can, pressing your bottom elbow toward your belly button,"" Pasle-Green said, adding to repeat while switching which arm is on top. 6. Twist pose: While laying on your back, hug your knees into your chest. ""Then drop both knees off to one side while you open up your arms nice and wide right and create some lateral flexion in the spine and a feeling of twist,"" Kelleher said. From this position, drop both knees off to one side while you opening your arms for a gentle spine twist. PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou While any of these stretches can offer benefits throughout the day, Pasle-Green said they are most effective during the transition from activity to rest. ""By intentionally relaxing the body and mind right before sleep, our most impactful span of rest, we get a greater return on the time invested by greatly enhancing the quality of that rest,"" she said.

The Danish drugmaker said Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold ""illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies said they were entering a ""long-term collaboration"" to make obesity treatment more accessible. Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement. Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales. Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using ""knock-off, compounded versions"" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug. This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices. ""After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,"" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. ""This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration."" The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF. In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA. ""U.S. patients should not be exposed to knock-off drugs made with unsafe and illicit foreign ingredients,"" Novo Nordisk said.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/plastic-bag-bans-fees-curbs-litter-study-says/,Sports,2025-06-19T15:57:00-0400,Do plastic bag bans and fees work? A new study says policies curb litter – by a lot,18,609,15,7,"Plastic bag regulations have led to significant decrease in shoreline litter, study finds 03:37 State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines — potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found. More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes – and if they did, to what extent. Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations. ""When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,"" Oremus said in a statement. ""And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy."" These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments . Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. A plastic bag on the banks of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 2019. Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own. Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed ""single use"" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered ""reusable"" under partial bans, ""there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use."" In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide ""preemption"" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all. During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said. ""Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting—but not eliminating—shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,"" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.

The federal statistics show nearly half — or 47% — of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation. ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses — while the agency attempts to deport them. As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers. Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day. The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees. ""If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system. The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows. Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office. ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records. But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana . It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress. Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds. Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Florida would receive federal funds to set up those facilities. Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity. In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a ""massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States"" has led to ""a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity."" ""ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,"" ICE added, noting the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds. Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population. ""I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants — both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,"" Kocher said.

On his way to The Hague on Tuesday, Mr. Trump called on lawmakers to stay in Washington until they can resolve their issues and get the bill — which extends the president's 2017 tax cuts and includes much of his second-term agenda — to his desk. ""NO ONE GOES ON VACATION UNTIL IT'S DONE,"" he wrote on Truth Social . The last scheduled day in session for both chambers before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving them with little time to reach their goal. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who met with Senate Republicans Tuesday, told reporters after the meeting that they're ""on track"" for a vote Friday on the bill, adding that he expects it can get to the president's desk by July 4. Still, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, threatened to keep senators in Washington over the recess as several Republicans cast doubt about the upper chamber's ability to finish their work before the deadline. Thune told reporters Monday that the Senate is ""on schedule"" to vote by the end of the week. Senate Majority Leader John Thune leaves the Senate Republicans' lunch in the U.S. Capitol on June 24, 2025. The bill, named the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, narrowly passed the House last month, but Senate Republicans are making changes in order to navigate the party's tight 53-47 margin in the upper chamber. On Tuesday, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he told House Republicans to ""keep your schedules flexible"" as the Senate looks to send the legislation back to the lower chamber for approval. The Louisiana Republican predicted the Senate could pass the bill by Friday or Saturday. The timing of a House vote would eat into next week's recess. ""There's nothing more important that we should be involved in and can be involved in than getting the one big, beautiful bill to the president's desk,"" Johnson said at his weekly news conference. Parliamentarian rulings Days before an expected vote, the Senate's final version has yet to come together. The Senate's rulekeeper has been looking through the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate the upper chamber's rules. The Senate parliamentarian advised that several controversial provisions would violate the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending, according to Senate Budget Committee Democrats. Provisions that did not make the cut are subject to a 60-vote threshold, compared with the 51 votes needed under the reconciliation process. Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court. The provision limited the ability of federal courts to delay or halt the government's policies by requiring people suing the federal government to post a bond to cover the potential costs and damages incurred by the government. The parliamentarian determined that a provision to bar immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, should also be removed. The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal championed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands. Other provisions struck from the bill include the sale of electric vehicles used by the United States Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for ""sanctuary cities"" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement. But the parliamentarian did allow Republicans to keep a 10-year moratorium on state laws regulating artificial intelligence. SALT sticking points As the Senate lurches toward a vote on the bill, disagreement over the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, has persisted. But Bessent said Tuesday afternoon that he expected a solution on what's become one of the biggest sticking points will be reached in the next 24 to 48 hours. While the House measure increases the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000, the Senate Finance Committee's version that was unveiled last week proposes permanently extending the $10,000 cap. The chasm sparked pushback among blue-state House Republicans, who have threatened to withhold their support should the Senate approve the changes and send it back to the House. Republican Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who formerly served in the House and has worked as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters Monday that ""neither side is going to love where we're at, but it's going to be acceptable."" ""The Senate wants to go further to the right and the SALT caucus wants to go further to the left,"" Mullin said. ""We're going to find, I think, hopefully some place right in the middle that both sides can live with."" Medicaid and the provider tax Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes — which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs — from 6% to 3.5% by 2031, after the House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. But the move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House. A group of 16 House Republicans penned a letter to Thune and Johnson Tuesday opposing the Senate's changes to the House-passed legislation on Medicaid. The moderates argued that the House approach ""reflects a more pragmatic and compassionate standard,"" pointing in particular to the provisions restricting the provider tax within the Senate legislation. Sen. Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, has voiced opposition to the provider tax changes, and said more senators spoke up at Tuesday's lunch against the Senate's provider tax proposal. Fiscal hawks speak out Another faction in Congress has voiced opposition to the spending levels in the legislation, advocating for deeper cuts that have often worked counter to leadership's efforts to appease other members of their conferences. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus who initially threatened to withhold their support for the House-passed legislation have suggested they would tank the Senate's changes to the bill. And a number of Senate Republicans have voiced strong opposition to the legislation's impact on the deficit. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida was among a handful of Senate Republicans who met with Mr. Trump on Monday amid opposition from fiscal hawks. Despite the disagreements, he told reporters that ""I'm the eternal optimist that we're going to figure this out.""",2025-06-24T17:13:18.337551

Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim. Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, retired from NASA in 2018 and now works for Axiom.

Now retired from NASA, Whitson is America's most experienced astronaut with three ISS missions and an earlier Axiom commercial flight to her credit. NASA Going into the Ax-4 flight, Whitson had logged 675 days in space across three NASA flights and one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space. As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission ""opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.""

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one."" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",2025-06-24T17:13:23.342929

The 32-year-old from Seattle was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, according to a statement from the Bureau of Prisons. Responding employees initiated life-saving measures, and emergency medical services transported Park to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, the bureau said. His cause of death wasn't immediately clear, and the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service have been notified. No employees or other incarcerated individuals were injured, the bureau said. Park, a U.S. citizen, had arrived at the L.A. detention center on June 13, after he was indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property. He was apprehended in Poland earlier this month after flying to Warsaw a few days after the bombing outside American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic on May 17 . He was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate — commonly used as a precursor to construct homemade explosives — to the bomber, who was identified by officials as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus. Bartkus died in the blast outside the fertility clinic. ""Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,"" Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said at a news briefing after the blast. Prosecutors said evidence showed that Park and Bartkus shared nihilist beliefs. The criminal complaint filed against Park alleged the attack ""was motivated by his pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology, which is the belief that individuals should not be born without their consent and that non-existence is best.""

The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption. This image from video shows a SpaceX Starship upper stage exploding at the Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, June 18, 2025. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV. But the company said there is ""no commonality"" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship. ""Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,"" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. ""If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design."" The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week. Such ""hotfire"" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th ""integrated flight test."" But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing. The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast. Flames rise as a SpaceX rocket explodes ahead of an engine test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, June 18, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted. ""On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" SpaceX said in a statement on X. ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. ""There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area."" What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known. NASA counting on Starship for moon mission SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages. The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. It will not be easy. To get the Human Landing System — HLS — Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a ""depot"" Starship, undock, and return to Earth. The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule. SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon. NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement. While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that ""NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions."" ""We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission."" Elon Musk SpaceX",2025-06-24T17:13:26.579002

One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:13:28.195987

Here's how long it will last.",21,927,20,10,"How to handle the dangerous heat wave scorching the Northeast 02:00 The worst heat is likely to peak for cities in the Northeast on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. ""A large portion of the region will see high temperatures ranging between 98 and 101 degrees,"" the agency said , with ""numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures"" expected through at least Wednesday. ""Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,"" the weather service warned. A key measurement of the strength of the ridge of high pressure broke a record Monday , according to the NWS. It was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. More than 160 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rose to about 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain. Map shows areas under a heat alert Tuesday, June 24. Here's what to know about the heat wave and how to stay safe. Heat wave forecast maps ""Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming in HOT,"" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings ""with oppressive humidity."" The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity. Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. The heat index in Philadelphia topped out at 108 on Monday. Meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome — an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity — sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality. The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say. ""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said. These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures. High temperature forecast for Tuesday, June 24. High temperature forecast for Wednesday, June 25. How long will the heat wave last? The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday. Parts of the Northeast face a ""High Risk"" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. ""The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon."" What constitutes a heat wave? A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly. Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down. ""Your body needs a reprieve,"" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. ""You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit."" When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, ""You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality."" Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S. How to stay safe during a heat wave Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended . You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty. It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say .

Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.

Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed ""single use"" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered ""reusable"" under partial bans, ""there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use."" In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide ""preemption"" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all. During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said.

Explosions were heard in Qatar, multiple news agencies reported, and photos showed missiles over Qatar's capital city, Doha. U.S. and Qatari authorities said the missiles were intercepted and no one was injured. President Trump has indicated that the U.S. was given prior warning of the Iranian strike. U.S. Central Command said , ""U.S. forces, alongside our Qatari partners, successfully defended against an Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting Qatar's Al-Udeid Air Base near Doha, Qatar,"" using ""U.S. and Qatari Patriot batteries."" Mr. Trump called the attack by Iran ""a very weak response"" that the U.S. expected and ""very effectively countered."" He said in a pair of social media posts that 14 missiles were fired, and no Americans or Qataris were harmed. ""Most importantly, they've gotten it all out of their 'system,' and there will, hopefully, be no further HATE,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""I want to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost, and nobody to be injured. Perhaps Iran can now proceed to Peace and Harmony in the Region, and I will enthusiastically encourage Israel to do the same."" Interceptor missiles are fired after Iran's armed forces say they targeted the Al Udeid base in a missile attack, as seen from Doha, Qatar, June 23, 2025. Stringer / REUTERS The president extended gratitude to Qatar's Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani ""for all that he has done in seeking Peace for the Region."" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, wrote in a post on X: ""We didn't harm anyone. And we will not accept any harassment from anyone under any circumstances. And we will not submit to anyone's harassment; This is the logic of the Iranian nation,"" according to an automated translation. The message was accompanied by an illustration of a burning and tattered American flag on a wrecked military base. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said it targeted the U.S. base at Al Udeid in Qatar with a ""devastating and powerful missile."" Iranian state media earlier announced an operation launching missile attacks against U.S. bases named ""Annunciation of Victory."" A U.S. defense official confirmed that the base was attacked by short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles originating from Iran. Map shows location of the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. The Qatari government said its air defenses ""thwarted the attack and successfully intercepted the Iranian missiles."" ""The State of Qatar strongly condemns the attack that targeted Al-Udeid Air Base by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. We consider this a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the State of Qatar, its airspace, international law, and the United Nations Charter,"" a spokesperson for the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement shared on social media. ""We affirm that Qatar reserves the right to respond directly in a manner equivalent with the nature and scale of this brazen aggression, in line with international law."" Al Udeid Air Base is southwest of Doha and serves as the forward headquarters for CENTCOM. Thousands of U.S. troops are based there. Earlier Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Qatar warned Americans to shelter in place ""until further notice."" The shelter-in-place order has now been lifted . Qatar's foreign ministry said the country was closing its airspace ""to ensure the safety of citizens, residents, and visitors."" Air raid sirens also sounded in Bahrain, which announced the temporary closure of its airspace on Monday. Bahrain is home to a U.S. naval base that serves as the headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet. An estimated 9,000 service members are stationed there. Bahrain's Ministry of Interior urged people to ""remain calm and head to the nearest safe place,"" adding that they should ""seek shelter in the nearest building or take cover in a safe, enclosed area until the danger has passed."" U.S. and Qatari officials had meetings over the weekend and Monday morning to prepare for this attack, according to diplomatic sources, who said the retaliation was expected and calibrated. The U.S. has about 45,000 military personnel, numerous bases and air and naval fleets that it can deploy across the Middle East. The U.S. bombed three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. It came after more than a week of Israeli attacks on Iranian targets and Iranian strikes on Israel. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said Sunday that the U.S. had ""practically placed itself at the forefront of aggression by directly attacking peaceful facilities."" It alluded to plans to attack U.S. assets in the Middle East, saying ""the number, dispersion, and size of U.S. military bases in the region are not a strength, but have doubled their vulnerability."" All U.S. House and Senate members are expected to receive classified briefings Wednesday on Iran and the U.S. military response. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters Monday that Mr. Trump ""made an evaluation that the danger was imminent enough to take his authority as commander in chief and make that decision."" Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, questioned the president's actions, saying in a letter to House Democrats that Mr. Trump has ""not presented any evidence to Congress that Iran posed an imminent threat that required immediate and offensive military action."" ""The use of military force, which is offensive in nature, must be approved by the House and the Senate,"" Jeffries told reporters in a news conference on Capitol Hill Monday afternoon. ""That's according to the Constitution. It's not optional, Donald. It's not."" Iran's retaliatory strike bolstered calls from some lawmakers for Congress to intervene and assert congressional authority. Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who introduced a resolution last week aimed at stopping U.S. strikes, reiterated Monday his belief that the War Powers Act requires the president to withdraw from hostilities in Iran within 60 days. ""Whether you like it or not Congress will be voting on U.S. hostilities in Iran,"" Massie wrote on social media , noting that 57 lawmakers have signed onto his resolution.

Economists and other experts say consumers can expect to see higher prices for imported items targeted by the latest round of tariffs in the coming weeks and months. Groceries Perhaps the most impacted day-to-day purchases for American families will be at the grocery store, where a large share of our most commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico, Canada, China and other countries facing tariffs. Experts suggest the cost of those tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the grocery checkout lane. We examined the prices for fruits, vegetables and juices that are primarily imported from other countries, according to USDA data. The average prices are drawn from weekly surveys that the Agriculture Department conducts at hundreds of stores across the country. We've tracked the weekly price data from 2020 through last week. Cars and trucks The cost of owning and operating a car or truck in the United States is a major focus ahead of the threatened White House tariffs on vehicles manufactured in other countries — a change experts predict will add thousands more to the cost of ownership, parts, repairs and insurance. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, supply-chain interruptions and the inflation that followed, the price of buying new and used cars rose sharply. So did the cost of parts, repairs and insurance. The charts show the price as an index — the percentage above a baseline. For new and used vehicles, we're using an example of a small SUV to translate the percentages into dollars to explain the recent years' change. Used car prices spiked after the COVID pandemic because major supply chain disruptions and a global computer chip shortage severely slowed down new vehicle production. In some cases, late-model used vehicle prices soared to nearly the same as new models of the same or similar vehicles. Some of the same phenomenon drove up the price of auto parts, and consequently, consumers' bills at repair shops. In addition to the rising cost of repairs, labor shortages, driving habits and increasing crash trends have driven up the cost of automobile insurance premiums, aggravating the total cost of owning and operating personal cars and trucks. Construction and manufacturing supplies Baked into the cost of everything from homebuilding to the manufacture of durable goods like appliances are the cost of core supplies like steel and aluminum , which are also targeted by the administration's tariffs.

The federal statistics show nearly half — or 47% — of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation. ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses — while the agency attempts to deport them. As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers. Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day. The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees. ""If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system. The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows. Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office. ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records. But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana . It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress. Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds. Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Florida would receive federal funds to set up those facilities. Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity. In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a ""massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States"" has led to ""a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity."" ""ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,"" ICE added, noting the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds. Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population. ""I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants — both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,"" Kocher said.

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note.

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

Similar assessments were made in the days leading up to the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, and in the days afterward. The U.S. airstrikes came amid a wider dayslong Israeli offensive against Iranian nuclear facilities, though Mr. Trump announced Monday that Iran and Israel had agreed to a ceasefire . The intelligence summary also found that Iranian officials had discussed moving canisters of highly enriched uranium into car trunks and storing them in public parking lots to avoid destruction. Iran has increased its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium in recent months, sparking concerns among both Iran's adversaries and international watchdogs . The country has enriched uranium up to 60% purity, which is only a short step away from the 90% level generally used in nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump said last week Iran was ""very close to having"" a nuclear weapon, and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Iran ""is at the point that it can produce a nuclear weapon within weeks to months, if they decide to finalize the assembly."" The head of U.S. Central Command, Gen. Michael Kurilla, testified in mid-June that if Iran were to decide to sprint to a nuclear weapon, it would be able to produce enough weapons-grade material for a simple nuclear weapon in one week and could make enough for 10 nuclear weapons in three weeks. U.S. intelligence officials have said for years that Iran formally halted its nuclear weapons development program in 2003. In March, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, still had not reauthorized the program, but ""pressure has probably built on him to do so"" — noting an ""erosion of a decades-long taboo on discussing nuclear weapons in public."" Different agencies in the intelligence community may have their own assessments about what Iran's nuclear capabilities were prior to the strikes. Gabbard reiterated that assessment in testimony to Congress earlier this year. But last week, Mr. Trump told reporters Gabbard was ""wrong"" about whether Iran was building a nuclear weapon, later adding, ""I think they were very close to having one."" Gabbard later said she and the president were on the same page, and the media was ""taking my testimony out of context."" The U.S. airstrikes targeted two Iranian uranium enrichment facilities and a nuclear research site, following a dayslong air campaign by Israel, which has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" The impact of the weekend strikes by the U.S. is still not clear; the Pentagon offered a preliminary public assessment of the damage soon after the strikes. ""Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Sunday, adding that a full assessment would take time. Iran, for its part, has long denied that it intends to build nuclear weapons, and insists its uranium enrichment program is meant for peaceful purposes. ""They have everything they need to build nuclear weapons,"" Rubio said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement, ""President Trump and the administration have always been right to say that if Iran chose to make a nuclear bomb, they could do so within weeks, which obviously poses an imminent threat to the US and the world."" ""[T]hanks to President Trump's strong leadership and the incredibly successful military strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, their capacity to build a nuclear bomb has been obliterated and the world can sleep easy at night,"" she added. Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement, ""The Department of Defense routinely provides resources and assessments for leaders at all levels to consider in their decision-making — especially for military combat operations and deployment."" ""The classified intelligence report unlawfully leaked to CBS does not paint a holistic picture of Iran's nuclear ambitions —which many in the national security community assessed could occur within weeks,"" Parnell said. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred any questions to the Defense Department. Iran Israel Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:13:43.487283

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note.

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

Honda, which hopes to develop the tech prowess for a suborbital launch by 2029, conducted a test flight of its rocket on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. ""The test was completed successfully, the first time Honda landed a rocket after reaching an altitude of nearly 300 meters (about 984 feet),"" the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Honda's experimental reusable rocket is seen during what the company said was its successful test launch from the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido on on June 17, 2025. Honda R&D Co. Ltd. The prototype device, around six meters (20 feet) tall, landed only 37 centimeters (a little more than a foot) from its designated landing spot after the one-minute flight. Demand for satellite launch rockets is expected to increase in coming years as expectations grow for ""a data system in outer space,"" the Honda statement said. ""Honda has chosen to take on the technological challenge of developing reusable rockets by utilizing Honda technologies amassed in the development of various products and automated driving systems,"" it said. In the future, the rockets could be used to set up satellite-based communication tools and monitor environmental conditions such as global warming, Honda added. Elon Musk's SpaceX is known for its use of reusable rockets -- a fast-growing field with various companies worldwide racing to develop their own models. Japan's space agency, JAXA, is also on a mission to become a major player for satellite launches, including with its H3 rocket, which isn't reusable. Meanwhile, Japanese startups are vying to enter the busy field, including Space One, which in December suffered its second failed rocket launch. Honda Space",2025-06-24T17:13:48.393677
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/micro-cheating-relationship-advice/,Health,2025-03-12T08:54:00-0400,What is micro-cheating? Relationship experts share what to know and how to prevent it.,14,944,16,5,"Are you microcheating on your spouse? 03:47 With cheating in a relationship , whether physical or emotional, it's typically clear when things have gone too far — but what about your partner seemingly turning up the charm for a friend or co-worker? Are they flirting or just being friendly? According to relationship experts, those subtle acts may be ""micro-cheating."" Micro-cheating can involve following or ""liking"" photos of attractive people on social media or interactions on a day-to-day basis with people in real life. ""For example, revealing too much personal information to someone that you see regularly or intense flirting with someone at work, but never quite acting on it,"" Burrets said. Why do people micro-cheat? A few things can spur micro-cheating, and it can be intentional or unintentional. ""If a person has a pattern of pushing the boundaries in relationships and getting away with it, they might engage in these behaviors regularly and intentionally,"" Burrets said, where as ""someone who might feel dissatisfied or unfulfilled in a relationship might be trying to meet those needs or get satisfied elsewhere without fully consciously realizing it."" ""While it might be something about your relationship that is unfulfilling, it also could be something about yourself, your own life, your own self-esteem and your own satisfaction overall, that is compelling you to kind of get that attention fed elsewhere,"" she added. There may also be an evolutionary reason people micro-cheat, explained Wendy Walsh, a relationship expert at the website DatingAdvice and psychology professor with a doctorate in clinical psychology. ""According to evolutionary psychologists who have studied human mating cross-culturally around the world, all humans, no matter what relationship they're in, always keep in the back of their minds a backup mate, an idea that if something happened in their relationship, who they could call,"" she said. How micro-cheating impacts relationships Micro-cheating can negatively impact a couple in a number of ways. First, getting needs met outside of your primary relationship can lead to neglect of that relationship, Burrets said. ""We get a dopamine hit when we get attention and affection from others, and that dopamine hit is stronger when there's novelty involved. So when it's a new person, it can feel initially more compelling,"" she said. ""If we continue to put our energy in sources outside of our relationship, we only have so much bandwidth. And the danger is that we would neglect the nurturing and care of our own primary relationship."" The effects on a partner can vary. ""There's a broad spectrum for how partners react to this kind of behavior,"" Burrets said. ""For some people, flirting is a totally harmless behavior."" For others, it can feel like a threat, Walsh said. ""It can be very dangerous, because when you have one partner feeling threatened and is not feeling that they have a safe relationship or a secure attachment, then they're going to react in all kinds of ways,"" she said. ""If it continues for a long period of time, it can erode trust, and it can erode the feeling of safety in your primary relationship."" How to prevent micro-cheating To make sure you and your partner are on the same page about what is and isn't appropriate, experts advise having a conversation about boundaries and expectations early on. Burrets suggested having that conversation at the same time you talk about exclusivity. ""If exclusivity is part of your relationship, a lot of times we go in expecting that we both have the same concept of what exclusivity means, and we often don't,"" she said. Questions can include, ""How do we define exclusivity? What does that mean to us in this relationship?"" What if I suspect my partner is micro-cheating? If you haven't already had conversations about boundaries, now is the time to set expectations, Burrets said. ""Ideally you want to bring this up with a proactive tone, rather than a critical tone,"" she said. If your partner is violating pre-established boundaries, this is a time for greater intention and intensity, Burrets added. ""You don't want to come at this discussion from an emotionally dysregulated place, because it's likely to escalate and go absolutely nowhere,"" she said. ""Try to come at it from a place of curiosity as much as possible, even though you'll also be managing feelings of betrayal and hurt."" Walsh agreed, adding if you're accusatory, the other person is just going to be defensive. Instead, focus on your own feelings with ""I"" statements, experts suggest. For example: ""I noticed when you liked those women's pictures on Instagram that I had a feeling inside myself of worry that you are potentially going to leave me or that I wasn't as attractive, and that feeling showed me how much I value you and our relationship,"" Walsh said. She urged people to bring up their feelings if they want behavior to change. ""Remember, silence is always perceived as permission,"" Walsh said. Can micro-cheating lead to other forms of cheating? While micro-cheating doesn't have to lead to formal cheating, Burrets and Walsh said it can be a slippery slope. ""Especially for people who are feeling unsatisfied in their relationship, and then an actual need appears to be getting met by the micro-cheating. It kind of reinforces the behavior and maybe makes it more likely that the person will keep pushing the boundary,"" Burrets said.",2025-06-24T17:13:50.500384

Humans are far from being the only member of the animal kingdom that has mastered using tools. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish for termites, crows create hooked twigs to catch grubs and elephants swat flies with branches. Tool use in the world's difficult-to-study oceans is rarer, however sea otters are known to smash open shellfish with rocks, while octopuses can make mobile homes out of coconut shells. A study published in the journal Current Biology describes a new example of tool use by a critically endangered population of orcas. Scientists have been monitoring the southern resident killer whales in the Salish Sea, between the Canadian province of British Columbia and Washington state, for more than 50 years. Rachel John, a master's student at Exeter University in the U.K., told a press conference that she first noticed ""something kind of weird"" going on while watching drone camera footage last year. The researchers went back over old footage and were surprised to find this behavior is quite common, documenting 30 examples over eight days. One whale would use its teeth to break off a piece of bull kelp, which is strong but flexible like a garden hose. It would then put the kelp between its body and the body of another whale, and they would rub it between them for several minutes. The pair forms an ""S"" shape to keep the seaweed positioned between their bodies as they roll around. ""Skin maintenance behaviors"" Whales are already known to frolic through seaweed in a practice called ""kelping."" They are thought to do this partly for fun, partly to use the seaweed to scrub their bodies to remove dead skin. The international team of researchers called the new behavior ""allokelping,"" which means kelping with another whale. ""We hypothesize that allokelping is similar to skin maintenance behaviors exhibited by other cetaceans,"" the researchers wrote. They found that killer whales with more dead skin were more likely to engage in the activity, cautioning that it was a small sample size. Whales also tended to pair up with family members or others of a similar age, suggesting the activity has a social element. The scientists said it was the first known example of a marine mammal manufacturing a tool. Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University not involved in the study, praised the research but said it ""went a bit too far"" in some of its claims. And it could be argued that other whales known to use nets of bubbles or plumes of mud to hunt represent tool use benefitting multiple individuals, another first claimed in the paper, Mann said. However, the study's authors say allokelping may be the ""first case of non-human animals manipulating a tool with the core of their body rather than an appendage."" Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study's lead author, said it appeared to be just the latest example of socially learned behavior among animals that could be considered ""culture."" But the number of southern resident killer whales has dwindled to just 73, meaning we could soon lose this unique cultural tradition, he warned. ""If they disappear, we're never getting any of that back,"" he said. The whales mainly eat Chinook salmon, whose numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and other forms of human interference. The orcas and salmon are not alone — undersea kelp forests have also been devastated as ocean temperatures rise. Unless something changes, the outlook for southern resident killer whales is ""very bleak,"" Weiss warned. Earlier this year, an unusual spectacle featuring a pod of orcas was also caught on video when onlookers in Seattle were treated to the rare sight of the apex predators hunting a bird close to shore. Killer whales have made headlines for other reasons in recent years. Boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.

The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed ""Gwada negative,"" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery. ""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said. The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman ""is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,"" he said, adding: ""She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself."" The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene. The name ""Gwada negative"", which refers to the patient's origins and ""sounds good in all languages"", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.

Video shows the explosion, which SpaceX said occurred as the Starship was preparing for an engine test firing. The Starship ""experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" the company said in a post on X . ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,"" SpaceX said. The company said there are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities and asked that people avoid the area ""while safing operations continue."" Video from LabPadre, the company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, appears to show two major explosions — the first near the rocket's nose, and the second on the left side of the spacecraft. The Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and high-energy methane fuel at the time the detonations happened. The explosion may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday. Starship is comprised of a spacecraft and a Super Heavy rocket that together are intended to be a reusable system that can carry cargo and crew to the moon and Mars. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch astronauts on a mission to land near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights over the last two years, with the first three ending with explosions or breakups and the next three being partially successful. The next two resulted in explosions and the most recent flight, in May, reached its trajectory but broke up during atmospheric entry after spinning out of control. Known as Ship 36, SpaceX was planning to launch the Starship around the end of this month on a huge Super Heavy booster, in what would have been the rocket's 10th test fight.

Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget — and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines. During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making. They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls ""one big beautiful bill,"" which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid , a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage. ""If there isn't a funding mechanism in place, if there isn't an act of Congress to replace that revenue stream, hospitals are going to close. People are going to die. ... That's the consequence of your policies,"" Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan of Massachusetts said.

Kennedy said he's committed to doing ""evidence-based, gold-standard science"" to take care of ""the most desperate, most vulnerable Americans, including people of HIV."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the ""broken status quo,"" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is ""never an easy task. Here are some other highlights from the hearing. RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to ""defend the indefensible"" with his actions as secretary. ""There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,"" Pallone said. ""The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions."" Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to ""major decisions about vaccines."" ""Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?"" he said. ""You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this."" Kennedy said the ACIP committee — the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices — was the public process for regulating vaccines. ""You fired the ACIP committee ,"" Pallone said. ""I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,"" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with new picks , including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for ""impugning the reputation of a member of Congress."" Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone. Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's ""defend the spend"" initiative , which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it. ""Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?"" DeGette asked. ""About what?"" Kennedy asked. ""The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?"" she repeated. ""No,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils In defense of his NIH funding cuts , Kennedy said he cut ""thousands of studies"" that were doing ""nothing to improve American health"" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research. ""Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,"" Kennedy said. ""NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are — what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?"" Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts. COVID vaccines and pregnancy Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for childre n and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said ""study after study shows adverse events"" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed ""27 adverse events during pregnancy."" Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however, recently reiterated that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals. ""We're not depriving anybody of choice,"" Kennedy said. ""If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation."" ""Not true,"" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. ""We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true."" House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it ""extremely alarming"" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations ""without consulting the customary panel of experts."" ""You have lied to the American people"" In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of ""lying"" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel. ""But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,"" Schrier said. ""Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?"" Kennedy responded by saying he ""never made that agreement."" ""So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?"" Schrier said. ""If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,"" Kennedy said. ""It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,"" Schrier said. ""I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,"" Kennedy responded. ""Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,"" Schrier said. Republicans praise Kennedy Some Republicans referred to Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" or ""MAHA"" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, ""I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again."" Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his ""commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs."" Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue ""gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures."" Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: ""I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day."" During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it ""crashes through the red tape""; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors ; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August. ""We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,"" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors. United States Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement.

IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran.

Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport.

Humans are far from being the only member of the animal kingdom that has mastered using tools. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish for termites, crows create hooked twigs to catch grubs and elephants swat flies with branches. Tool use in the world's difficult-to-study oceans is rarer, however sea otters are known to smash open shellfish with rocks, while octopuses can make mobile homes out of coconut shells. A study published in the journal Current Biology describes a new example of tool use by a critically endangered population of orcas. Scientists have been monitoring the southern resident killer whales in the Salish Sea, between the Canadian province of British Columbia and Washington state, for more than 50 years. Rachel John, a master's student at Exeter University in the U.K., told a press conference that she first noticed ""something kind of weird"" going on while watching drone camera footage last year. The researchers went back over old footage and were surprised to find this behavior is quite common, documenting 30 examples over eight days. One whale would use its teeth to break off a piece of bull kelp, which is strong but flexible like a garden hose. It would then put the kelp between its body and the body of another whale, and they would rub it between them for several minutes. The pair forms an ""S"" shape to keep the seaweed positioned between their bodies as they roll around. ""Skin maintenance behaviors"" Whales are already known to frolic through seaweed in a practice called ""kelping."" They are thought to do this partly for fun, partly to use the seaweed to scrub their bodies to remove dead skin. The international team of researchers called the new behavior ""allokelping,"" which means kelping with another whale. ""We hypothesize that allokelping is similar to skin maintenance behaviors exhibited by other cetaceans,"" the researchers wrote. They found that killer whales with more dead skin were more likely to engage in the activity, cautioning that it was a small sample size. Whales also tended to pair up with family members or others of a similar age, suggesting the activity has a social element. The scientists said it was the first known example of a marine mammal manufacturing a tool. Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University not involved in the study, praised the research but said it ""went a bit too far"" in some of its claims. And it could be argued that other whales known to use nets of bubbles or plumes of mud to hunt represent tool use benefitting multiple individuals, another first claimed in the paper, Mann said. However, the study's authors say allokelping may be the ""first case of non-human animals manipulating a tool with the core of their body rather than an appendage."" Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study's lead author, said it appeared to be just the latest example of socially learned behavior among animals that could be considered ""culture."" But the number of southern resident killer whales has dwindled to just 73, meaning we could soon lose this unique cultural tradition, he warned. ""If they disappear, we're never getting any of that back,"" he said. The whales mainly eat Chinook salmon, whose numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and other forms of human interference. The orcas and salmon are not alone — undersea kelp forests have also been devastated as ocean temperatures rise. Unless something changes, the outlook for southern resident killer whales is ""very bleak,"" Weiss warned. Earlier this year, an unusual spectacle featuring a pod of orcas was also caught on video when onlookers in Seattle were treated to the rare sight of the apex predators hunting a bird close to shore. Killer whales have made headlines for other reasons in recent years. Boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.

The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed ""Gwada negative,"" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery. ""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said. The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman ""is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,"" he said, adding: ""She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself."" The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene. The name ""Gwada negative"", which refers to the patient's origins and ""sounds good in all languages"", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one.""

""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,"" his decision states. By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles. Authors had filed suit Anthropic cheered the ruling. The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to ""large-scale theft."" The authors also alleged that Anthropic ""seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works."" The authors' attorneys declined comment. Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots. At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders.

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap.""

""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oil-price-prices-iran-military-strike-crude-gasoline-cbs-news-explains/,World,2025-06-24T06:46:22-0400,What does the widening military conflict in Iran mean for oil prices? Here's what the experts say.,17,899,23,4,"Iran's threat to close the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt world oil prices 03:32 The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans. The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz , a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets. Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours. The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil. ""In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,"" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report. But, he added, ""[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long."" Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices. What's the impact so far on oil prices? After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06. Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68. Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring. ""Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,"" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report. Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy. What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed? Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring. Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy. Map of the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz showing maritime tanker traffic in September 2024. The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts. ""[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,"" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. ""In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP."" The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation. What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices? American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.

Humans are far from being the only member of the animal kingdom that has mastered using tools. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish for termites, crows create hooked twigs to catch grubs and elephants swat flies with branches. Tool use in the world's difficult-to-study oceans is rarer, however sea otters are known to smash open shellfish with rocks, while octopuses can make mobile homes out of coconut shells. A study published in the journal Current Biology describes a new example of tool use by a critically endangered population of orcas. Scientists have been monitoring the southern resident killer whales in the Salish Sea, between the Canadian province of British Columbia and Washington state, for more than 50 years. Rachel John, a master's student at Exeter University in the U.K., told a press conference that she first noticed ""something kind of weird"" going on while watching drone camera footage last year. The researchers went back over old footage and were surprised to find this behavior is quite common, documenting 30 examples over eight days. One whale would use its teeth to break off a piece of bull kelp, which is strong but flexible like a garden hose. It would then put the kelp between its body and the body of another whale, and they would rub it between them for several minutes. The pair forms an ""S"" shape to keep the seaweed positioned between their bodies as they roll around. ""Skin maintenance behaviors"" Whales are already known to frolic through seaweed in a practice called ""kelping."" They are thought to do this partly for fun, partly to use the seaweed to scrub their bodies to remove dead skin. The international team of researchers called the new behavior ""allokelping,"" which means kelping with another whale. ""We hypothesize that allokelping is similar to skin maintenance behaviors exhibited by other cetaceans,"" the researchers wrote. They found that killer whales with more dead skin were more likely to engage in the activity, cautioning that it was a small sample size. Whales also tended to pair up with family members or others of a similar age, suggesting the activity has a social element. The scientists said it was the first known example of a marine mammal manufacturing a tool. Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University not involved in the study, praised the research but said it ""went a bit too far"" in some of its claims. And it could be argued that other whales known to use nets of bubbles or plumes of mud to hunt represent tool use benefitting multiple individuals, another first claimed in the paper, Mann said. However, the study's authors say allokelping may be the ""first case of non-human animals manipulating a tool with the core of their body rather than an appendage."" Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study's lead author, said it appeared to be just the latest example of socially learned behavior among animals that could be considered ""culture."" But the number of southern resident killer whales has dwindled to just 73, meaning we could soon lose this unique cultural tradition, he warned. ""If they disappear, we're never getting any of that back,"" he said. The whales mainly eat Chinook salmon, whose numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and other forms of human interference. The orcas and salmon are not alone — undersea kelp forests have also been devastated as ocean temperatures rise. Unless something changes, the outlook for southern resident killer whales is ""very bleak,"" Weiss warned. Earlier this year, an unusual spectacle featuring a pod of orcas was also caught on video when onlookers in Seattle were treated to the rare sight of the apex predators hunting a bird close to shore. Killer whales have made headlines for other reasons in recent years. Boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.

The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed ""Gwada negative,"" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery. ""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said. The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman ""is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,"" he said, adding: ""She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself."" The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene. The name ""Gwada negative"", which refers to the patient's origins and ""sounds good in all languages"", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.

If you need to borrow money, then you'll want to ensure that you're doing so in the most cost-effective way. And, in recent years, that has often been via a home equity loan . When interest rates spiked on other borrowing products, home equity loans weren't immune. But with the home serving as collateral in these exchanges, lenders offered lower rates than they would with other, unsecured debt types . Combine that with a spike in home equity levels that have left the average homeowner with $300,000-plus in equity to utilize, and this became an obvious borrowing tool for many, especially for smaller amounts like $50,000. This loan amount allowed owners to keep a sizable amount of equity as a cushion for future use while still allowing them to pay for a wide range of expenses now. But, again, it does come with the home serving as collateral, which could be risky for homeowners , especially in today's hard-to-predict economic climate. Personal loans , on the other hand, do not utilize the home as a funding source and, thus, could be a viable way to borrow that same $50,000 right now. To better determine which makes the most sense for your financial circumstances, it helps to compare the potential repayment costs of each. So, which is cheaper this June: a $50,000 home equity loan or a $50,000 personal loan? That's what we'll break down below. Start by seeing how much home equity you could borrow here . $50,000 home equity loan vs. $50,000 personal loan: Which is cheaper this June? The median personal loan interest rate is currently 12.65% while the average home equity loan interest rate is 8.25% for a five-year loan. While personal loan term lengths can vary, the difference in the rates is reflected in starkly different repayment amounts each month. Here's what each would look like over 60 months: 5-year $50,000 home equity loan at 8.25%: $1,019.81 per month 5-year $50,000 personal loan at 12.65%: $1,128.72 per month Monthly payment difference: The home equity loan is around $109 cheaper each month and approximately $6,540 over the five years. Not only is the $50,000 home equity loan cheaper both monthly and over the full repayment period , it will remain so unless the homeowner refinances it (assuming personal loan rates don't plunge during that period). That's because home equity loan interest rates are fixed while personal loan rates can be both variable and fixed, injecting some uncertainty into the equations above. In other words, if you want to pay less each month, save money over the long term and don't want to stress over a potentially variable interest rate, borrowing $50,000 with a home equity loan instead of a personal loan is often the better decision. See how low a home equity loan rate you could qualify for here . What about a $50,000 HELOC? A $50,000 HELOC could be the more attractive borrowing option when compared to these two alternatives. HELOC rates are down by more than 1.5 points from where they were last September and, this spring, briefly fell below 8% . But HELOCs could also be a risky combination of both of the above options. That's because they also use the home as collateral (like a home equity loan) but the rates here almost always variable, making long-term budgeting particularly difficult for homeowners. And with the average HELOC rate being about the same as a home equity loan at 8.27% now, there's no obvious advantage to using this specific home equity borrowing tool this June (unless you're confident rate cuts are imminent and want to be positioned to exploit them when they're issued). The bottom line A $50,000 home equity loan is substantially cheaper than a $50,000 personal loan this June, saving borrowers money both monthly and annually. And those repayments will be fixed, allowing homeowners to budget with precision, unlike with a variable-rate HELOC or some personal loans. Just be sure to use the home equity loan for advantageous purposes (and to avoid risky ones) to ensure that it works for your financial goals both now and into the future.",2025-06-24T17:14:26.704978

Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of ""TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols."" He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s. Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — ""Little Woman,"" ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me,"" ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" and ""La La La (If I Had You)."" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including ""Here Comes Bobby,"" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show ""Shindig!"" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series — ""Here Come the Brides"" (1968-70) and ""Getting Together"" (1971). After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times."" Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band. ""I was brought up in a fairly strict family,"" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. ""Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.""

He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda , Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with ""Shindig!"" Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in ""Here Come the Brides,"" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, ""Seattle,"" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons. Following the series, Sherman starred in ""Getting Together,"" a spinoff of ""The Partridge Family,"" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, ""Little Woman,"" earned a gold record in 1969. ""While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,"" The Tulsa World said in 1997. His movies included ""Wild In Streets,"" ""He is My Brother"" and ""Get Crazy."" Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: ""I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was."" Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross. ""If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times. ""I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody."" In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations. In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. ""When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the ""Twice a Citizen"" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: ""Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America."" Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era ""Teen Idols Tour"" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: ""Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group."" Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need. He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife. Music Entertainment",2025-06-24T17:14:33.192611
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/10000-1-year-cd-vs-10000-high-yield-savings-account-which-earns-more-interest-june-2025/,MoneyWatch,2025-06-24T15:38:16-0400,"$10,000 1-year CD vs. $10,000 high-yield savings account: Which will earn more interest?",13,679,21,6,"Both 1-year CD and high-yield savings accounts offer savers unique benefits right now. You never want to put your money into an account that won't earn interest. And in the economic climate of recent years, you really couldn't afford to. With inflation at a decades-high, interest rates at their highest point in years and the cost of everyday expenses elevated, your money needed to work for you as much as possible. Fortunately, for those who took advantage, both certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts offered effective pathways to do this, with both savings vehicles offering interest rates over 4% and sometimes even higher. But the economy is evolving again. Inflation is down multiple points from where it was in June 2022, for example, and interest rate cuts were issued in 2024 and could be issued again later this year. This means that savers will need to be a bit more strategic in their approach and it may mean reevaluating where they keep large, five-figure amounts of money right now. With a CD, they may be able to lock in long-term protection with a 1-year term, but with a high-yield savings account, they can earn a high rate and maintain access to their funds. To better determine which option is more beneficial for a $10,000 deposit made now, it can be helpful to calculate the interest-earning opportunity for both. Below, we'll complete the calculations. See how much more money you could be earning with a high-rate CD here . $10,000 1-year CD vs. $10,000 high-yield savings account: Which will earn more interest? Calculating the interest on either account type is relatively straightforward. You'll need the deposit amount (in this case, $10,000), the interest rate (4.45% for 1-year CDs and 4.30% for high-yield savings accounts) and the length of the account (both 12 months). That said, CD interest rates are fixed and high-yield savings account rates are variable, so predicting the latter interest earnings is difficult to do with precision as the rate can and likely will change over time. That said, here's what each could earn now, assuming the high-yield savings account rate remains constant: $10,000 1-year CD at 4.45%: $445.00 for a total of $10,445.00 $10,000 high-yield savings account at 4.30% after one year: $430.00 for a total of $10,430.00 Not only will you earn around $15 more with a 1-year CD in this example, but those earnings will be guaranteed versus the high-yield savings account, which won't be thanks to the variable rate. And while that could change positively (if rates are hiked and high-yield savings account rates rise alongside it), that appears unlikely now. With the CME Group's FedWatch tool listing a rate cut at more than a 75% likelihood for September, which will lead to a reduction in savings rates, perhaps before that point, many savers would benefit from depositing their $10,000 into a CD account instead. Get started with a 1-year CD here . What about money market accounts? A money market account could be a viable alternative for those looking to deposit $10,000 or more right now. Interest rates on these accounts are high and comparable to the top high-yield savings accounts. Plus, money market accounts won't require you to forego access to your money like a CD would, and they come with other features, like check-writing. But the big caveat remains the same: These accounts also have variable interest rates, which are also subject to decline later this year, making them a risk for savers looking to exploit today's high-rate climate for an extended period. The bottom line A $10,000 1-year CD earns more interest than a $10,000 high-yield savings account if opened now and that interest will be guaranteed, unlike a high-yield savings account with a variable rate. That said, you'll only be able to earn that $445 if you keep your money in the account for the full CD term . Take it out early and you'll get hit with an early withdrawal penalty , so keep that in mind when comparing these two accounts.",2025-06-24T17:14:34.839687

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap."" Palestinian women and girls mourn relatives killed while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty ""Humanitarian principles must be reinstated,"" Lazzarini said in his statement. ""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption. This image from video shows a SpaceX Starship upper stage exploding at the Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, June 18, 2025. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV. But the company said there is ""no commonality"" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship. ""Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,"" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. ""If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design."" The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week. Such ""hotfire"" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th ""integrated flight test."" But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing. The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast. Flames rise as a SpaceX rocket explodes ahead of an engine test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, June 18, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted. ""On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" SpaceX said in a statement on X. ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. ""There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area."" What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known. NASA counting on Starship for moon mission SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages. The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. It will not be easy. To get the Human Landing System — HLS — Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a ""depot"" Starship, undock, and return to Earth. The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule. SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon. NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement. While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that ""NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions."" ""We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission."" Elon Musk SpaceX",2025-06-24T17:14:38.054189

Alessandro Coatti , 42, worked for Britain's Royal Society of Biology as a science policy officer whose job included giving evidence to parliament, before leaving that post in 2024 to travel in South America. Part of his body was found in a suitcase on a riverbank on April 6. Other remains were later found in other locations. Coatti had arrived in Santa Marta, a city that acts as a gateway to idyllic palm-lined Caribbean beaches and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountain range, as a tourist. The police said he was lured by a gang that planned to rob him to an abandoned house in the city, through a dating app for the LGBTQ community. Scientist Alessandro Coatti was reported missing in Santa Marta, Colombia, on April 5, 2025. Royal Society of Biology El Tiempo quoted a local hotel worker as saying Coatti was conducting research on local animal species and had asked about visiting the village of Minca, about six miles southeast of Santa Marta. Santa Marta's Mayor Carlos Pinedo said Sunday that four people suspected of his murder and dismemberment had been arrested in raids in the Colombian capital Bogota, the second city of Medellin as well as in Santa Marta and the town of Arjona, near the port city of Cartagena. At a press conference on Monday , Santa Marta police chief Colonel Jaime Rios said that the police had received a tip-off, which led them to a house where traces of blood were found. ""Through arduous investigative work, interviews were conducted, biological traces belonging to the victim were collected, and security camera footage was analyzed, which were all key to solving the case,"" he said. The gruesome killing of Coatti, described by colleagues at the Royal Society of Biology as a respected scientist, caused shock in Colombia. ""He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organizing events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,"" the RSB said in a statement after Coatti's death. ""Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with, and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him."" Pinedo had offered a reward of $12,000 for information leading to the capture of his killers. Rios said the reward had led to the breakthrough in the investigation. The Sierra Nevada mountains are home to a drug-running paramilitary gang known as the ""Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada."" It is not known if they had any hand in Coatti's murder, but they have been linked to the murder and dismemberment of others in recent years. Colombia Italy Murder",2025-06-24T17:14:39.691144

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops. The Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible. Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:14:41.324620

Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that ""the ceasefire is in effect."" The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was ""on track"" to make that ""historic commitment"" of 5%. During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels. ""[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,"" Rutte wrote. He called it ""truly extraordinary"" and said it was ""something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer."" And of the new spending, Rutte said, ""It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!"" He called it an ""important moment for America and Europe,"" and told him, ""You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done."" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump. The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target. ""We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,"" he told reporters Friday. ""So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely."" There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending. Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique — Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this. ""Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,"" Whitaker said, adding, ""I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies."" He said that the U.S. is ""calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,"" and he went on to say that the U.S. is ""engaged at the highest levels"" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. ""put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,"" and she added, ""I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors."" Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting three Iranian sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes ""very weak,"" and he said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, ""We didn't harm anyone."" Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end. The NATO summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, instead of multiple sessions. Mr. Trump also plans to meet separately with several world leaders on the sidelines, a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call Friday. The president left for the summit early Tuesday morning and returns Wednesday. NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is the largest defense alliance in the world, with 32 members, including the U.S. It was formed in the aftermath of World War II, and has grown since, with its latest additions being Finland in 2023 and Sweden in 2024.

This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks."" The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program. In response to the strikes, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties. The attack came after Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran. Israeli officials have said at least 28 people in Israel have died in Iran's missile attacks. A ceasefire announced by President Trump between Israel and Iran appears to be holding on Tuesday, with the two sides halting their exchange of fire after 12 days.

He was 81. His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram : ""Bobby left this world holding my hand — just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light."" Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year. American singer and teen idol Bobby Sherman, circa 1970. Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of ""TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols."" He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s. Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — ""Little Woman,"" ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me,"" ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" and ""La La La (If I Had You)."" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including ""Here Comes Bobby,"" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show ""Shindig!"" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series — ""Here Come the Brides"" (1968-70) and ""Getting Together"" (1971). After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times."" Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band. ""I was brought up in a fairly strict family,"" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. ""Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous."" Singer Bobby Sherman at a recording session in Los Angeles, March 13, 1967. He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda , Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with ""Shindig!"" Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in ""Here Come the Brides,"" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, ""Seattle,"" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons. Following the series, Sherman starred in ""Getting Together,"" a spinoff of ""The Partridge Family,"" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, ""Little Woman,"" earned a gold record in 1969. ""While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,"" The Tulsa World said in 1997. His movies included ""Wild In Streets,"" ""He is My Brother"" and ""Get Crazy."" Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: ""I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was."" Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross. ""If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times. ""I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody."" In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations. In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. ""When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the ""Twice a Citizen"" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: ""Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America."" Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era ""Teen Idols Tour"" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: ""Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group."" Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need. He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife. Music Entertainment",2025-06-24T17:14:46.205907
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fear-of-flying-airplane-tips-experts/,Health,2025-02-20T18:02:57-0500,Plane crashes can spark fear of flying. Here are tips to help you cope and ease airplane anxiety.,18,1158,21,9,"Transportation secretary says it's safe to fly after series of plane crashes 04:38 If headlines of recent plane crashes and close calls have you worried about air travel, you're not alone — but there are things to keep in mind to help ease anxiety about flying. While most Americans still believe air transportation is generally safe, confidence in air travel and the federal agencies in charge of air safety has fallen, according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. The survey found that 64% of U.S. adults say they think plane travel is ""very safe"" or ""somewhat safe,"" but that's down slightly from last year , when 71% said so. About 20% now say they consider air transportation is very or somewhat unsafe, up from 12% in 2024. The poll was conducted shortly after the deadly Jan. 30 collision between an American Airlines flight and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in Washington, D.C., but before the Feb. 17 incident where a Delta flight from Minneapolis flipped upside down while landing in Toronto. Wednesday, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy sought to reassure Americans that ""of course"" it's safe to fly. ""If you get in a plane, if you look at how many people fly, how many flights we have, of course it's a safe space,"" Duffy said. He noted that there isn't a pattern behind the recent incidents, calling each of them ""very unique,"" and said investigators will determine what went wrong so systems can continue to improve. ""There are so many (strategies), and it really depends on the person. Number one is, do what works for you,"" said Cohen, whose work, including his book ""Be The Sun, Not The Salt,"" focuses on helping people become their best selves. Here are some suggestions to consider. Remember the odds The odds of dying in a commercial air accident was about 1 in 13.7 million from 2018 to 2022 — a much lower rate than car crash deaths in 2023, where the odds were 1 in 95, according to the National Safety Council. ""Statistically, flying is way safer than any other form of transportation. However, the stories, the tragedies, the crashes — they make us think that it isn't,"" Cohen said. This is called ""availability bias,"" explains Alyssa Mairanz, a licensed mental health counselor and owner of Empower Your Mind Therapy . Avoid triggering content Avoiding or limiting your exposure to upsetting content related to flights can help calm your thoughts. ""Stop watching the news or obsessing over it, because ruminating with negative thoughts can sometimes make you feel worse,"" Mairanz said. Cohen said to be mindful that you can't un-see an image. ""Once you've seen the plane flip over and on the Toronto tarmac, you can't not see that image,"" he said, adding that you'll likely have to pair this with other coping strategies. Take steps to prepare To reduce anxiety around flying, Cohen suggests preparing as best you can. ""Anything that creates more generalized anxiety is not going to be helpful,"" he said. This includes giving yourself enough time to avoid rushing. And he suggests avoiding caffeine and alcohol. ""People might think taking a few drinks is helpful. It usually isn't,"" he said. Take time to mentally prepare, too. ""Remember all the things that you know about flying, because you've flown for many, many years and it is a very safe means of transportation,"" he said. Seek out support Traveling with a friend or striking up conversation with your seatmate can also help. ""Talking to someone next to you, holding their hand... it can help,"" Cohen said. Don't ignore the flight professionals, either. ""Flight attendants are skilled at talking to you and helping you feel less anxious. They can give you more information and come by and check on you,"" he said You can also talk to a doctor about medicinal support. ""There's medication that can calm your nerves prior to flying so that you're prepared — whether that's a an anti-anxiety medication, which you take on occasion, or a beta blocker, which is for performance anxiety ... it calms your physiological symptoms,"" Cohen said. Reach for healthy distractions While on a flight, use healthy distraction to avoid negative thoughts. This could be a movie, a game on your phone, a book or any activity that keeps your mind busy. ""It's not going to change the fact that you're not in control — you're not flying the plane, but you have to relinquish that control and do only what you can do, which is, I can control my body. I can control some of my thoughts, and I can regulate my emotions. I can listen to music that is either calming or uplifting. All of those things are are good emotional shifters,"" Cohen said. Mairanz said the acronym TIPP, a exercise used in Dialectical Behavior Therapy, can help regulate extreme emotions quickly. Here's how to adapt it for travel: T - Temperature: Whether it's putting a cold drink to your cheek or blasting the A/C in your face, the coolness can ""trigger the 'dive response,' which lowers heart rate and activates your parasympathetic nervous system,"" she explained. I - Intense exercise: ""Intense exercise can bring down the 'flight-or-fight' response, releasing endorphins and taking your mind off negativity,"" Mairanz said. ""Try fast-paced walking in the airport for a moment or opening and closing your arms quickly inflight — within reason to avoid hitting your seat mate."" P - Paced breathing: ""Focusing on your breath helps gain control of your thoughts. Close your eyes and breathe in deeply. Can you feel your belly move in and out? Try it again several times, lengthening your breath in and out, trying to exhale longer than inhaling. Focus on your breath, not your mind, as your body begins to calm,"" she said. P - Paired muscle relaxation: Tensing and relaxing your muscles can help let go of stress tension in the body, Mairanz said. ""As you inhale, clench your muscles tightly and release on the exhale. Try this several times focusing on different parts of the body,"" she suggested. When to consider additional help It's valid to have anxiety over flying, but recognize if it's starting to negatively impact your life. ""If it starts to become all-consuming, it may be best to talk with a therapist about your fears and additional skills to overcome it,"" Mairanz said.

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops.

Rubin Observatory The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible. Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:14:49.429402

""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said.

The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption. This image from video shows a SpaceX Starship upper stage exploding at the Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, June 18, 2025. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV. But the company said there is ""no commonality"" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship. ""Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,"" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. ""If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design."" The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week. Such ""hotfire"" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th ""integrated flight test."" But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing. The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast. Flames rise as a SpaceX rocket explodes ahead of an engine test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, June 18, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted. ""On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" SpaceX said in a statement on X. ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. ""There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area."" What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known. NASA counting on Starship for moon mission SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages. The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. It will not be easy. To get the Human Landing System — HLS — Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a ""depot"" Starship, undock, and return to Earth. The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule. SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon. NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement.

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

In his TikTok posts, Sarmiento spoke about the leader of the Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero, who is one of the country's most wanted criminals known by the alias ""Nino Guerrero."" The U.S. State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Venezuelan government has maintained that the Tren de Aragua — which the U.S. considers a ""terrorist"" organization — has already been dismantled and denies its existence. Sarmiento shared photos and videos of alleged members of the gang and denounced the ""extortion"" by police officers. ""I was kidnapped by... DAET — the police's Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions,"" he stated in one of his final videos. ""We are overrun with delinquent officials who work with common criminals,"" he added. Sarmiento's murder marks the latest in a string of deadly attacks on popular social media figures. Earlier this month, Pakistani police said 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf was shot dead by a man who had repeatedly contacted her online. And last month, the murder of a young influencer during a livestream in Jalisco, in western Mexico, shocked the country. Authorities insisted there was no ""evidence"" that the murder of 23-year-old Valeria Márquez was linked to organized crime, and prosecutors opened an investigation for ""femicide.""

The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be ""helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks."" The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program. In response to the strikes, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties. The attack came after Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran. Israeli officials have said at least 28 people in Israel have died in Iran's missile attacks.

He was 81. His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram : ""Bobby left this world holding my hand — just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light."" Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year. American singer and teen idol Bobby Sherman, circa 1970. Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of ""TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols."" He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s. Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — ""Little Woman,"" ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me,"" ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" and ""La La La (If I Had You)."" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including ""Here Comes Bobby,"" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show ""Shindig!"" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series — ""Here Come the Brides"" (1968-70) and ""Getting Together"" (1971). After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times."" Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band. ""I was brought up in a fairly strict family,"" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. ""Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous."" Singer Bobby Sherman at a recording session in Los Angeles, March 13, 1967. He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda , Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with ""Shindig!"" Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in ""Here Come the Brides,"" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, ""Seattle,"" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons. Following the series, Sherman starred in ""Getting Together,"" a spinoff of ""The Partridge Family,"" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, ""Little Woman,"" earned a gold record in 1969. ""While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,"" The Tulsa World said in 1997. His movies included ""Wild In Streets,"" ""He is My Brother"" and ""Get Crazy."" Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: ""I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was."" Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross. ""If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times. ""I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody."" In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations. In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. ""When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the ""Twice a Citizen"" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: ""Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America."" Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era ""Teen Idols Tour"" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: ""Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group."" Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need. He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife. Music Entertainment",2025-06-24T17:15:00.788616

Humans are far from being the only member of the animal kingdom that has mastered using tools. Chimpanzees fashion sticks to fish for termites, crows create hooked twigs to catch grubs and elephants swat flies with branches. Tool use in the world's difficult-to-study oceans is rarer, however sea otters are known to smash open shellfish with rocks, while octopuses can make mobile homes out of coconut shells. A study published in the journal Current Biology describes a new example of tool use by a critically endangered population of orcas. Scientists have been monitoring the southern resident killer whales in the Salish Sea, between the Canadian province of British Columbia and Washington state, for more than 50 years. Rachel John, a master's student at Exeter University in the U.K., told a press conference that she first noticed ""something kind of weird"" going on while watching drone camera footage last year. The researchers went back over old footage and were surprised to find this behavior is quite common, documenting 30 examples over eight days. One whale would use its teeth to break off a piece of bull kelp, which is strong but flexible like a garden hose. It would then put the kelp between its body and the body of another whale, and they would rub it between them for several minutes. The pair forms an ""S"" shape to keep the seaweed positioned between their bodies as they roll around. ""Skin maintenance behaviors"" Whales are already known to frolic through seaweed in a practice called ""kelping."" They are thought to do this partly for fun, partly to use the seaweed to scrub their bodies to remove dead skin. The international team of researchers called the new behavior ""allokelping,"" which means kelping with another whale. ""We hypothesize that allokelping is similar to skin maintenance behaviors exhibited by other cetaceans,"" the researchers wrote. They found that killer whales with more dead skin were more likely to engage in the activity, cautioning that it was a small sample size. Whales also tended to pair up with family members or others of a similar age, suggesting the activity has a social element. The scientists said it was the first known example of a marine mammal manufacturing a tool. Janet Mann, a biologist at Georgetown University not involved in the study, praised the research but said it ""went a bit too far"" in some of its claims. And it could be argued that other whales known to use nets of bubbles or plumes of mud to hunt represent tool use benefitting multiple individuals, another first claimed in the paper, Mann said. However, the study's authors say allokelping may be the ""first case of non-human animals manipulating a tool with the core of their body rather than an appendage."" Michael Weiss, research director at the Center for Whale Research and the study's lead author, said it appeared to be just the latest example of socially learned behavior among animals that could be considered ""culture."" But the number of southern resident killer whales has dwindled to just 73, meaning we could soon lose this unique cultural tradition, he warned. ""If they disappear, we're never getting any of that back,"" he said. The whales mainly eat Chinook salmon, whose numbers have plummeted due to overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction and other forms of human interference. The orcas and salmon are not alone — undersea kelp forests have also been devastated as ocean temperatures rise. Unless something changes, the outlook for southern resident killer whales is ""very bleak,"" Weiss warned. Earlier this year, an unusual spectacle featuring a pod of orcas was also caught on video when onlookers in Seattle were treated to the rare sight of the apex predators hunting a bird close to shore. Killer whales have made headlines for other reasons in recent years. Boaters in Europe have reported several instances of orcas ramming into their vessels in a pattern that baffled many marine experts. Sailors said they resorted to everything from throwing sand in the water to setting off fireworks to blasting thrash metal music in efforts to ward off the encroaching predators.

The federal statistics show nearly half — or 47% — of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation. ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses — while the agency attempts to deport them. As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers. Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day. The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees. ""If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system. The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows. Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office. ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records. But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana . It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress. Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds. Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Florida would receive federal funds to set up those facilities. Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity. In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a ""massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States"" has led to ""a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity."" ""ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,"" ICE added, noting the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds. Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population. ""I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants — both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,"" Kocher said.

""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said. The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said.

The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene. The name ""Gwada negative"", which refers to the patient's origins and ""sounds good in all languages"", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years.

One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops.

Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:15:07.330650

Eight children have come down with severe food poisoning since June 12 after consuming meat products from the two businesses in the northern city of Saint-Quentin. Five of them contracted a rare foodborne illness called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including a 12-year-old girl who died. HUS in most cases occurs after someone ingests E.coli , commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is ""impossible at this stage to confirm that the consumption of products from these two establishments is the source of the contamination,"" local authorities said. But the children all consumed meat or meat products from these two butchers a few days before symptoms appeared, it said. Authorities have closed the two shops as a precautionary measure while samples from both stores are tested. The authorities said they should have the results ""early next week"" and an investigation has been launched into where the meat came from. HUS affects between 100 and 165 children in France each year, according to the country's public health agency. E. coli outbreaks have also made headlines recently in the U.S. Earlier this month, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that ground beef that was distributed nationwide may be contaminated with E. coli. In November, a carrot recall was issued by California grower Grimmway Farms after nearly 40 cases were recorded in 18 states. At least 15 people were hospitalized and one person died, the CDC said .

Then, after speaking with Israel's prime minister, Mr. Trump said Israel would not continue attacking Iran and declared, ""the Ceasefire is in effect. "" Read more here . Israel and Iran said Tuesday they are complying with a ceasefire agreement announced by President Trump. Mr. Trump said on Truth Social just after 1 a.m. ET Tuesday that a ceasefire he announced earlier between the two countries ""IS NOW IN EFFECT. PLEASE DO NOT VIOLATE IT!"" The Israeli government announced that, ""In light of achieving the objectives of the operation, and in full coordination with President Trump, Israel has agreed to the president's proposal for a bilateral ceasefire. Israel will respond forcefully to any violation of the ceasefire."" At about the same time, Iranian state television said the ceasefire had begun. Mr. Trump posted Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed on a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE"", a move he said would end the more than weeklong conflict between the two countries. The ceasefire was to take hold in stages, the president said. The Israel Defense Forces had reported a series of missile barrages from Iran both before and after Mr. Trump's midnight deadline for Iran to halt the strikes. Israel did not specify when the missiles were launched, and it's unclear whether the latest missile strikes violated the terms laid out by Mr. Trump. Hours after Mr. Trump's initia l post, Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi suggested on X that Iran had stopped its strikes on Israel at 4 a.m. Tehran time (8:30 p.m. ET Monday). Iran's military operations ""continued until the very last minute,"" he wrote. But Araghchi also wrote that ""there is NO 'agreement' on any ceasefire or cessation of military operations,"" though he added that Iran didn't plan to continue strikes on Israel if Israel also ceased strikes at the same time. The timeline laid out by Mr. Trump called for Israel to stop striking about 15 hours after the time specified by Araghchi. ""The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,"" Araghchi wrote. In another Truth Social post later Monday night, following the Iranian foreign minister's comments, Mr. Trump wrote, in part, that Israel and Iran ""came to me, almost simultaneously, and said, 'PEACE!' I knew the time was NOW."" Mr. Trump communicated directly with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, while several other administration officials — Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — communicated with Iran through direct and indirect channels, the White House official said. Qatar helped broker a deal, another White House official said. Mr. Trump had asked the Qatari Emir to get Iran to agree to a ceasefire. Vance coordinated with the Qatari prime minister on details, and Iran agreed to the ceasefire after speaking to the prime minister. The official said the direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base. The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13 with Israel launching airstrikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iran's attacks have killed at least 24 people in Israel, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Dispute over Iran's nuclear program still lingers It's not clear how the ceasefire announcement will impact a broader dispute over the fate of Iran's nuclear program. Israel's campaign was primarily aimed at Iran's nuclear program, as the country's stockpile of near weapons-grade uranium has grown rapidly in recent months, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Israel has alleged Iran was secretly ""racing towards a nuclear bomb."" But earlier this year, U.S. intelligence agencies assessed that Iran was not making nuclear weapons, though ""pressure has probably built"" for Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, to reauthorize the country's nuclear weapons program. Iran has long insisted its uranium enrichment program is peaceful. Mr. Trump said over the weekend the U.S.'s strikes had ""obliterated"" three Iranian nuclear sites, including two subterranean uranium enrichment facilities, though Iran has downplayed the damage.

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim. Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry, retired from NASA in 2018 and now works for Axiom.

Now retired from NASA, Whitson is America's most experienced astronaut with three ISS missions and an earlier Axiom commercial flight to her credit. NASA Going into the Ax-4 flight, Whitson had logged 675 days in space across three NASA flights and one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space. As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission ""opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.""

Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget — and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines. During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making. They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls ""one big beautiful bill,"" which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid , a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage. ""If there isn't a funding mechanism in place, if there isn't an act of Congress to replace that revenue stream, hospitals are going to close. People are going to die. ... That's the consequence of your policies,"" Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan of Massachusetts said. The Trump administration has already made cuts to funding for research at the National Institutes of Health and other resource and treatment programs. ""This isn't a budget, it's a death sentence,"" said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, referring to proposed cuts to the HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated . Carter submitted to the record what he described as a ""whole bunch of studies (that) debunk"" many of Kennedy's claims and prove he's not ""being forthright with us or the American people."" Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York allowed Kennedy to respond to what Langworthy described as Carter's ""outlandish claims."" Kennedy said he's committed to doing ""evidence-based, gold-standard science"" to take care of ""the most desperate, most vulnerable Americans, including people of HIV."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the ""broken status quo,"" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is ""never an easy task. Here are some other highlights from the hearing. RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to ""defend the indefensible"" with his actions as secretary. ""There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,"" Pallone said. ""The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions."" Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to ""major decisions about vaccines."" ""Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?"" he said. ""You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this."" Kennedy said the ACIP committee — the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices — was the public process for regulating vaccines. ""You fired the ACIP committee ,"" Pallone said. ""I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,"" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with new picks , including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for ""impugning the reputation of a member of Congress."" Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone. Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's ""defend the spend"" initiative , which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it. ""Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?"" DeGette asked. ""About what?"" Kennedy asked. ""The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?"" she repeated. ""No,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils In defense of his NIH funding cuts , Kennedy said he cut ""thousands of studies"" that were doing ""nothing to improve American health"" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research. ""Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,"" Kennedy said. ""NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are — what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?"" Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts. COVID vaccines and pregnancy Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for childre n and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said ""study after study shows adverse events"" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed ""27 adverse events during pregnancy."" Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however, recently reiterated that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals. ""We're not depriving anybody of choice,"" Kennedy said. ""If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation."" ""Not true,"" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. ""We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true."" House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it ""extremely alarming"" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations ""without consulting the customary panel of experts."" ""You have lied to the American people"" In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of ""lying"" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel. ""But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,"" Schrier said. ""Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?"" Kennedy responded by saying he ""never made that agreement."" ""So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?"" Schrier said. ""If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,"" Kennedy said. ""It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,"" Schrier said. ""I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,"" Kennedy responded. ""Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,"" Schrier said. Republicans praise Kennedy Some Republicans referred to Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" or ""MAHA"" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, ""I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again."" Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his ""commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs."" Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue ""gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures."" Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: ""I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day."" During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it ""crashes through the red tape""; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors ; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August. ""We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,"" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors. United States Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/anthropic-ai-copyright-case-claude/,Health,2025-06-24T17:09:00-0400,"Anthropic wins key AI copyright case, but remains on the hook for using pirated books",15,503,18,4,"AI chatbot ""Debunk-Bot"" challenges conspiracy theories in new study 04:18 Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot. In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material. Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was ""quintessentially transformative"" and did not violate ""fair use"" doctrine under copyright law. ""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,"" his decision states. By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles. Authors had filed suit Anthropic cheered the ruling. The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to ""large-scale theft."" The authors also alleged that Anthropic ""seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works."" The authors' attorneys declined comment.

Here's what to know.,14,293,17,4,"First-ever Starbucks Global Barista champion crowned 00:49 Starbucks said Tuesday that the coffee chain is changing how it charges for beverage add-ins like matcha and syrups as it moves to standardize pricing across the company's stores. Starbucks will now charge 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce that modifies an unflavored drink, instead of charging for each addition. But the company noted that it won't charge customers to substitute a sauce or syrup in a pre-flavored drink, such as adding vanilla syrup to a Caffè Mocha. Starbucks also plans to charge $1 for adding a scoop of matcha powder to non-matcha drinks, and will charge 50 cents to include dried fruit in a beverage. The changes were reported earlier by Bloomberg News. The change is the latest under CEO Brian Niccol, who wants to overhaul the coffee giant's image as it looks to drive growth. As part of that effort, Niccol wants to improve customer service and ensure that Starbucks cafes are "" inviting places to linger ,"" among other goals and initiatives. The company on Tuesday also said it's conducting a limited customer test of a new feature in the Starbucks app to show pricing updates in real time when a consumer is ordering food or drinks. The goal is to provide better pricing transparency when people place an order, a Starbucks spokesperson said. Starbucks said customers can add its classic syrup, a liquid sugar akin to simple syrup, to any drink at no cost. Starbucks",2025-06-24T17:15:22.209152
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/silver-prices-surging-better-investment-than-gold-now/,MoneyWatch,2025-06-20T11:43:17-0400,Silver prices are surging. Is it a better investment than gold now?,12,736,21,6,"The rising price of silver could encourage investors to get started with the precious metal right now. There's been quite a bit of attention paid to the price of gold in recent years and with good reason. Starting 2024 priced at just over $2,000 per ounce, the price of the shiny yellow metal has surged since, now sitting around $3,400 for the same amount and with speculation high that it could soon hit a milestone of $4,000 , essentially doubling where it was in January 2024. That's a remarkable increase for any asset, but particularly so for gold since it's historically been better known as an income protector versus a steady income producer. In this climate, however, many investors may have overlooked the benefits of other precious metals at the same time. And that could be a costly mistake, especially now the price of silver is surging. Since January, silver has risen from $28.92 per ounce to $37.12 per ounce this week, according to American Hartford Gold . And while that may not seem particularly high on paper, it does mark a significant 28% rise in just over six months. Thanks to the powerful demand for industry usage in items like solar panels, this rise may evolve from a trend to a consistent pattern relatively soon, leading some investors to wonder if this is a better investment than gold now . But, is it? That's what we'll examine below. Start protecting your investments with precious metals here now . Is silver a better investment than gold, with prices surging? Ideally, investors will have a mix of precious metals in their portfolio encompassing both gold, silver, and maybe some other metals like palladium . Together, these should generally be limited to a maximum of 10% of your overall portfolio . While silver isn't necessarily a ""better"" investment than gold now, it can be a more attractive one for certain investors. Here's why: The entry price point is much lower: Simply put, unless you're buying fractional gold or taking a dollar-cost averaging approach, the entry price point for prospective gold investors right now is historically high. Silver, by comparison, even amid its recent price surge, is many times less expensive and much more affordable for a wider range of investors. Sure, you may not be able to sell it as quickly for as much of a profit as you would with gold, but if you want to get invested in a rising asset for an affordable price, silver offers both features right now. Get started with a silver investment here . You'll still hedge against inflation: Gold is a reliable inflation hedge thanks to its consistent ability to maintain value when inflation erodes the purchasing power of the U.S. dollar – but silver offers the same benefits for the same reason. And, as was shown in the most recent inflation reading released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, inflation remains a concern as the rate just increased, even if it was by a small margin. Still, to protect against this cycle of inflation and to shore up support in your portfolio for the next inevitable round, it makes sense to invest in silver now. You'll still diversify your portfolio: If one of the key considerations is to diversify your portfolio and you want to do so in an affordable way, then silver can help. A diversified portfolio, after all, is a more secure one, better equipped to weather economic volatility. And if you've overinvested in stocks, bonds or real estate, then it makes sense to diversify your portfolio with alternatives like gold and silver. And while gold may have the stronger reputation as a diversification tool, silver can offer the same feature for a much lower price. The bottom line Silver isn't a better or worse investment than gold now as that determination is often made on a case-by-case basis, dependent on the individual investor and their budget and goals. But with the price of silver rising now, the likelihood that demand will remain high, and the same inflation hedging and portfolio diversification benefits that gold can offer – all at a much lower price – investors may find that silver is worth a second look now.",2025-06-24T17:15:23.938318

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.

As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission ""opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.""

One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:15:30.444198

Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget — and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines. During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making. They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls ""one big beautiful bill,"" which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid , a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage. ""If there isn't a funding mechanism in place, if there isn't an act of Congress to replace that revenue stream, hospitals are going to close. People are going to die. ... That's the consequence of your policies,"" Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan of Massachusetts said. The Trump administration has already made cuts to funding for research at the National Institutes of Health and other resource and treatment programs. ""This isn't a budget, it's a death sentence,"" said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, referring to proposed cuts to the HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated . Carter submitted to the record what he described as a ""whole bunch of studies (that) debunk"" many of Kennedy's claims and prove he's not ""being forthright with us or the American people."" Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York allowed Kennedy to respond to what Langworthy described as Carter's ""outlandish claims."" Kennedy said he's committed to doing ""evidence-based, gold-standard science"" to take care of ""the most desperate, most vulnerable Americans, including people of HIV."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the ""broken status quo,"" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is ""never an easy task. Here are some other highlights from the hearing. RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to ""defend the indefensible"" with his actions as secretary. ""There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,"" Pallone said. ""The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions."" Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to ""major decisions about vaccines."" ""Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?"" he said. ""You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this."" Kennedy said the ACIP committee — the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices — was the public process for regulating vaccines. ""You fired the ACIP committee ,"" Pallone said. ""I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,"" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with new picks , including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for ""impugning the reputation of a member of Congress."" Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone. Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's ""defend the spend"" initiative , which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it. ""Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?"" DeGette asked. ""About what?"" Kennedy asked. ""The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?"" she repeated. ""No,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils In defense of his NIH funding cuts , Kennedy said he cut ""thousands of studies"" that were doing ""nothing to improve American health"" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research. ""Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,"" Kennedy said. ""NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are — what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?"" Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts. COVID vaccines and pregnancy Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for childre n and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said ""study after study shows adverse events"" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed ""27 adverse events during pregnancy."" Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however, recently reiterated that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals. ""We're not depriving anybody of choice,"" Kennedy said. ""If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation."" ""Not true,"" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. ""We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true."" House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it ""extremely alarming"" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations ""without consulting the customary panel of experts."" ""You have lied to the American people"" In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of ""lying"" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel. ""But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,"" Schrier said. ""Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?"" Kennedy responded by saying he ""never made that agreement."" ""So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?"" Schrier said. ""If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,"" Kennedy said. ""It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,"" Schrier said. ""I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,"" Kennedy responded. ""Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,"" Schrier said. Republicans praise Kennedy Some Republicans referred to Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" or ""MAHA"" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, ""I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again."" Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his ""commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs."" Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue ""gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures."" Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: ""I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day."" During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it ""crashes through the red tape""; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors ; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August. ""We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,"" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors. United States Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

Whether you find yourself in need of extra funding to cover a family vacation, pay for fall college tuition costs or finance major home improvement projects , your home equity could be the viable and inexpensive funding source you need right now. But with the home in question functioning as collateral and, thus, the threat of foreclosure high, you'll want to use your equity in as safe and as strategic a way as possible. By doing so, you can potentially improve your overall financial health at the same time. On the other hand, making the wrong decisions could worsen your financial standing to a significant degree. So it's important to make the right home equity loan moves this summer. But what, exactly, are those? While these could vary based on the homeowner and your budget, we gathered a list of broadly applicable moves that many homeowners should consider making now. Start by seeing how much home equity you could borrow from here . Home equity loan moves homeowners should make this summer Here are three timely (and strategic) home equity loan moves owners may want to consider making this summer: Understand the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC A home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may operate similarly and sound the same, but they're not identical. For starters, the loan disburses the equity in a single lump sum, and it comes with a fixed interest rate for borrowers. HELOCs, on the other hand, function as a revolving line of credit that utilizes variable interest rates. Currently, the average rate on each is primarily the same (home equity loans at 8.27% versus 8.25% for HELOCs), but thanks to that variable rate, that similarity may not last much longer, especially if rate cuts are issued this summer. Take the time, then, to understand the differences, as it will better inform your decision-making and allow you to appropriately choose an option that matches your financial needs and budget. Compare your home equity loan and HELOC rate offers here to learn more . Shop around for rates and terms The above rates are averages, meaning that if you have a good credit score , you may be able to find a rate somewhat lower. So, just like you would with other borrowing products, it's worth taking the time to shop around for rates and lenders now, especially when considering the potential for rate cuts to be issued later this year. As that becomes more of a reality, lenders may start cutting their rate offers in advance. And, remember that you don't need to use your current mortgage lender to borrow equity (although you may want to see if they can beat any offer you get from a competitor before formally applying). Use it for financially sound purposes Sure, that summer vacation may come with a hefty price tag that can easily be covered by the average $300,000-plus home equity level many homeowners enjoy right now. But should it? You should always utilize your home equity for smart reasons that can improve your financial standing (like paying off high-rate credit card debt ) and avoid uses that can hurt it (like paying for a vacation). This money is coming from your most prized financial asset, so it must be used wisely, no matter the seasonal temptations to spend it otherwise. The bottom line Your home doesn't just need to be the place where you live and sleep; it can also be an important financial source for a variety of expenses. But it will need to be used strategically, especially when borrowing from it in the unique economic climate of summer 2025. By making these above moves now, you'll improve your chances of equity borrowing success both this season and for the months and, potentially, years still ahead.",2025-06-24T17:15:33.700015

Jesus Sarmiento, who had nearly 80,000 followers on TikTok, was murdered over the weekend by armed men who broke into the residence where he was staying. In the video shared on social media, a woman banging on a door and screaming for help can be heard in the background. ""They shot me, they shot me,"" Sarmiento says, as blood is visible on the floor. Two armed men appear briefly before the stream ends. ""Attorney General Tarek William Saab announces that the Public Prosecutor's Office... has been tasked with investigating, identifying, and punishing those responsible for the assassination of Jesus Sarmiento,"" the prosecutor's office announced on Instagram on Monday. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Fiscal General de Venezuela 🇻🇪 (@mpublicove) Sarmiento had ""denounced the threats he was receiving from members of GEDOS (Structured Organized Crime Group) and alleged police officers,"" the prosecutor's office said in a statement. In his TikTok posts, Sarmiento spoke about the leader of the Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero, who is one of the country's most wanted criminals known by the alias ""Nino Guerrero."" The U.S. State Department has offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction. The Venezuelan government has maintained that the Tren de Aragua — which the U.S. considers a ""terrorist"" organization — has already been dismantled and denies its existence. Sarmiento shared photos and videos of alleged members of the gang and denounced the ""extortion"" by police officers. ""I was kidnapped by... DAET — the police's Directorate of Strategic and Tactical Actions,"" he stated in one of his final videos. ""We are overrun with delinquent officials who work with common criminals,"" he added. Sarmiento's murder marks the latest in a string of deadly attacks on popular social media figures. Earlier this month, Pakistani police said 17-year-old TikTok star Sana Yousaf was shot dead by a man who had repeatedly contacted her online. And last month, the murder of a young influencer during a livestream in Jalisco, in western Mexico, shocked the country. Authorities insisted there was no ""evidence"" that the murder of 23-year-old Valeria Márquez was linked to organized crime, and prosecutors opened an investigation for ""femicide.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jury-orders-man-pay-500000-assault-capitol-riot-police-officer-died-suicide/,U.S.,2025-06-24T06:36:20-0400,"Jury orders man to pay $500,000 for assaulting D.C. police officer who died by suicide after Capitol riot",18,792,17,3,"Police officer's widow advocates for change after husband's Jan. 6-related suicide 09:48 A federal jury on Monday awarded $500,000 to the widow and estate of a police officer who died by suicide nine days after he helped defend the U.S. Capitol from a mob of rioters, including a man who scuffled with the officer during the attack. The eight-member jury ordered that man, 69-year-old chiropractor David Walls-Kaufman, to pay $380,000 in punitive damages and $60,000 in compensatory damages to Erin Smith for assaulting her husband, Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith , inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. They awarded an additional $60,000 to compensate Jeffrey Smith's estate for his pain and suffering. The judge presiding over the civil trial dismissed Erin Smith's wrongful-death claim against Walls-Kaufman before jurors began deliberating last week. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes said no reasonable juror could conclude that Walls-Kaufman's actions were capable of causing a traumatic brain injury leading to Smith's death. Walls-Kaufman, who lived a few blocks from the Capitol, denied assaulting Smith. He says any injuries that the officer suffered on Jan. 6 occurred later in the day, when another rioter threw a pole that struck Smith around his head. On Friday, the jury sided with Erin Smith and held Walls-Kaufman liable for assaulting her 35-year-old husband — an encounter captured on the officer's body camera. ""Erin is grateful to receive some measure of justice,"" said David P. Weber, one of her attorneys. Walls-Kaufman said the outcome of the trial is ""absolutely ridiculous."" ""No crime happened. I never struck the officer. I never intended to strike the officer,"" he said. ""I'm just stunned."" After the jury left the courtroom, Reyes encouraged the parties to confer and discuss a possible settlement to avoid the time and expense of an appeal and for the sake of ""finality."" ""You guys settle, you can move on with your lives,"" the judge said. Walls-Kaufman's attorney, Hughie Hunt, described the jury's award as ""shocking."" ""We're talking about a three-second event,"" he told the judge. ""It's not shocking, Mr. Hunt. A lot of things can happen in three seconds,"" Reyes replied. Jeffrey Smith was driving to work for the first time after the Capitol riot when he shot himself with his service weapon. His family said he had no history of mental health problems before the Jan. 6 riot. Erin Smith claims Walls-Kaufman struck her husband in the head with his own police baton, giving him a concussion and causing psychological and physical trauma that led to his suicide. ""I think the physical attack on him changed him,"" in 2022. ""If he didn't go to work that day, he'd still be here."" Undated: Erin and Jeffrey Smith Jack Reznicki, photo provided by Erin Smith The police department medically evaluated Smith and cleared him to return to full duty before he died by suicide. In 2022, the District of Columbia Police and Firefighters' Retirement and Relief Board determined that Smith was injured in the line of duty and the injury was the ""sole and direct cause of his death,"" according to the lawsuit. Walls-Kaufman served a 60-day prison sentence after pleading guilty to a Capitol riot-related misdemeanor in January 2023, but he was pardoned in January. On his first day back in the White House, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted prison sentences or ordered the dismissal of cases for all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in the attack. More than 100 law-enforcement officers were injured during the riot. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick collapsed and died a day after engaging with the rioters. A medical examiner later determined he suffered a stroke and died of natural causes. Howard Liebengood , a Capitol police officer who responded to the riot, also died by suicide after the attack. Erin Smith's quest isn't over. She applied for the National Law Enforcement Memorial to add her husband's name as a line-of-duty death. Weber said they're hoping for a decision soon.

Here are 3 questions from experts.,15,998,20,7,"Wealth management expert on market uncertainty | On Your Side 03:56 Watching your 401(k) plan savings recede as stocks slide can be gut-wrenching, sparking anxiety about whether you'll ever be able to retire — a particularly loaded issue for Gen Xers, given the oldest members of the generation are hitting 60 this year. But financial experts say it's important not to panic in the face of plunging markets or rising recession risks because that can lead to rash decisions that cost you money. Instead, it's important to focus on some key investment questions before taking action, they say. Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, President Trump's tariff barrage has spooked investors and soured consumers on the economy, with many fearing that his trade policies will trigger inflation and slam economic growth. The S&P 500 last week briefly moved into so-called ""correction"" territory , meaning the index had tumbled 10% from its most recent high, although it regained some ground on Friday. The downdraft in stocks is causing angst among people saving for retirement, experts say. ""First of all, you aren't alone — a lot of people are panicking,"" TIAA wealth management director Doug Ornstein told CBS MoneyWatch. ""Don't overreact, but it might be appropriate to take some action."" The market turmoil comes as many employees already feel behind the curve, with 7 in 10 workers saying they believe they could work until they retire and still not have enough money to fund their golden years, according to a new Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies report . ""Everyone is navigating difficult waters right now and trying to understand what the effects of market volatility will be on their overall retirement savings,"" noted Catherine Collinson, CEO and president of the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies. ""One thing they should be doing, but many aren't, is engaging in the basics."" Here are some key questions that experts recommend you consider before making changes to your retirement account. What is your appetite for risk? It's easy to think you've got a high tolerance for risk when stocks are in a bull market, as they've been for the last few years. But the current market turmoil may be a sign that that you're more cautious than you thought, experts say. Risk tolerance is sometimes assessed in a quiz (such as this one from Vanguard) that asks hypothetical questions about your approach towards investing, such as whether you might sell a bond if it lost money in a short period of time. ""How do I think about risk, and how do I feel about risk emotionally and psychologically — all of that is completely valid to consider,"" TIAA's Ornstein said. But it's also important to consider your risk capacity, which involves a more complicated calculation including data such as your age and your retirement horizon. That offers a more objective way to assess risk than your emotional reaction to losing money on investment. ""Both things are really important: How you feel about risk, and what resources do you have"" to manage that risk, he noted. Is your time horizon really what you think it is? Workers often think about their investment horizon as the number of years they have left in the workforce, which might seem daunting to a Gen Xer who is getting closer to retirement. But the truth, which might not be intuitive to some workers, is that this timeframe is likely much longer than you expect, Ornstein said. ""Let's say someone is 60 and plans to retire at 67 — they don't have a lot of time for the market to recover"" before they retire, he noted. ""But if you retire at 67 and live to 95, most of your money will probably remain invested for next 20, 25, 30 years."" He added, ""We'll see a lot of ups and downs, bull and bear markets, presidential administrations, and economic cycles over the next 20 to 30 years, so what is happening right now shouldn't dictate a massive change."" In other words, someone whose retirement is just a few years away might have an actual investment time horizon of 30 years, which means sticking to their financial plan. More generally, trying to time the market, or trading individual stocks in an effort to capture gains and avoid losses, is almost impossible and typically leads to financial losses and lost opportunities, considerable research has found . Is your investment portfolio sufficiently diversified? Although it's important not to overreact when markets are rocky, rebalancing your investments can be a good idea is such periods, Ornstein said. ""Buy and hold works well when the market is just going up and up,"" he said. When markets head south, ""It may be a good time to consider rebalancing into a more diversified mix of investments."" For instance, that means not only checking your mix of equities and fixed income, but also your mix of sub-asset classes within those categories. Adding international stocks, for instance, on top of your S&P 500 index fund could help spread the risk, as well as considering different types of fixed income investments aside from Treasuries. And don't forget to tend to your emergency savings, given that having a cash buffer can help in times of financial stress and keep you from raiding your retirement account, noted Transamerica's Collinson. Her group's research found that 37% of workers have tapped their retirement accounts, suggesting that many people use their 401(k)s as an emergency fund. Workers can ask their employers to set aside a portion of their paycheck in another bank account that they earmark for emergency savings. Some employers also are starting to enroll workers in accounts specifically designed for emergencies , a change that was enabled by the Secure 2.0 retirement law. ""The research indicates many workers lack adequate emergency savings,"" she said. ""Now is the time to find out how to build that up."" Stock Market",2025-06-24T17:15:38.644703

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-cbs-news-opinion-poll/,Entertainment,2025-06-24T17:58:09-0400,"Poll finds U.S. strikes on Iran backed by Republicans, disapproval overall; most say Trump needs Congress' OK",17,637,23,6,"Details on canceled security briefings over Trump's Iran strikes 03:30 As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities , at least three things are in play. One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:15:41.867124

He was 81. His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram : ""Bobby left this world holding my hand — just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light."" Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year. American singer and teen idol Bobby Sherman, circa 1970. Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of ""TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols."" He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s. Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart — ""Little Woman,"" ""Julie, Do Ya Love Me,"" ""Easy Come, Easy Go,"" and ""La La La (If I Had You)."" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including ""Here Comes Bobby,"" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show ""Shindig!"" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series — ""Here Come the Brides"" (1968-70) and ""Getting Together"" (1971). After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times."" Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band. ""I was brought up in a fairly strict family,"" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. ""Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous."" Singer Bobby Sherman at a recording session in Los Angeles, March 13, 1967. He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda , Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with ""Shindig!"" Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in ""Here Come the Brides,"" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, ""Seattle,"" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons. Following the series, Sherman starred in ""Getting Together,"" a spinoff of ""The Partridge Family,"" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, ""Little Woman,"" earned a gold record in 1969. ""While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,"" The Tulsa World said in 1997. His movies included ""Wild In Streets,"" ""He is My Brother"" and ""Get Crazy."" Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: ""I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was."" Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross. ""If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times. ""I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody."" In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations. In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. ""When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the ""Twice a Citizen"" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: ""Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America."" Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era ""Teen Idols Tour"" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: ""Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.""

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.

As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said the mission ""opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.""

The 32-year-old from Seattle was found unresponsive at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Los Angeles, according to a statement from the Bureau of Prisons. Responding employees initiated life-saving measures, and emergency medical services transported Park to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, the bureau said. His cause of death wasn't immediately clear, and the FBI and U.S. Marshals Service have been notified. No employees or other incarcerated individuals were injured, the bureau said. Park, a U.S. citizen, had arrived at the L.A. detention center on June 13, after he was indicted for alleged malicious destruction of property. He was apprehended in Poland earlier this month after flying to Warsaw a few days after the bombing outside American Reproductive Centers fertility clinic on May 17 . He was accused of shipping approximately 180 pounds of ammonium nitrate — commonly used as a precursor to construct homemade explosives — to the bomber, who was identified by officials as 25-year-old Guy Bartkus. Bartkus died in the blast outside the fertility clinic. ""Make no mistake, this is an intentional act of terrorism,"" Akil Davis, assistant director in charge of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said at a news briefing after the blast. Prosecutors said evidence showed that Park and Bartkus shared nihilist beliefs. The criminal complaint filed against Park alleged the attack ""was motivated by his pro-mortalism, anti-natalism, and anti-pro-life ideology, which is the belief that individuals should not be born without their consent and that non-existence is best.""

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

Scheffler was flawless when he had to be on the back nine of Quail Hollow, leaving the blunders to Jon Rahm and everyone else trying to catch him on a final day that turned tense until Scheffler pulled away with a steady diet of fairways and greens. ""This back nine will be one that I remember for a long time,"" Scheffler said. ""It was a grind out there. I think at one point on the front I maybe had a four- or five-shot lead, and making the turn, I think I was tied for the lead. ""So to step up when I needed to the most, I'll remember that for a while."" He closed with a bogey he could afford for an even-par 71, giving him a five-shot victory and his third major title. Scheffler became the first player since Seve Ballesteros to win his first three majors by three shots or more. Scottie Scheffler holds the Wanamaker trophy after winning the PGA Championship golf tournament at the Quail Hollow Club, Sunday, May 18, 2025, in Charlotte, N.C. David J. Phillip / AP The margin doesn't match up with the grind. That much was clear when Scheffler raised his arms on the 18th green and then ferociously slammed his cap to the turf, a brand of emotion rarely seen by the 28-year-old Texas star. Scheffler was five shots ahead coming to the last hole when he won his first Masters green jacket in 2022. He was four shots clear of the field when he won at Augusta National last year. And he had a six-shot lead at Quail Hollow. But this sure didn't feel like a walk in the park. He had a five-shot lead standing on the sixth tee. But with a shaky swing that led to two bogeys, and with Rahm making three birdies in a four-hole stretch around the turn, they were tied when Scheffler got to the 10th tee. It looked like a duel to the finish, with Bryson DeChambeau doing all he could to get in the mix. Under the most pressure he felt all day, Scheffler didn't miss a shot off the tee or from the fairway until his lead back to four shots. Rahm wound up seven shots behind, but the two-time major champion was the only serious threat. His chances began to fade when he failed to birdie the 14th and 15th holes, the two easiest holes on the back nine and the last good scoring chances. His 5-wood on the reachable par-4 14th was a yard from being perfect, instead going into the bunker. He blasted out weakly and his 7-foot birdie putt never had a chance. He drilled a 345-yard drive on the par-5 15th and his 4-iron went just over the back. Rahm putted it too hard and it rolled 12 feet. He missed that birdie putt and then came unglued. A bogey on the 16th hole went he went from rough to bunker. Having to take on a dangerous pin at the par-3 17th, it bounded over the sunbaked green into the water for double bogey. And his last tee shot went left off the grassy bank and into the stream for another double bogey. All that work to make up a five-shot deficit at the start of the day and Rahm closed with a 73 to tie for eighth. ""Yeah, the last three holes, it's a tough pill to swallow right now,"" said Rahm, his first time seriously contending in a major since he left for the Saudi riches of LIV Golf two years ago. ""I'll get over it. I'll move on,"" Rahm said. ""Again, there's a lot more positive than negative to think about this week. I'm really happy I put myself in position and hopefully learn from this and give it another go in the U.S. Open."" DeChambeau birdied the 14th and 15th to get within two shots, but he never had another good look at birdie and bogeyed the 18th for a 70. He tied for second with Harris English (65) and Davis Riley, who overcame a triple bogey on No. 7 to play bogey-free the rest of the way and salvaged a 72. ""I'm baffled right now. Just felt like things just didn't go my way this week,"" DeChambeau said. ""I drove it as good as I can. ... I gave myself a good chance. I just felt like a couple breaks went a different way."" J.T. Poston, the North Carolina native who also flirted with an outside chance, bogeyed the last two holes for a 73 to tie for fifth. English finished his Sunday-best score as Scheffler was making his way down the third hole. He had a flight to catch that afternoon. He also was the clubhouse leader. But he looked at Scheffler's name atop the leaderboard and said with a smile, ""I don't see him slipping a whole lot. I see myself catching my flight."" But then Scheffler unable to find his swing. He hit only two fairway on the front nine. He failed to convert birdies on the par-5 seventh and the reachable par-4 eighth. On eight of his nine holes, his miss was to the left. And he was tied with the red-hot Rahm. But part of Scheffler's greatness is his ability to wear down a field, which he did at the Masters both times he won. ""I hit the important shots well this week, and that's why I'm walking away with the trophy,"" Scheffler said. He finished at 11-under 273 and picked up his 15th victory in just his sixth year on the PGA Tour. Dating to 1950, Scheffler is the third-fastest player to go from one to 15 tour wins, behind only Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus, and even then by a matter of months. His victory comes a month after Rory McIlroy captured the Masters to complete the career Grand Slam. The PGA Championship was always going to be a tough act to follow and it didn't come close in terms of drama. But it served as a reminder why Scheffler has been No. 1 for two straight years, and why it will take a lot to replace him. McIlroy made the cut on the number, shot 72-72 on the weekend and tied for 47th. It was his lowest 72-hole finish in four years in the majors. McIlroy declined all four days to speak to the media. Scheffler came into the PGA Championship off an eight-shot victory in the CJ Cup Byron Nelson. And then he won a major by five. It was the first time since Woods in 2000 that a player won consecutive PGA Tour starts by five shots or more in the same season.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dei-diversity-equity-inclusion-corporate-programs/,MoneyWatch,2025-01-28T17:19:32-0500,"What has DEI — diversity, equity and inclusion — done for U.S. workers and employers?",15,1249,21,6,"What is DEI and why is it facing pushback? 02:42 President Trump's executive order banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs across the U.S. government is renewing debate over what DEI is and whether it has benefited workers and companies. DEI has its roots in the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which barred employment discrimination based on race, color, sex, religion and other criteria. In the following decades, a range of policies have sought to root out bias in hiring, promote fairness in the workplace and open career pathways for people of color and for women, while also expanding to include sexual orientation and gender identity. This push gained momentum after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, as politicians and social activists pressed companies to do their part in confronting systemic racism. But Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 order , issued on his first day back in office, criticized DEI as ""illegal and immoral,"" while the following day a memo from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management called for all federal DEI employees to be placed on leave . What is DEI in the workplace? DEI is often misperceived as focusing only on race, according to DEI experts. But such initiatives comprise many practices that aim to uplift different marginalized groups in the workplace. For example, a policy that accommodates working parents, such as flexible work hours, could qualify as DEI. So could establishing affinity groups based on shared identities, like sexual orientation. Many critics of DEI say employer hiring and promotion decisions should be based on merit alone without regard to race, color, gender and other categories. Other opponents of the policies go further, arguing that DEI itself promotes racism. But DEI defenders say that policies that seek to foster diversity and inclusion within organizations aren't in conflict with those that seek to reward the most talented or hardest-working employees. ""DEI enhances merit by saying, 'How do we find the best people for the job or make sure we are promoting the best people?'"" David Glasgow, executive director of the Meltzer Center for Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at NYU School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""And that means thinking about barriers and biases that might be getting in the way of considering the full talent pool."" In defining DEI, Glasgow described ""diversity"" as a commitment to diversifying personnel within an institution so that U.S. workplaces better represent the population at large. ""It's about engaging in effective outreach to places that might be overlooked and making sure hiring and promotion systems aren't screening out women or people of color from being considered,"" he said. Meanwhile, when designed and implemented effectively, DEI programs are not discriminatory, according to Jessica Fulton, vice president of Policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit that aims to improve African-Americans' socioeconomic status. ""These policies don't actually dictate who gets hired. They are ways to open doors to people who might not have access or aren't as well-connected in an industry or occupation,"" she explained. All federal DEI employees placed on leave 02:13 The equity piece of DEI seeks to level the playing field for groups of workers who have historically been underrepresented in a given field or who, compared with their white or male peers, are underpaid for doing the same work. ""It could mean making sure women are able to enter traditionally male-dominated occupations, like construction or technology,"" Fulton said. ""It's about addressing issues around equal pay for equal work, making sure people feel safe in the workplace so they don't feel discrimination when they come to work, because workers who don't feel safe are not the most productive."" Corporations also commonly aim to develop inclusion policies that help people from diverse backgrounds feel safe within a given workplace and its culture, she explained. They are intended to be, and often are, inclusive of everyone and not just members of marginalized communities, according to Fulton. ""It is also making sure they can put certain policies in place to make sure their workers stick around and keep working. It is about building a great team and being able to treat that team well and retain the folks they hire,"" Fulton said. Given the recent backlash against DEI, though, a number of corporations are moving away from such inclusion policies, noting that they could pose a legal risk. That's after many major U.S. employers already ditched their DEI programs in response to pressure from anti-diversity activists. Among them are Ford, Harley Davidson , McDonald's, Meta and more. How is success measured? Many corporate executives have soured on DEI in recent years because of the perception that such policies don't enhance a company's performance, said Daniel Snell, co-founder of Arrival, a UK-based consulting firm focused on corporate leadership and culture. Other leaders, while recognizing the value of promoting diversity and inclusion, argue that DEI is inadequate for redressing what are at bottom much broader socioeconomic issues. Glasgow of NYU Law concedes that it can be hard to determine if DEI programs are succeeding or otherwise clearly assess their outcomes. ""It's difficult to measure certain DEI interventions, like the effectiveness of implicit bias training in the workplace,"" he said. ""It also depends on what you are trying to achieve."" One tool employers use to try to gauge the efficacy of DEI policies are internal surveys that ask workers whether they feel like they can be themselves in the office, believe they are respected by their peers, and feel that their opinions matter. When it comes to a company's mentorship and promotion policies, employers will also monitor if members of a particular group of workers, such as veterans and Black employees, are quitting shortly after being hired — patterns that can yield insights into a workplace's equity and inclusiveness. By contrast, if over time more women or people of color ascend to leadership positions, that could be viewed as a company achieving its goal of building a workplace that's more representative of its job applicant pool. Sweeping changes to companies DEI efforts impact local businesses 02:06 Corporate DEI programs aren't altruistic, experts emphasize, pointing to at least some empirical evidence showing that such efforts can help companies adapt to change, support innovation and even boost the bottom line. ""The point of diversity and inclusion is that companies, the government, universities, all do better when there are diverse participants in management and throughout the enterprise,"" said Michael Posner, director of the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights. ""The objective of this is not to set quotas or say we are going to take unqualified people because they fit a certain characteristic, like gender or race, but to create opportunity and try to overcome historic barriers to entry."" In one noted study , McKinsey found that companies in the top quartile for the gender diversity of their boards of director are 27% more likely to outperform financially than those in the bottom quartile. In separate research , the consulting firm in 2024 found that women's representation at work over the past decade has increased at every level of corporate management — women today make up 29% of C-suite level positions, up from 17% in 2015. ""[A] lot of the language and framing right now of DEI as illegal and discriminatory obscures who it's really for, which is all of us, and to the benefit of companies,"" Fulton told CBS MoneyWatch.

After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary. ""A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'"" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. ""And I don't think I'd change a thing — except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times."" Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band. ""I was brought up in a fairly strict family,"" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. ""Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous."" Singer Bobby Sherman at a recording session in Los Angeles, March 13, 1967. He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda , Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with ""Shindig!"" Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in ""Here Come the Brides,"" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, ""Seattle,"" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons. Following the series, Sherman starred in ""Getting Together,"" a spinoff of ""The Partridge Family,"" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, ""Little Woman,"" earned a gold record in 1969. ""While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,"" The Tulsa World said in 1997. His movies included ""Wild In Streets,"" ""He is My Brother"" and ""Get Crazy."" Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: ""I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was."" Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross. ""If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times. ""I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody."" In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations. In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. ""When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997. He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the ""Twice a Citizen"" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation. In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: ""Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America."" Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era ""Teen Idols Tour"" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits. The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: ""Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group."" Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need. He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife. Music Entertainment",2025-06-24T17:15:56.650580

One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:15:58.284236

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops. The Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible. Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:15:59.901319

Alessandro Coatti , 42, worked for Britain's Royal Society of Biology as a science policy officer whose job included giving evidence to parliament, before leaving that post in 2024 to travel in South America. Part of his body was found in a suitcase on a riverbank on April 6. Other remains were later found in other locations. Coatti had arrived in Santa Marta, a city that acts as a gateway to idyllic palm-lined Caribbean beaches and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountain range, as a tourist. The police said he was lured by a gang that planned to rob him to an abandoned house in the city, through a dating app for the LGBTQ community. Scientist Alessandro Coatti was reported missing in Santa Marta, Colombia, on April 5, 2025. Royal Society of Biology El Tiempo quoted a local hotel worker as saying Coatti was conducting research on local animal species and had asked about visiting the village of Minca, about six miles southeast of Santa Marta. Santa Marta's Mayor Carlos Pinedo said Sunday that four people suspected of his murder and dismemberment had been arrested in raids in the Colombian capital Bogota, the second city of Medellin as well as in Santa Marta and the town of Arjona, near the port city of Cartagena. At a press conference on Monday , Santa Marta police chief Colonel Jaime Rios said that the police had received a tip-off, which led them to a house where traces of blood were found. ""Through arduous investigative work, interviews were conducted, biological traces belonging to the victim were collected, and security camera footage was analyzed, which were all key to solving the case,"" he said. The gruesome killing of Coatti, described by colleagues at the Royal Society of Biology as a respected scientist, caused shock in Colombia. ""He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organizing events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,"" the RSB said in a statement after Coatti's death. ""Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with, and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him."" Pinedo had offered a reward of $12,000 for information leading to the capture of his killers. Rios said the reward had led to the breakthrough in the investigation. The Sierra Nevada mountains are home to a drug-running paramilitary gang known as the ""Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada."" It is not known if they had any hand in Coatti's murder, but they have been linked to the murder and dismemberment of others in recent years. Colombia Italy Murder",2025-06-24T17:16:08.022401

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one."" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",2025-06-24T17:16:11.271793

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. ""The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29."" Jerome Powell Interest Rates Federal Reserve",2025-06-24T17:16:16.190681

The woman is the only known carrier of a new blood type, dubbed ""Gwada negative,"" the French Blood Establishment (EFS) said. The discovery was made 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from a patient who was undergoing routine tests ahead of a surgery. ""The EFS has just discovered the 48th blood group system in the world!"" the agency said in a statement on social network LinkedIn , adding that the discovery was officially recognized by the International Society of Blood Transfusion in early June. The scientific association had until now recognized 47 blood group systems . Scientists were finally able to unravel the mystery in 2019 thanks to ""high-throughput DNA sequencing"", which highlighted a genetic mutation, Peyrard said. The patient, who was 54 at the time and lived in Paris, was undergoing routine tests before surgery when the unknown antibody was detected, Peyrard said. This woman ""is undoubtedly the only known case in the world,"" he said, adding: ""She is the only person in the world who is compatible with herself."" The medical biologist said the woman inherited the blood type from her father and mother, who each had the mutated gene. The name ""Gwada negative"", which refers to the patient's origins and ""sounds good in all languages"", has been popular with the experts, said Peyrard. The ABO blood group system was first discovered in the early 1900s. Thanks to DNA sequencing, the discovery of new blood groups has accelerated in recent years. Peyrard and colleagues are now hoping to find other people with the same blood group.

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community.""

In today's economic climate, in which inflation just ticked up, interest rates are frozen at a high level and market predictions are all over the place, it can be daunting to think about where to keep your money short-term, let alone over a multiple-year time frame. But for savers, that's exactly what they should be contemplating, especially for larger, five-figure deposit amounts. And with a certificate of deposit (CD) account , they have the perfect vehicle for protecting and growing their money. CD interest rates remain high in today's economy (albeit slightly lower than they were in 2023 and 2024). As such, they're a smart place to park a large, $10,000 deposit now. And with rates on long-term CDs (which have maturity dates past the one-year mark), there's a compelling case for transferring (and leaving) your money into one of these accounts now, particularly if you do so with a 2-year CD. But is a $10,000 2-year CD account worth opening now, at the start of summer 2025? Below, we'll detail why it may still be. Start by seeing how much interest you could be earning with a high-rate CD here . $10,000 2-year CD accounts: Here's why they're worth opening now A $10,000 2-year CD account will require some discipline on behalf of savers to avoid having to pay an early withdrawal penalty . But if you can manage to ""set it and forget it,"" it could be a valuable decision now. Here's why: You'll earn more than $800 in interest There are exceedingly few options where you can invest your money and be guaranteed a return of close to $1,000, but that's exactly what you'll get with a 2-year CD now if you deposit $10,000 into it. With little effort on behalf of the saver, you'll stand to earn $849.31 after two years (tied to a 4.16% interest rate). That's more than $1 per day, every day, for two years, earned by just transferring a portion of your money into a 2-year CD account with this rate. The only work you'll need to spend time doing? Shopping around online to find an account with the highest rates and optimal terms. Start shopping for CD accounts online today . You'll secure long-term protection against market volatility Stock market uncertainty is high right now, and there's no way to tell when (or if) it will be regulated. This is likely already having an impact on your investments and savings so it makes sense to reduce the negative effect as much as possible. A five-figure deposit into a 2-year CD can be the solution. By putting $10,000 into a CD of this length, you'll lock in long-term protection against market volatility, no matter what happens with inflation, interest rates and the stock market during those 24 months. This is always a nice feature for CD account holders, but it's a particularly timely and beneficial one right now. It'll give you time to think about your long-term financial goals Savers (and borrowers) have had a lot to contend with over the past few years, ranging from when interest rates and borrowing costs were low to when they soared to when they started to fall again . This can lead to a continuous evaluation of where to keep your money (and where not to), which can be exhausting and stressful. But with a good portion of your money protected in a 2-year CD, you'll gain something you haven't had in quite some time: time to think about your long-term financial goals. This will allow you to take a step back to truly determine what is and isn't working for your money. Sure, you may lose access to $10,000 for this time, but it could be worth if it means having time to make the best financial decisions for your money. The bottom line A $10,000 2-year CD will require some sacrifice on behalf of savers but, for many, the return could be more than worth it. With the potential to earn $800 (or more) on their money, long-term protection against market volatility and the time (finally) to think about their long-term financial goals in peace, this account type in this amount has multiple advantages. So consider making a move now, while rates are still high and the need for protection is still strong. You'll be happy you did so when the account matures in June 2027.",2025-06-24T17:16:21.069200

Here's how long it will last.",21,927,20,10,"How to handle the dangerous heat wave scorching the Northeast 02:00 The worst heat is likely to peak for cities in the Northeast on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. ""A large portion of the region will see high temperatures ranging between 98 and 101 degrees,"" the agency said , with ""numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures"" expected through at least Wednesday. ""Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,"" the weather service warned. A key measurement of the strength of the ridge of high pressure broke a record Monday , according to the NWS. It was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. More than 160 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rose to about 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain. Map shows areas under a heat alert Tuesday, June 24. Here's what to know about the heat wave and how to stay safe. Heat wave forecast maps ""Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming in HOT,"" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings ""with oppressive humidity."" The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity. Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. The heat index in Philadelphia topped out at 108 on Monday. Meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome — an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity — sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality. The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say. ""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said. These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures. High temperature forecast for Tuesday, June 24. High temperature forecast for Wednesday, June 25. How long will the heat wave last? The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday. Parts of the Northeast face a ""High Risk"" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. ""The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon."" What constitutes a heat wave? A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly. Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down. ""Your body needs a reprieve,"" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. ""You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit."" When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, ""You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality."" Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S. How to stay safe during a heat wave Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended . You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty. It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say .

But in the Navajo Nation, a solution to curbing the now national epidemic is emerging. The sexually transmitted infection can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Syphilis cases skyrocketed in the U.S. as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's STD prevention budget dropped, data shows. In 2003, the budget was around $169 million and there were about 34,000 cases in the U.S. In 2023, the budget was roughly $80 million and there were about 209,000 cases nationwide. On Tuesday, the Trump administration began layoffs across multiple federal health agencies including the CDC. While it's unclear exactly how the cuts will impact STD programs, the CDC's National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention is affected, in addition to programs for reproductive health, maternal and child health, and HIV. Syphilis cases skyrocketed in the U.S. as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's STD prevention budget dropped, data shows. Grace Manthey Rates of congenital syphilis, when babies get the infection from their mothers during pregnancy, have increased 10-fold nationally in the last decade, according to CDC data, and the rate for Indigenous babies is 8-times higher than those born to White mothers. Congenital syphilis may cause stillbirth, miscarriages, vision or hearing loss, intellectual disability and more. Most of these cases could be prevented with early testing and treatment during pregnancy. Health officials in the vast Indian reservations of the Southwest are fighting sexually transmitted infections with a unique program that meets patients where they are to provide treatment.

Alessandro Coatti , 42, worked for Britain's Royal Society of Biology as a science policy officer whose job included giving evidence to parliament, before leaving that post in 2024 to travel in South America. Part of his body was found in a suitcase on a riverbank on April 6. Other remains were later found in other locations. Coatti had arrived in Santa Marta, a city that acts as a gateway to idyllic palm-lined Caribbean beaches and the snow-capped Sierra Nevada mountain range, as a tourist. The police said he was lured by a gang that planned to rob him to an abandoned house in the city, through a dating app for the LGBTQ community. Scientist Alessandro Coatti was reported missing in Santa Marta, Colombia, on April 5, 2025. Royal Society of Biology El Tiempo quoted a local hotel worker as saying Coatti was conducting research on local animal species and had asked about visiting the village of Minca, about six miles southeast of Santa Marta. Santa Marta's Mayor Carlos Pinedo said Sunday that four people suspected of his murder and dismemberment had been arrested in raids in the Colombian capital Bogota, the second city of Medellin as well as in Santa Marta and the town of Arjona, near the port city of Cartagena. At a press conference on Monday , Santa Marta police chief Colonel Jaime Rios said that the police had received a tip-off, which led them to a house where traces of blood were found. ""Through arduous investigative work, interviews were conducted, biological traces belonging to the victim were collected, and security camera footage was analyzed, which were all key to solving the case,"" he said. The gruesome killing of Coatti, described by colleagues at the Royal Society of Biology as a respected scientist, caused shock in Colombia. ""He was a passionate and dedicated scientist, leading RSB animal science work, writing numerous submissions, organizing events and giving evidence in the House of Commons,"" the RSB said in a statement after Coatti's death. ""Ale was funny, warm, intelligent, loved by everyone he worked with, and will be deeply missed by all who knew and worked with him."" Pinedo had offered a reward of $12,000 for information leading to the capture of his killers. Rios said the reward had led to the breakthrough in the investigation. The Sierra Nevada mountains are home to a drug-running paramilitary gang known as the ""Conquistadors of the Sierra Nevada."" It is not known if they had any hand in Coatti's murder, but they have been linked to the murder and dismemberment of others in recent years. Colombia Italy Murder",2025-06-24T17:16:25.924310

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

Video shows the explosion, which SpaceX said occurred as the Starship was preparing for an engine test firing. The Starship ""experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" the company said in a post on X . ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,"" SpaceX said. The company said there are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities and asked that people avoid the area ""while safing operations continue."" Video from LabPadre, the company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, appears to show two major explosions — the first near the rocket's nose, and the second on the left side of the spacecraft. The Starship was being filled with liquid oxygen and high-energy methane fuel at the time the detonations happened. The explosion may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday. Starship is comprised of a spacecraft and a Super Heavy rocket that together are intended to be a reusable system that can carry cargo and crew to the moon and Mars. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch astronauts on a mission to land near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights over the last two years, with the first three ending with explosions or breakups and the next three being partially successful. The next two resulted in explosions and the most recent flight, in May, reached its trajectory but broke up during atmospheric entry after spinning out of control. Known as Ship 36, SpaceX was planning to launch the Starship around the end of this month on a huge Super Heavy booster, in what would have been the rocket's 10th test fight.

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety. While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings. In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse. In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head."" According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America. This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire . On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities."" Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back.""

Here's how long it will last.",21,927,20,10,"How to handle the dangerous heat wave scorching the Northeast 02:00 The worst heat is likely to peak for cities in the Northeast on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. ""A large portion of the region will see high temperatures ranging between 98 and 101 degrees,"" the agency said , with ""numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures"" expected through at least Wednesday. ""Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,"" the weather service warned. A key measurement of the strength of the ridge of high pressure broke a record Monday , according to the NWS. It was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. More than 160 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rose to about 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain. Map shows areas under a heat alert Tuesday, June 24. Here's what to know about the heat wave and how to stay safe. Heat wave forecast maps ""Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming in HOT,"" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings ""with oppressive humidity."" The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity. Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. The heat index in Philadelphia topped out at 108 on Monday. Meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome — an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity — sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality. The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say. ""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said. These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures. High temperature forecast for Tuesday, June 24. High temperature forecast for Wednesday, June 25. How long will the heat wave last? The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday. Parts of the Northeast face a ""High Risk"" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. ""The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon."" What constitutes a heat wave? A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly. Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down. ""Your body needs a reprieve,"" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. ""You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit."" When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, ""You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality."" Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S. How to stay safe during a heat wave Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended . You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty. It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say .

Earlier in the morning, Mr. Trump voiced frustration with both countries and accused them of violating the agreement he had announced just hours earlier. Israel accused Iran of breaching the agreement minutes after it was intended to take effect, and said it would ""respond forcefully."" But after a last-minute intervention by Mr. Trump — including a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — the bombardments appeared to cease. President Trump speaks with reporters before his departure from the White House to attend a NATO summit in the Netherlands, June 24, 2025. How the ceasefire deal announced by Trump took shape Mr. Trump said Monday night that Israel and Iran had agreed to a ""Complete and Total CEASEFIRE,"" a move he said would end the 12-day conflict between the two countries. Tuesday morning, Israel accused Iran of launching several missiles at Israeli territory. At least one made impact in the southern city of Beersheba, killing four people. It was unclear at the time whether the missiles were fired before or after the ceasefire was due to take effect, but Israel's defense chief accused Iran of breaching the agreement, and ordered a response. Israel later said it had launched a final round of strikes on Iran, before the ceasefire began. ""In light of Iran's complete violation of the ceasefire declared by the U.S. President and the launch of missiles towards Israel, and in accordance with the Israeli government's policy as determined to respond forcefully to any violation — I have instructed the IDF, in coordination with the Prime Minister, to continue the intense activity of attacking Tehran to thwart regime targets and terrorist infrastructures,"" Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. First Responders look at destruction caused by an Iranian missile strike in Beersheba, southern Israel, June 24, 2025. Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty President Trump was quick to respond to defend his deal, saying in a message posted on his Truth Social network: ""ISRAEL. DO NOT DROP THOSE BOMBS. IF YOU DO IT IS A MAJOR VIOLATION. BRING YOUR PILOTS HOME, NOW!"" As he prepared to depart for a NATO summit on Tuesday, he was asked if he believed Iran or Israel had violated the ceasefire. ""I think they both violated it. I don't think, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back,"" Mr. Trump said. But he appeared to direct particular criticism at Israel. ""I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to a number of strikes on Iran that Israel said it carried out just before the ceasefire was due to begin. ""Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that he would ""see if I can stop it."" ""I'm not happy with them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I'm not happy with Iran either. We basically have two countries that have been fighting for so long and so hard that they don't know what the f*** they're doing, you understand that?"" Soon after, Israel said Mr. Trump had spoken by phone with Netanyahu. In a statement after their call, Netanyahu's office said Israel had ""refrained from further attacks"" after carrying out a limited strike on a radar site outside Tehran, in retaliation for Iran's latest missile launches. Israel's timeline of airstrikes and missile exchange with Iran In a statement, the office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offered a timeline of the events on Tuesday morning, saying the ceasefire had been due to take effect at 7 a.m. local time [midnight eastern], and Israel had launched attacks on ""the heart of Tehran"" at 3 a.m. local, ""hitting regime targets and killing hundreds of Basij and Iranian security forces."" ""Shortly before the ceasefire went into effect, Iran launched a barrage of missiles, one of which claimed the lives of four of our citizens in Beersheba,"" the statement said, adding that after 7 a.m., when the ceasefire began, Iran fired additional missiles. ""At 7:06 AM, Iran launched one missile into Israeli territory and at 10:25 AM, two more missiles. The missiles were intercepted or fell in open areas without casualties or damage,"" Netanyahu's office said. ""In response to Iran's violations, the Air Force destroyed a radar array near Tehran. Following President Trump's conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel refrained from further attacks.""

Nasser Ishtayeh/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty At least 1,000 people killed in 12 days of Israel-Iran strikes The conflict between Israel and Iran began June 13, when Israel launched its first strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets. The strikes — which killed several top Iranian military officials — prompted Iranian counterattacks on Israel. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed, including at least 387 civilians and 268 Iranian military personnel, in Israel's strikes on Iran, the Washington-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran said in a statement . The group relies on a network of contacts inside Iran for its information. Iranian authorities have not provided casualty figures since not long after the Israeli strikes began. Iran's missile attacks have killed at least 28 people in Israel since June 13, according to Israeli officials. The U.S. took military action against Iran over the weekend, striking three sites that are believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was fairly limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Iran called its response ""devastating and powerful,"" but Mr. Trump called it ""very weak."" The president said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Drones hit bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops Iraqi army spokesperson Sabah Al-Naaman, in a statement quoted by the AP, said Tuesday that drones had hit military bases in the country, including some where American forces are stationed. Al-Naaman said a ""treacherous and cowardly act of aggression"" had damaged radar installations at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, and at the Imam Ali Base in Dhi Qar province in southern Iraq, not far from the Iranian border. The AP cited Al-Naaman as saying Iraqi forces intercepted drones fired at other locations. The AP cited a senior U.S. military official, whom it said was not authorized to comment publicly, as saying American forces had intercepted drones targeting the Ain al-Assad base in the western Iraq desert, and a base near Baghdad airport.

A new study says policies curb litter – by a lot,18,609,15,7,"Plastic bag regulations have led to significant decrease in shoreline litter, study finds 03:37 State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines — potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found. More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes – and if they did, to what extent. Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations. ""When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,"" Oremus said in a statement. ""And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy."" These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments . Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. A plastic bag on the banks of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 2019. Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own. Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed ""single use"" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered ""reusable"" under partial bans, ""there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use."" In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide ""preemption"" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all. During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said. ""Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting—but not eliminating—shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,"" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.

In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law. Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI, introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material. Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was ""quintessentially transformative"" and did not violate ""fair use"" doctrine under copyright law. ""Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,"" his decision states. By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue. Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles. Authors had filed suit Anthropic cheered the ruling. The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to ""large-scale theft."" The authors also alleged that Anthropic ""seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works."" The authors' attorneys declined comment. Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots. At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.

Dick's said Thursday that it expects to run Foot Locker as a standalone unit and keep the Foot Locker brands, which include Kids Foot Locker, Champs Sports, WSS and Japanese sneaker brand atmos. ""Sports and sports culture continue to be incredibly powerful, and with this acquisition, we'll create a new global platform that serves those ever evolving needs through iconic concepts consumers know and love, enhanced store designs and omnichannel experiences, as well as a product mix that appeals to our different customer bases,"" Dick's CEO Lauren Hobart said in a statement. Skechers announced that it was being taken private earlier this month by the investment firm by 3G Capital in a transaction worth more than $9 billion. Foot Locker shareholders can choose to receive either $24 in cash or 0.1168 shares of Dick's common stock for each Foot Locker share that they own. The footwear industry has been growing increasingly concerned over Mr. Trump's trade war with other countries, particularly China. Athletic shoe makers have invested heavily in production in Asia. Fool Locker's stock slide Shares of sporting goods and athletic shoe companies have been under pressure all year. Before the Dick's deal, Foot Locker's stock price has tumbled more than 40% this year. Foot Locker shares surged $10.90, or nearly 85%, to $23.78 after the start of trade on Thursday. About 97% of the clothes and shoes purchased in the U.S. are imported, predominantly from Asia, according to the American Apparel & Footwear Association. Using factories overseas has kept labor costs down for U.S. companies, but neither they nor their overseas suppliers are likely to absorb price increases due to new tariffs. Foot Locker offers Dick's a lot of potential, namely its huge real estate footprint, and would give the Pittsburgh company its first foothold overseas. ""The addition of Foot Locker, with its 4.3% share of the sporting goods market, would produce an immediate boost,"" retail industry analysts Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, said in an email. ""It would also give Dick's substantially more bargaining power with national brands, especially in the sneaker space. As the chains operate in a similar segment there would also likely be scope for synergistic savings."" Foot Locker has about 2,400 retail stores across 20 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand. It also has a licensed store presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The company had global sales of $8 billion last year. ""While there is some overlap between the locations, the nature of the stores is different, and Foot Locker would give Dick's access to a wider selection of malls and customers,"" Saunders said. Dick's said that it expects to close the Foot Locker deal in the second half of the year. The transaction still needs approval from Foot Locker shareholders.

In the report , out Friday, researchers found the estimated average number of hypertension deaths from excessive alcohol use was 51.6% higher in 2020 through 2021 than in 2016 through 2017. This increase amounted to about 21,137 deaths annually, compared to 13,941 for the respective time frames. The World Health Organization declared the COVID outbreak a pandemic in March 2020. In May 2023, it declared an end to the global pandemic emergency. The report also analyzed differences among sexes, finding that more than 60% of hypertension deaths caused by excessive drinking were among females — 61.2% during 2016 and 2017, and 62.8% during 2020 and 2021. During the 2020 through 2021 timeframe, the most recent years for which data is available, excessive alcohol use accounted for 1 in 5 hypertension deaths among females and 1 in 8 among males. The report looked at adults aged 20 and older using the CDC's Alcohol-Related Disease Impact, or ARDI, tool and mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System. The report comes as U.S. alcohol-related deaths have been increasing nationwide . Excessive alcohol use is a leading preventable cause of death in the United States, according to the CDC, with about 178,000 people dying from excessive drinking each year. Hypertension deaths linked to drinking, as analyzed in this report, are just a fraction of overall deaths caused by alcohol. Previous research has shown the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increases in stress-related drinking and alcohol-related deaths , which didn't stop as things returned to normal. One 2024 study found drinking increases from 2018 to 2020 persisted into 2022, for example. This report is among the last to be published from the CDC's Division of Population Health team that studied alcohol mortality before they were laid off amid sweeping cuts by the Trump administration.

Strapped into a new, as-yet-unnamed SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, the crew is expected to blast off from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 2:31 a.m. EDT Wednesday, roughly the moment Earth's rotation carries the rocket into the plane of the space station's orbit — a requirement for rendezvous missions. Whitson's crewmates are test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland, and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu. All three are making their first space flight. The Ax-4 crew (left to right): Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, mission commander Peggy Whitson, and European Space Agency astronaut Sławosz Uznański-Wiśniewski of Poland. SpaceX The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA flights to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit. The Falcon 9 first stage booster, B1094, will be making its second flight. After propelling the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage will attempt a return-to-launch-site landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. To date, SpaceX has pulled off 466 successful first stage landings, 63 of them in Florida. Pictures of the Axiom Ax-r mission astronauts are seen as SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft sit on the launch pad at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on June 24, 2025, in Cape Canaveral, Florida. Launch originally was planned for June 11, but the flight was held up by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It then was delayed by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module. The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port. NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it. But sources said the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the PrK compartment more that usual, ensuring the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station results in a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the leaky PrK. That minimizes, if not eliminates, any chance the air supply in the station's other modules could be affected if the leak suddenly worsened. Plans for the Ax-4 mission Assuming an on-time liftoff, Whitson, Shukla, Uznański and Kapu will dock at the space-facing port of the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday. They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.

As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker — seventh in the world overall — with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station. ""I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,"" she added. Uznański-Wiśniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying ""we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for."" The Ax-4 mission follows in the footsteps of Axiom's first three ""private astronaut missions,"" or PAMs, a formal designation by NASA for commercial research flights to the International Space Station. Throughout the two-week mission, Whitson and her crewmates will carry out a full slate of science research and technology demonstrations, along with interactive educational events in the crew's home countries. They were trained for space station operations and will have full use of the U.S. segment of the orbital lab. ""We've got a lot of objectives for our mission,"" Whitson said. ""The first, obviously, is realizing the return of these three countries to space, but this will be their first time to go to the International Space Station. ""Obviously, they will have a number of different scientific, technological and educational goals as part of their missions from each of the countries, from India, Poland and Hungary. I will be conducting some research for Axiom space as well."" All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations.

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one."" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",2025-06-24T17:16:47.200324

Why some parents are opting for the training wheel-free option for kids,17,530,16,9,"Students and parents swap the bus for biking to school together 02:10 Getting training wheels taken off a bicycle is often regarded as a rite of passage for youngsters learning to ride a bike — but some kids are skipping the step altogether by using balance bikes. Balance bikes, some of which are designed for children as young as 10 months old, don't have training wheels or pedals. Instead, they reverse the whole bike learning process, said James Beechinor, president of bike brand Early Rider 's U.S. division. While bikes with training wheels teach kids to pedal, steer and brake, balance bikes focus on the balance aspect from the start. After the child better understands how to balance, they can start cruising, getting enough momentum to lift their feet up and coast. Research has backed up the earlier riding claims, too. A 2022 study — from researchers in The Netherlands and published in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology — found practicing on a balance bike is associated with an earlier age of independent cycling compared with practicing on a bike with training wheels. ""The advantage of the balance bicycle arises because they challenge children more to actively maintain balance,"" the authors wrote. Despite being introduced several decades ago, balance bikes make up only about 1% of the kids bike market in 2024, according to Beechinor — although they recently gained more traction. Now multiple brands, styles, age ranges and prices (starting around $50 and up) have hit shelves and online retailers. Despite a decline in the overall kids bike market, balance bike sales are up, Beechinor said. ""We're definitely seeing an increase. The kids bike market as a whole is down the last 12 months by about 6% but balance bike sales are up 3% so they're kind of bucking the trend with the kids market,"" he said. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mallory Mack (@mallorymack_) The benefits of the bikes go beyond learning how to ride earlier, he argues. They boost general well-being and overall development, he says. According to a 2022 study out of Portugal that was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, balance biking can have mental and physical benefits for young kids. ""Children who begun to cycle at an early age are more likely to have a healthy weight in the subsequent school years, they can have fun moments cycling outdoors with peers or family, they develop motor components, and mature their social and emotional skills,"" the authors wrote.

More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes – and if they did, to what extent. Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations.

Since then, more than 7,200 new zero-emissions vehicles have been distributed to the Postal Service. But a provision tucked inside the Senate Republican bill to enact President Trump's second-term agenda would force the USPS to sell off the brand new trucks and cancel or significantly amend the contract for the remaining 58,800 that are due to be delivered over the next 10 years. FILE - The U.S. Postal Service's next-generation delivery vehicle, left, is displayed as one new battery electric delivery trucks leaves the Kokomo Sorting and Delivery Center in Kokomo, Ind., Thursday, Aug. 29, 2024. Michael Conroy / AP According to the text of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs portion of the bill released by Kentucky GOP Senator Rand Paul, chair of the committee, all electric vehicles and related infrastructure owned by the Postal Service will be sold and the proceeds will ""be deposited into the general fund of the treasury."" Selling the EVs would ""cut unnecessary costs and focus USPS on delivering mail and not achieving the environmental initiatives pushed by the Biden Administration,"" according to the bill. Paul's office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Peter Pastre, the vice president of government relations and public policy for USPS, wrote a letter to the Senate in June that said the provision to sell the EVs would ""make major and damaging changes to the U.S. Postal Service's vehicle fleet program, potentially impacting our ability to deliver to millions of Americans."" The bill is being considered under budget reconciliation rules, which means that Republicans can pass it with a simple majority, instead of meeting the 60-vote threshold that is required to consider most Senate legislation. In order to use this approach, every item in the bill must have a budgetary impact, and the Senate parliamentarian determines whether each provision meets that standard, known as the Byrd Rule. Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough found that disposing of the USPS EVs is one of several of the bill's provisions violating the Byrd Rule, according to Senate Democrats . Republicans, who would like to revoke the EVs and their related infrastructure, say this provision could potentially raise money by rescinding $1 billion allocated in the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act to purchase the vehicles. But according to Pastre, it would cost more than $450 million to replace the 7,200 revoked vehicles, and the USPS has already spent more than $540 million on electrical upgrades for infrastructure to support the cars. Because the majority of the vehicles are specially designed for the Postal Service — like right-side driving for mail delivery trucks — and most of the electrical infrastructure is buried under ground, the potential for raising money at auction is ""negligible,"" according to Pastre. Pastre was direct about the harm this action would cause the Postal Service saying, ""it will seriously cripple our ability to replace an aging and obsolete delivery fleet."" Since 2015, the USPS has been looking to update and modernize its fleet of more than 200,000 vehicles. The majority of the trucks were 25 years old or more, often lacked proper heating and cooling and in some cases, would spontaneously combust in neighborhoods as workers operated the aging vehicles. When the Postal Service first announced its proposal in 2021 to replace 165,000 vehicles, it originally intended to purchase traditional gas vehicles to replace 90% of the fleet. But the gas-powered mail trucks had low fuel efficiency, guzzling fuel at under a 9-m.p.g. rate, according to filings by several environmental organizations and more than a dozen states that sued to block the plan. ""It's important that EVs be part of the mix for the USPS because it should represent the next generation,"" said Dan Becker, director of the Safe Climate Transport Campaign at the Center for Biological Diversity, one of the organizations that sued the USPS in 2021. ""The last generation of vehicles are literally dying on its wheels."" The legal action forced the USPS to reconsider its plan, and it finalized a deal in late 2022 to purchase 106,000 new cars — and 66,000 were to be zero-emissions vehicles. It also planned to install more than 14,000 chargers to keep the fleet running. The cost to update the fleet totaled $9.6 billion, and the Biden administration allocated $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act to help cover the costs, with the rest financed by the Postal Service. ""My bet is this will survive another day,"" said Becker, given that the parliamentarian has ruled it should be stricken and it would be difficult to get 60 votes in the Senate to keep it in the bill. But Congress recently voted to revoke California's EPA waivers to enact its EV mandate under the Congressional Review Act, which the parliamentarian said was illegal. It remains to be seen if Republicans will follow her recommendations. ""Selling them off at a discount just so you don't have to say you don't have EVs for political reasons makes no sense,"" said Becker.

""An accident like this only happens when there are multiple system failures,"" NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy said at a meeting on Tuesday, partly blaming Boeing's safety processes for the incident. Homendy led the investigation into what happened before the door panel blew out six minutes into Alaska Flight 1282 that took off from Portland on Jan. 5, 2024. The aircraft was at about 16,000 feet over Oregon during a trip to California when it had to make an emergency landing. Four bolts meant to hold the Boeing 737 Max 9 door plug in place were missing , the NTSB discovered after the fact. ""The safety deficiencies that led to this accident should have been evident … to Boeing and to the FAA … and were therefore preventable,"" Homendy said at the meeting Tuesday. The accident left a gaping hole in the plane that had 177 people on board; eight of them suffered minor injuries . In the NTSB's report, investigators said the incident's probable cause was in the in-flight separation of the left mid exit door plug, blaming "" Boeing 's failure to provide adequate training, guidance, and oversight necessary to ensure that manufacturing personnel could consistently and correctly comply with its parts removal process, which was intended to document and ensure that 4 the securing bolts and hardware that were removed to facilitate rework during the manufacturing process were properly reinstalled."" Investigators also faulted the FAA for the agency's oversight. ""Contributing to the accident was the FAA's ineffective compliance enforcement surveillance and audit planning activities, which failed to adequately identify and ensure that Boeing addressed the repetitive and systemic nonconformance issues associated with its parts removal process,"" the report said. In a statement, the FAA said it is taking the NTSB's safety recommendations seriously and will carefully evaluate the ones issued Tuesday. ""The FAA has fundamentally changed how it oversees Boeing since the Alaska Airlines door-plug accident and we will continue this aggressive oversight to ensure Boeing fixes its systemic production-quality issues,"" the FAA's statement said. ""We are actively monitoring Boeing's performance and meet weekly with the company to review its progress and any challenges it's facing in implementing necessary changes."" The FAA also said its safety inspectors are in Boeing's facilities conducting more targeted audits and inspections. However, the agency said it has not lifted the 737 monthly production cap it has placed on Boeing until the FAA can confidently say Boeing can maintain the safety and quality of its aircraft. ""We at Boeing regret this accident and continue to work on strengthening safety and quality across our operations. We will review the final report and recommendations as we continue to implement improvements,"" a spokesperson for Boeing said Tuesday following the NTSB meeting. When the 737 Max involved in the accident was being manufactured, Boeing removed the door panel to make repairs to rivets nearby, according to the NTSB's report. Paperwork that would have triggered additional inspections was never created and the panel was reinstalled without its bolts — and the team that did the work had never opened that type of door panel. ""It is due to a process issue, a process failure. A lot of people have focused on one or two Boeing personnel or door plug personnel. I think we have to really step back and look at the entire process was reliant on humans to set to put in a record that the door needed to be removed and put back in place,"" she said. Shandy Brewer was sitting in Row 10 on the flight when the door blew off. It was an experience that stuck with her 18 months later. ""All of a sudden, just this huge bang happened. It sounded like a firework going off, like right in your ears, just like so loud,"" she recalled. ""As soon as I step onto an airplane, tears start pouring down my face every single time. I haven't been on a flight where that doesn't happen."" Brewer is among a group of 35 passengers who have filed a lawsuit against Boeing and Alaska Airlines in King County, Washington, where Boeing is headquartered. The companies have previously declined to comment on other lawsuits over the incident . Despite the failure, Homendy said she feels like Boeing airplanes are safe, adding that she has ""no concerns"" about that. However, she said there are ways to improve safety. ""We found that in our investigation and we hope to help them close any gaps that remain,"" Homendy said. The NTSB's new safety recommendations to the FAA include: Revising its compliance enforcement surveillance system, audit planning activities, and records systems Developing guidance and provide recurrent training to managers and inspectors Retaining historical compliance enforcement and audit records older than 5 years Convening an independent third-party panel to conduct a comprehensive review of Boeing's safety culture In a statement, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the prior administration and Boeing for taking ""their eye off the ball."" ""They were distracted and safety was put at risk. That can never happen again,"" Duffy said. ""Under this new administration, safety is paramount and it drives everything we do. Whether it's building an all-new air traffic control system or ensuring Boeing and other manufacturers are delivering safe products, we will not hesitate to implement changes."" In response to the NTSB meeting Tuesday, Alaska Airlines said: ""We look forward to reviewing the final report in the weeks ahead. We remain deeply grateful for the heroic actions of the crew of Flight 1282 and will continue ensuring safety is always Alaska Airlines' highest priority.""

Eight children have come down with severe food poisoning since June 12 after consuming meat products from the two businesses in the northern city of Saint-Quentin. Five of them contracted a rare foodborne illness called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), including a 12-year-old girl who died. HUS in most cases occurs after someone ingests E.coli , commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. HUS can lead to kidney failure, permanent health problems and even death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . It is ""impossible at this stage to confirm that the consumption of products from these two establishments is the source of the contamination,"" local authorities said. But the children all consumed meat or meat products from these two butchers a few days before symptoms appeared, it said. Authorities have closed the two shops as a precautionary measure while samples from both stores are tested. The authorities said they should have the results ""early next week"" and an investigation has been launched into where the meat came from. HUS affects between 100 and 165 children in France each year, according to the country's public health agency. E. coli outbreaks have also made headlines recently in the U.S. Earlier this month, the Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced that ground beef that was distributed nationwide may be contaminated with E. coli. In November, a carrot recall was issued by California grower Grimmway Farms after nearly 40 cases were recorded in 18 states. At least 15 people were hospitalized and one person died, the CDC said . The month before that, an outbreak linked to McDonald's Quarter Pounders killed one person in Colorado and affected at least 104 people across 14 states , according to the CDC.

The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that ""at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed."" The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases. ""Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,"" the department said in a statement. A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims ""not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.""

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

A poll by Bankrate found that nearly half of respondents think they need to early at least $100,00 a year to live comfortably, while a quarter said they need to make at least $150,000. To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm. Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate. ""Times have shifted,"" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. ""Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury."" As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures . If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4% , up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate. According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more. By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure. Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey. Finance Inflation United States Census Bureau",2025-06-24T17:17:00.685485
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-summit-iran-ukraine/,Politics,2025-06-24T14:00:28-0400,Trump attends NATO summit as Iran overshadows agenda,8,937,18,5,"Trump to meet with Zelenskyy at NATO summit as Russia-Ukraine war rages on 05:45 President Trump on Tuesday heads to a whirlwind NATO summit at the Hague, Netherlands, hours after he announced that Iran and Israel had reached a ceasefire agreement . Several hours after the ceasefire was to take effect, Mr. Trump told reporters as he left for the summit that both Israel and Iran had violated it. Then, after speaking with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the president said Israel would not bomb Iran again, and that ""the ceasefire is in effect."" The president hoped to secure during the summit a commitment from NATO allies to spend at least 5% of GDP on defense. But a day before he was to arrive, the alliance had already agreed to the boost in defense spending, according to Matthew Whitaker, U.S. ambassador to NATO. He told reporters in a briefing Monday that as a result of Mr. Trump's leadership, NATO was ""on track"" to make that ""historic commitment"" of 5%. During the flight to the Netherlands, Mr. Trump posted an effusive note from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte congratulating him on his actions in Iran and on the new NATO defense spending levels. ""[T]hank you for your decisive action in Iran,"" Rutte wrote. He called it ""truly extraordinary"" and said it was ""something no one else dared to do. It makes us all safer."" And of the new spending, Rutte said, ""It was not easy, but we've got them all signed onto 5 percent!"" He called it an ""important moment for America and Europe,"" and told him, ""You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done."" A NATO spokesperson confirmed that Rutte had written the text to Mr. Trump. The U.S. spent roughly 3.4% of GDP on defense in 2023, but the president has said he thinks the U.S. should not have the same 5% target. ""We've been supporting NATO so long, in many cases, I believe, paying almost 100% of the cost,"" he told reporters Friday. ""So, I don't think we should, but I think that the NATO countries should, absolutely."" There is no clear timeline for the 5% commitment, however, and reaching that threshold could extend into the 2030s for some NATO countries, fueling criticism that the 5% promise could be an empty one. Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is at the Hague with a bipartisan group of senators, expressed optimism about the allies' efforts to raise their defense spending. Aside from the conflict in the Middle East, Russia's war on Ukraine continues to be a top topic of concern for NATO members. It is not yet clear whether the U.S. will support language citing Russia as the main threat to NATO in its communique — Whitaker avoided directly answering a reporter's question about this. ""Negotiations regarding the communique are still underway, so I'm not going to be able to comment directly on the specific language,"" Whitaker said, adding, ""I fully expect that the summit statement will be direct, to the point, and reflect the Allies' current threat assessment and the need for collective defense and the individual defense of all Allies."" He said that the U.S. is ""calling for restraint and [urging] both parties to avoid escalation,"" and he went on to say that the U.S. is ""engaged at the highest levels"" and backs direct talks between Russia and Ukraine. Shaheen said she'd like to see the U.S. ""put a lot more pressure on Russia and Vladimir Putin,"" and she added, ""I think we need to pass the tough sanctions bill that we have in the Senate that has 82 sponsors."" Shortly before the summit, on Saturday, the U.S. carried out strikes targeting three Iranian sites believed to be key to Iran's nuclear program . The move sparked fears of a wider war, but Iran's response on Monday was limited. Iran fired more than a dozen missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar , most of which were intercepted, and no injuries were reported, U.S. and Qatari officials said. Mr. Trump called the retaliatory strikes ""very weak,"" and he said in another social media post that he wanted ""to thank Iran for giving us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost."" Iran Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei also pointed out in a social media post after the Iranian strikes, ""We didn't harm anyone."" Within hours, Mr. Trump made the announcement that Iran and Israel would implement a ceasefire and shortly bring the war to an end. The NATO summit will feature a single two-and-a-half-hour session, instead of multiple sessions. Mr. Trump also plans to meet separately with several world leaders on the sidelines, a senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call Friday. The president left for the summit early Tuesday morning and returns Wednesday. NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is the largest defense alliance in the world, with 32 members, including the U.S. It was formed in the aftermath of World War II, and has grown since, with its latest additions being Finland in 2023 and Sweden in 2024.

One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be. Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however — and netting out to a majority overall — there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war. Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon . Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran. Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern. Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel. Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall. A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran. Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall. Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.) The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war. Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel. Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon. Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession . That sentiment has not abated in recent months. Toplines cbsnews_20250624_iran_1 by CBSNews.com on Scribd United States Congress Iran Opinion Poll Nuclear Weapons",2025-06-24T17:17:03.940591
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/heat-wave-forecast-us-maps-this-week/,World,2025-06-24T07:37:00-0400,"Maps show heat wave forecast across much of U.S., with more record highs expected today. Here's how long it will last.",21,927,20,10,"How to handle the dangerous heat wave scorching the Northeast 02:00 The worst heat is likely to peak for cities in the Northeast on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. ""A large portion of the region will see high temperatures ranging between 98 and 101 degrees,"" the agency said , with ""numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures"" expected through at least Wednesday. ""Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,"" the weather service warned. A key measurement of the strength of the ridge of high pressure broke a record Monday , according to the NWS. It was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. More than 160 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rose to about 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain. Map shows areas under a heat alert Tuesday, June 24. Here's what to know about the heat wave and how to stay safe. Heat wave forecast maps ""Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming in HOT,"" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings ""with oppressive humidity."" The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity. Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. The heat index in Philadelphia topped out at 108 on Monday. Meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome — an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity — sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality. The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say. ""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said. These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures. High temperature forecast for Tuesday, June 24. High temperature forecast for Wednesday, June 25. How long will the heat wave last? The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday. Parts of the Northeast face a ""High Risk"" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. ""The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon."" What constitutes a heat wave? A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly. Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down. ""Your body needs a reprieve,"" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. ""You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit."" When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, ""You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality."" Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S. How to stay safe during a heat wave Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended . You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty. It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say .

Here's what to know.,14,293,17,4,"First-ever Starbucks Global Barista champion crowned 00:49 Starbucks said Tuesday that the coffee chain is changing how it charges for beverage add-ins like matcha and syrups as it moves to standardize pricing across the company's stores. Starbucks will now charge 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce that modifies an unflavored drink, instead of charging for each addition. But the company noted that it won't charge customers to substitute a sauce or syrup in a pre-flavored drink, such as adding vanilla syrup to a Caffè Mocha. Starbucks also plans to charge $1 for adding a scoop of matcha powder to non-matcha drinks, and will charge 50 cents to include dried fruit in a beverage. The changes were reported earlier by Bloomberg News. The change is the latest under CEO Brian Niccol, who wants to overhaul the coffee giant's image as it looks to drive growth. As part of that effort, Niccol wants to improve customer service and ensure that Starbucks cafes are "" inviting places to linger ,"" among other goals and initiatives. The company on Tuesday also said it's conducting a limited customer test of a new feature in the Starbucks app to show pricing updates in real time when a consumer is ordering food or drinks. The goal is to provide better pricing transparency when people place an order, a Starbucks spokesperson said. Starbucks said customers can add its classic syrup, a liquid sugar akin to simple syrup, to any drink at no cost. Starbucks",2025-06-24T17:17:07.318722

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption. This image from video shows a SpaceX Starship upper stage exploding at the Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, June 18, 2025. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV. But the company said there is ""no commonality"" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship. ""Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,"" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. ""If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design."" The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week. Such ""hotfire"" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th ""integrated flight test."" But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing. The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast. Flames rise as a SpaceX rocket explodes ahead of an engine test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, June 18, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted. ""On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" SpaceX said in a statement on X. ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. ""There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area."" What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known. NASA counting on Starship for moon mission SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages. The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. It will not be easy. To get the Human Landing System — HLS — Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a ""depot"" Starship, undock, and return to Earth. The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule. SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon. NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement. While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that ""NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions."" ""We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission."" Elon Musk SpaceX",2025-06-24T17:17:10.587504

A new study says policies curb litter – by a lot,18,609,15,7,"Plastic bag regulations have led to significant decrease in shoreline litter, study finds 03:37 State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines — potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found. More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes – and if they did, to what extent. Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations. ""When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,"" Oremus said in a statement. ""And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy."" These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments . Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. A plastic bag on the banks of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 2019. Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own. Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed ""single use"" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered ""reusable"" under partial bans, ""there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use."" In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide ""preemption"" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all. During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said. ""Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting—but not eliminating—shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,"" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.

The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be ""helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks."" The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program. In response to the strikes, Iran launched a ballistic missile attack targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties. The attack came after Israel launched strikes against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday, at least 974 people have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran. Israeli officials have said at least 28 people in Israel have died in Iran's missile attacks. A ceasefire announced by President Trump between Israel and Iran appears to be holding on Tuesday, with the two sides halting their exchange of fire after 12 days.

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions. The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson. Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend. But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety. While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings. In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse. In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head."" According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America. This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire . On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities."" Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back."" She added, ""We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so."" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Iran",2025-06-24T17:17:17.063195

The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be ""helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports."" An FBI spokesperson said the bureau ""does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people."" President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has invoked a wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants, rolled back programs shielding people from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about accepting migrants who are not their citizens . Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and led the president to call roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as Title 10 . His administration has also deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines to Los Angeles. Heightened terrorism concerns The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a bulletin Sunday warning that the Iran conflict has created a ""heightened threat environment"" in the U.S. ""Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,"" the advisory warned. ""Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks.""

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.

A poll by Bankrate found that nearly half of respondents think they need to early at least $100,00 a year to live comfortably, while a quarter said they need to make at least $150,000. To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm. Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate. ""Times have shifted,"" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. ""Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury."" As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures . If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4% , up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate. According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more. By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure. Women and men also differed in their views on financial security.

Investing experts weigh in",10,838,21,5,"Gold could hit the $4,000-per-ounce price threshold soon, but there are multiple factors at play, experts say. Gold has delivered a stunning performance since the beginning of 2024, surging from around $2,000 per ounce to where it sits today at over $3,400 per ounce. The precious metal shattered multiple price records along the way, including breaking through the key $3,000 barrier for the first time in history. This remarkable run was propelled by a number of factors, from inflation concerns to geopolitical uncertainties and heavy central bank buying. And, with the gold price per ounce now hovering near yet another potential record, it's natural to wonder: Will the precious metal reach $4,000 soon? We spoke with three investing experts to understand what could drive gold to this milestone and when it might realistically happen. Their insights reveal what's ahead for gold investing and practical ways to get exposure without paying today's high prices. Find out how to add gold to your investment portfolio today .

Investing experts weigh in ""If gold prices follow the same percentage gains as last year, then hitting $4,000 in 2025 is in sight,"" says Ben Nadelstein, head of content at gold yield marketplace Monetary Metals. Nadelstein believes that in the long term, the dollar will continue to lose value relative to gold. Brandon Aversano, CEO of fintech platform The Alloy Market, expects gold to hit $4,000 within one year. ""Given the instability and [global] conflict coupled with strong central bank demand and inflation, it's unlikely we'll see gold prices do anything but continue to increase,"" Aversano says. Gold has long been a tool used to hedge against inflation, which drives central bank buying during economic distress . The key indicator to watch, according to Aversano, is whether gold posts double-digit monthly or quarterly gains. This would signal an acceleration toward the $4,000-per-ounce mark. ""[But if] we see the pace of gold price slow considerably, it may take longer to reach the milestone,"" he cautions. Portfolio manager Thomas Winmill at Midas Funds, an investment management firm specializing in mutual funds focused on precious metals, takes a more measured approach to the timeline. While gold has already climbed significantly in the first half of 2025, Winmill's analysis of supply and demand trends suggests a longer outlook. Unless there's a serious geopolitical event, ""reaching $4,000 is more likely to occur in the next one to two years,"" Winmill says. Explore your gold investing options online now . Ads by Money.

Ad Strategies for investing in the gold market now Today's gold prices may feel steep, but experts say there are still smart ways to gain exposure without paying premium prices. Here are a few strategies they recommend for getting started: Maintain a long-term outlook. Aversano recommends treating gold as a long-term asset class . ""[The precious metal] is best used as a way to diversify a well-balanced financial portfolio,"" Aversano says. This approach means avoiding the temptation to jump in and out of gold investments based on daily price movements. The long-term strategy works especially well if you believe gold will reach $4,000 but aren't concerned about the exact timing. By focusing on the big picture instead of daily swings, you can benefit from gold's rise without worrying about perfect timing. Look into leasing out your gold. According to Nadelstein, leasing gold allows you to earn a monthly yield that's paid in gold, regardless of short-term price movements . With this strategy, you essentially lend your gold to borrowers and earn interest on it. Gold holders can start by deploying stored gold into a lease program. Instead of paying storage fees , you earn more gold ounces over time. This means you're adding to your position without having to buy more at today's high prices. This approach may be appealing if you already own some gold and believe the price will eventually reach $4,000. Consider gold mining mutual funds. ""[Allocate] a percentage of [your] assets to mutual funds investing in the stocks of gold mining companies that can benefit from currently high gold prices,"" Winmill suggests. He expects mining company revenues and profits to surge over the next quarter due to these elevated gold prices. Winmill says that the best gold mining mutual funds typically focus on consistently profitable mining companies with solid balance sheets. When evaluating gold mining mutual funds, look for those that target companies with strong management teams and track records of generating free cash flow during uncertain times. The bottom line Whether gold will reach $4,000 in 2025 or later, experts agree on one thing: Get exposure sooner rather than later. ""[Start] with some investment amount and try to add to [it] regularly,"" Winmill says. That way, you can realize consistent returns over time. Dollar-cost averaging can also help you weather short-term price volatility while staying positioned for long-term appreciation. If you're considering your options, a trusted financial advisor can help you determine the best approach for your portfolio .",2025-06-24T17:17:25.213541

And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world. More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies. One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula — both several thousand light-years from Earth — glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops. The Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible. Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies. Spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster are pictured among a larger cluster of galaxies. NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory The team also released a video dubbed the ""cosmic treasure chest,"" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more. ""The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,"" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system. Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision. ""So, we really need very sharp images,"" Urbach said. The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, ""really far away ... means they come from earlier times."" The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter — a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies. Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown. The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids. In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects — all of which pose no threat. For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year. Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system. Chile Galaxy Space",2025-06-24T17:17:26.830983

""It's kind of a moot point now, isn't it?"" the Louisiana Republican said Monday evening. ""It seems rather silly at this point and I hope they'll acknowledge it as such and put it to bed because it has zero chance of passing anyway."" Israel and Iran have not commented on Mr. Trump's ceasefire announcement. As Mr. Trump last week weighed whether to use direct military force against Iran, a bipartisan contingent of lawmakers demanded that the president seek congressional approval before moving forward with any action. Several war powers resolutions were introduced in both chambers before Saturday's strikes to prevent the U.S. from becoming involved in the war between Iran and Israel. The resolutions would require Congress to authorize force against Iran, preventing the president from taking unilateral action. Lawmakers backing the resolutions have emphasized that only Congress has the power to declare war under the Constitution. Following the U.S. attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, Reps. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, and Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, called on Congress to reconvene immediately to vote on their war powers resolution, which has dozens of cosponsors. House members across the political spectrum, from Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia to Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have come out against a conflict with Iran, indicating that the resolution could have broad support and pass. But Johnson indicated earlier Monday that it might not get a vote, telling reporters that it's not the ""appropriate time"" for a war powers resolution. ""For 80 years, presidents of both parties have acted with the same commander-in-chief authority under Article Two,"" Johnson said. ""The president made an evaluation that the danger was imminent enough to take his authority as commander in chief and make that decision."" Massie said he would not force a vote on the resolution if the ceasefire holds and the U.S. is not engaged in ""hostilities"" toward Iran. ""Then it's a moot point,"" he said, calling the situation ""wait and see."" Meanwhile, top Democrats in Congress said they were still in the dark about Mr. Trump's decision to bomb three nuclear sites in Iran Saturday, even as Iran launched retaliatory strikes Monday. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Monday afternoon that he still hasn't been briefed by the White House. Jeffries received a brief call shortly before Mr. Trump announced the strikes to the public on Saturday, according to a source familiar with the call. Jeffries told reporters the notification was a ""courtesy call with no explanation as to the rationale"" for the U.S. military involvement in Iran and accused the president of potentially misleading the public. He wants to know, ""What is the administration hiding?"" And Jeffries added that he has asked the administration to brief congressional leaders and the top Democrats and Republicans on the intelligence committees on the escalating conflict. ""It has yet to occur, and it's not clear to me what the administration is hiding from the Congress and from the American people."" A spokesperson for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he received a similar notification ""without any details"" before the strikes on Iran. In a statement Monday after Iran retaliated, Schumer said he's asked the Trump administration to give him a classified briefing on ""the full threat picture, the intelligence behind Iran's retaliation, and the details, scope and timeline of any U.S. response."" ""The Trump administration should not make the same mistake it made this weekend by launching strikes without giving any details to Congress,"" Schumer said. Jeffries also said he was not briefed earlier Monday before Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. But Johnson said he had received a classified briefing on the situation Monday morning. ""The retaliation was expected,"" Johnson told reporters. The Trump administration is expected to brief all House and Senate lawmakers on the situation on Tuesday. Jeffries said the administration has not presented Congress with any evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring immediate military action. ""What was the imminent threat to the United States of America?"" Jeffries said. ""There's been no evidence to present an imminent threat."" In the Senate, a similar resolution has been introduced by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.

At least six figures, many Americans say.",18,430,18,5,"New data on wage growth for people staying at current jobs 02:20 A huge swath of Americans feels under pressure to earn big bucks simply to keep pace with the rising cost of living, a new survey suggests. A poll by Bankrate found that nearly half of respondents think they need to early at least $100,00 a year to live comfortably, while a quarter said they need to make at least $150,000. To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm. Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate. ""Times have shifted,"" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. ""Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury."" As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures . If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4% , up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate. According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more. By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure. Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey. Finance Inflation United States Census Bureau",2025-06-24T17:17:30.085802
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-starship-upper-stage-explosion-expected-engine-test-firing/,World,2025-06-19T17:58:00-0400,SpaceX Starship upper stage explodes during countdown to engine test firing,11,1168,17,4,"Why did SpaceX's Starship explode ahead of test launch? 02:21 The dramatic explosion of a SpaceX Starship upper stage rocket during a test at the company's Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf coast late Wednesday may have been triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said Thursday. The sudden explosion, fueled by ignition of methane propellant, created a huge fireball, billowing clouds of smoke and brilliant arcs of flaming debris shooting out like burning chunks of lava in a volcanic eruption. This image from video shows a SpaceX Starship upper stage exploding at the Starbase facility on the Texas Gulf Coast late Wednesday, June 18, 2025. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The blast was reminiscent of the sudden explosion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket during fueling at Cape Canaveral in August 2016 that destroyed an Israeli communications satellite. The Falcon 9 failure was blamed on the rupture of a high-pressure helium tank, known as a composite overwrapped pressure vessel, or COPV. But the company said there is ""no commonality"" between the Falcon COPVs and those used in the Starship. ""Preliminary data suggests that a nitrogen COPV in the payload bay failed below its proof pressure,"" Musk said of the latest mishap on his social media platform X. ""If further investigation confirms that this is what happened, it is the first time ever for this design."" The Starship upper stage exploded during the final stages of a countdown expected to end with a test firing of the rocket's six methane-powered Raptor engines on a test stand at the Starbase manufacturing facility. A single-engine test firing was carried out earlier this week. Such ""hotfire"" tests are a normal precursor to actual flights, allowing engineers to verify upgrades and overall performance prior to committing the rocket to launch. A successful test Wednesday would have helped pave the way to launch atop a Super Heavy booster around the end of the month for the program's 10th ""integrated flight test."" But the test did not go well. Video from LabPadre, a company that monitors SpaceX activities at Starbase, showed the Starship suddenly exploding in a huge fireball just after 11 p.m. CDT, 10 to 15 minutes before the anticipated engine test firing. The video showed what appeared to be two major explosions, the first detonation near the nose of the rocket followed a moment later by a second eruption of flame and debris on the left side of the spacecraft. The test stand disappeared in a billowing orange fireball that rose into the overnight sky like a bomb blast. Flames rise as a SpaceX rocket explodes ahead of an engine test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, June 18, 2025, in this screengrab obtained from a social media video. TheRocketFuture via X / Reuters The Starship was being filled with a full load of liquid oxygen and a partial load of high-energy methane fuel when the detonations occurred. Ninety minutes after the initial blast, fires were still burning at the test site, where cryogenic testing and hotfires are typically conducted. ""On Wednesday, June 18 at approximately 11 p.m. CT, the Starship preparing for the tenth flight test experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase,"" SpaceX said in a statement on X. ""A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for. Our Starbase team is actively working to safe the test site and the immediate surrounding area in conjunction with local officials. ""There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area."" What impact the explosion might have had on the infrastructure at the test sight was not immediately known. NASA counting on Starship for moon mission SpaceX has launched nine Super Heavy-Starship test flights since April 2023. The first three flights ended with explosions or breakups that destroyed both stages. The fourth, fifth and sixth test flights were mostly successful, but two of the three most recent flights ended with Starship explosions before the spacecraft could reach its planned sub-orbital trajectory. During the third, most recent flight on May 27, the Starship reached its planned trajectory, but then spun out of control and broke up when it fell back into the atmosphere. NASA is counting on the giant rocket to launch a Starship variant to the moon that will carry astronauts to a landing near the lunar south pole in the next two or three years. It will not be easy. To get the Human Landing System — HLS — Starship variant to the moon, SpaceX will need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships to Earth orbit in rapid-fire fashion where they will have to autonomously dock, transfer excess propellants to a ""depot"" Starship, undock, and return to Earth. The HLS then would rendezvous and dock with the depot, reload its tanks and head for the moon to await the arrival of the Artemis astronauts aboard a Lockheed Martin-built Orion crew capsule. SpaceX has not said how many refueling flights might be necessary. But given that both the lander and tanker Starships will use up most of their propellant just getting into orbit, some independent observers estimate as many as 10 to 20 launches will be needed to gas up the lander for the flight to the moon. NASA officials have said the number likely will be in the ""high teens."" It's not known what might happen if one of those refueling flights suffers a catastrophic failure, but it's difficult to imagine launches would continue without first finding out what went wrong and fixing it. Along with mastering autonomous transfer of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid oxygen and hydrogen while in space — a task never attempted at this scale — SpaceX will need to develop a reliable system to keep those propellants cold enough in the glare of the sun to minimize the amount that will boil off and be vented out to space. No such technology has yet been tested in the space environment. The need to launch multiple Super Heavy-Starships, the requirement to perfect the autonomous transfer of cryogenic propellants in space and new technology to keep the liquid methane and oxygen from warming and wasting away add up to a complex mission architecture with little margin for error under the current schedule. The latest mishap renews concern in some quarters about SpaceX's ability to get all of that done in just two to three years. But SpaceX has proven skeptics wrong before and NASA continues to express support for the company and the path forward to the Artemis 3 lumar landing mission. ""Testing is a critical part of a development program, and we have confidence SpaceX will investigate every aspect of what went wrong to fix the issue,"" the agency said in a statement. While pointing out that the moon lander planned for its Artemis program is different from the developmental Starship currently being tested, the agency added that ""NASA fully supports SpaceX as the company prepares Starship for future missions."" ""We look forward to the company delivering their Starship Human Landing System for NASA's Artemis 3 mission."" Elon Musk SpaceX",2025-06-24T17:17:31.713830

Here's how long it will last.",21,927,20,10,"How to handle the dangerous heat wave scorching the Northeast 02:00 The worst heat is likely to peak for cities in the Northeast on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. ""A large portion of the region will see high temperatures ranging between 98 and 101 degrees,"" the agency said , with ""numerous daily record maximum and minimum temperatures"" expected through at least Wednesday. ""Light winds, sunny skies, and a lack of overnight cooling will pose a significant risk to those without adequate cooling and/or hydration,"" the weather service warned. A key measurement of the strength of the ridge of high pressure broke a record Monday , according to the NWS. It was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a ""near historic"" heat wave, private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former chief scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told The Associated Press. More than 160 million Americans are under the highest level extreme heat alerts. Including heat advisories, the total number affected rose to about 200 million. This marks one of the most expansive heat alert events ever, with major population centers from the Midwest to the Northeast under serious heat strain. Map shows areas under a heat alert Tuesday, June 24. Here's what to know about the heat wave and how to stay safe. Heat wave forecast maps ""Summer has taken its time arriving in the Northeast, but it's coming in HOT,"" the National Weather Service wrote in a social media post last week, warning of triple-digit heat index readings ""with oppressive humidity."" The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity. Heat indexes on Sunday hit 103 F in Chicago, 105 in Pittsburgh and around 104 in Columbus, Ohio. The heat index in Philadelphia topped out at 108 on Monday. Meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome — an area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere that traps heat and humidity — sitting over a large portion of the country. When a heat dome becomes stationary, the air within it can become extremely hot and stagnant, leading to dangerously high temperatures and poor air quality. The first few heat waves of the season are particularly dangerous because the human body has yet to adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, experts say. ""You're talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that's a big deal,"" NOAA meteorologist David Roth said. These maps show daily forecast highs across the country and their departures from average temperatures. High temperature forecast for Tuesday, June 24. High temperature forecast for Wednesday, June 25. How long will the heat wave last? The heat shifted into the Midwest and Ohio Valley and then arrived in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday, where it will linger through the first half of this week. The most extreme temperatures are expected to peak on Tuesday in many areas, but highs in the 90s continue through Wednesday. Parts of the Northeast face a ""High Risk"" of extreme heat through the middle of this week, according to the National Weather Service. ""I cannot emphasize this enough: extreme heat can be deadly,"" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul warned. ""The best way to stay safe is stay indoors, with air conditioning. This is not the time to start training for the marathon."" What constitutes a heat wave? A heat wave is a period of unusually hot weather that lasts more than two days, according to the National Weather Service. It often, but not always, covers a wide area and can expose a large number of people to hazardous heat, which can be extremely dangerous for vulnerable people, including children and the elderly. Warmer overnight low temperatures can make a heat wave especially dangerous, since they mean the body doesn't get as much of a chance to cool down. ""Your body needs a reprieve,"" Ashley Ward, director of the Heat Policy Innovation Hub at Duke University, told The Associated Press. ""You don't get that overnight, we start the next day at a deficit."" When overnight temperatures stay above about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, she said, ""You start to see some pretty extraordinary outcomes with respect to heat illness and heat stroke, and even mortality."" Climate change is making extreme temperatures and heat waves more frequent and longer-lasting, with the number of days above 95 degrees expected to increase across the U.S. How to stay safe during a heat wave Heat is the leading cause of weather-related deaths, and heat related illnesses increase significantly during extreme heat and high humidity events. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say. If strenuous outdoor activities are unavoidable, you should dress for the heat and wear lightweight, loose-fitting and light-colored clothing, the National Weather Service recommended . You should also stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water, even if you're not thirsty. It's also important to be aware of any symptoms of overheating, which include muscle cramps, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, dizziness, headaches, weakness or nausea, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . If you experience these symptoms, one major sign to seek care is if the symptoms don't improve after getting into a cooler environment or hydrating, experts say .

The assessment, produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon's military intelligence wing, said the strikes caused the entrances to two nuclear enrichment facilities, including Fordo , to be sealed off. Resumption of the enrichment program may be determined by how long it takes Iran to clear the entrances and make repairs to electrical and water supplies, two sources familiar with the report's findings said. The DIA assessment also indicates some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile was moved before the strikes, one of the sources said. Officials familiar with the report cautioned that it was an early assessment that could change as more information becomes available about the sites. It was not immediately clear at what confidence level the judgments included in the report were made. A complete battle damage assessment is still being assembled, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said on Sunday at a press availability. ""Final battle damage will take some time, but initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,"" Caine said. President Trump said in an address to the nation following the strikes that ""Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated."" The U.S. Air Force dropped several 30,000-pound bombs on the Fordo uranium enrichment facility early Sunday morning local time. But the DIA assessment found the site's enrichment infrastructure — which is located hundreds of feet beneath a mountain — is so deep underground that it remains largely intact, one source said. The assessment was based on satellite imagery and signals intelligence, which is gleaned from the communications of Iranian officials, one of the sources said. Current and former national security officials have expressed concerns that leaving Iran with any residual nuclear capabilities — including access to uranium already enriched to 60% and working centrifuges — could intensify and accelerate the regime's determination to create a working weapon. Some of the details contained in the DIA assessment were previously reported by CNN. The White House has pushed back on the findings. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt called the assessment ""flat-out wrong"" and said it was leaked ""by an anonymous, low-level loser in the intelligence community."" ""The leaking of this alleged assessment is a clear attempt to demean President Trump, and discredit the brave fighter pilots who conducted a perfectly executed mission to obliterate Iran's nuclear program,"" Leavitt said. ""Everyone knows what happens when you drop fourteen 30,000 pound bombs perfectly on their targets: total obliteration."" The Pentagon also stood by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's prior claim that the strikes had ""obliterated"" Iran's nuclear capabilities. ""The impact of those bombs is buried under a mountain of rubble in Iran; so anyone who says the bombs were not devastating is just trying to undermine the President and the successful mission,"" Hegseth said in a statement. Mr. Trump ordered strikes Saturday on Iran's Fordo and Natanz uranium enrichment sites, as well as a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The operation — carried out with B-2 bombers and submarine-launched cruise missiles — added to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against Iranian nuclear and military sites, drawing Iranian counterattacks . A ceasefire between Israel and Iran took effect Tuesday and appears to be holding. The strikes were aimed at stymying Iran's nuclear program. Iran has boosted its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent months, prompting concerns it was advancing toward a weapon. But Israel has alleged Iran is ""racing towards a nuclear bomb,"" and Mr. Trump said last week he believed Iran was ""very close to having one."" Iran has insisted its nuclear program is peaceful.",2025-06-24T17:17:40.021315

Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget — and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines. During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making. They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls ""one big beautiful bill,"" which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid , a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage. ""If there isn't a funding mechanism in place, if there isn't an act of Congress to replace that revenue stream, hospitals are going to close. People are going to die. ... That's the consequence of your policies,"" Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan of Massachusetts said. The Trump administration has already made cuts to funding for research at the National Institutes of Health and other resource and treatment programs. ""This isn't a budget, it's a death sentence,"" said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, referring to proposed cuts to the HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated . Carter submitted to the record what he described as a ""whole bunch of studies (that) debunk"" many of Kennedy's claims and prove he's not ""being forthright with us or the American people."" Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York allowed Kennedy to respond to what Langworthy described as Carter's ""outlandish claims."" Kennedy said he's committed to doing ""evidence-based, gold-standard science"" to take care of ""the most desperate, most vulnerable Americans, including people of HIV."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the ""broken status quo,"" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is ""never an easy task. Here are some other highlights from the hearing. RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to ""defend the indefensible"" with his actions as secretary. ""There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,"" Pallone said. ""The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions."" Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to ""major decisions about vaccines."" ""Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?"" he said. ""You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this."" Kennedy said the ACIP committee — the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices — was the public process for regulating vaccines. ""You fired the ACIP committee ,"" Pallone said. ""I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,"" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with new picks , including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for ""impugning the reputation of a member of Congress."" Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone. Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's ""defend the spend"" initiative , which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it. ""Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?"" DeGette asked. ""About what?"" Kennedy asked. ""The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?"" she repeated. ""No,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils In defense of his NIH funding cuts , Kennedy said he cut ""thousands of studies"" that were doing ""nothing to improve American health"" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research. ""Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,"" Kennedy said. ""NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are — what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?"" Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts. COVID vaccines and pregnancy Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for childre n and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said ""study after study shows adverse events"" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed ""27 adverse events during pregnancy."" Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however, recently reiterated that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals. ""We're not depriving anybody of choice,"" Kennedy said. ""If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation."" ""Not true,"" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. ""We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true."" House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it ""extremely alarming"" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations ""without consulting the customary panel of experts."" ""You have lied to the American people"" In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of ""lying"" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel. ""But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,"" Schrier said. ""Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?"" Kennedy responded by saying he ""never made that agreement."" ""So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?"" Schrier said. ""If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,"" Kennedy said. ""It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,"" Schrier said. ""I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,"" Kennedy responded. ""Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,"" Schrier said. Republicans praise Kennedy Some Republicans referred to Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" or ""MAHA"" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, ""I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again."" Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his ""commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs."" Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue ""gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures."" Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: ""I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day."" During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it ""crashes through the red tape""; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors ; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August. ""We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,"" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors. United States Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abortion-laws-judge-rules-employers-time-off-accommodations/,MoneyWatch,2025-05-21T17:35:58-0400,Judge scraps federal rules requiring employers to give workers time off for abortions,13,892,10,3,"A federal judge on Wednesday struck down regulations requiring most U.S. employers to provide workers with time off and other accommodations for abortions. The ruling by U.S. District Judge David Joseph of the Western District of Louisiana was a victory for conservative lawmakers and religious groups who decried the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's decision to include abortion among pregnancy-related conditions in regulations on how to implement the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act , which passed in December 2022. The EEOC's decision swiftly prompted several lawsuits and eroded what had been strong bipartisan support for the law designed to strengthen the rights of pregnant workers. Joseph, who was appointed by President Trump during his first term, ruled that the EEOC exceeded its authority by including abortion in its regulations. His ruling came in two consolidated lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of Louisiana and Mississippi, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Catholic University and two Catholic dioceses. Joseph sided with the plaintiffs' argument that if Congress had intended for abortion to be covered by the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, ""It would have spoken clearly when enacting the statute, particularly given the enormous social, religious, and political importance of the abortion issue in our nation at this time."" Mississippi and Louisiana have near-total bans on abortion, except to save the life of the pregnant person or in cases of a rape that has been reported to law enforcement in Mississippi, and when there is a substantial risk of death or impairment to the patient in continuing the pregnancy and in cases where the fetus has a fatal abnormality in Louisiana. Bipartisan support for pregnant workers law The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act passed with widespread bipartisan support after a decade-long campaign by women's right advocates, who hailed it as a win for low-wage pregnant workers who have routinely been denied accommodations for everything from time off for medical appointments to the ability to sit or stand on the job. The federal law applies to employers with 15 or more employees. While the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 prohibits employers from firing pregnant workers, the law did little to guarantee that women would receive accommodations they might need at work. As a result, many women were forced to keep working under unsafe conditions, or were forced to take unpaid leave by employers who refused to accommodate their needs. But many Republican lawmakers, including Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy, who co-sponsored the bill, were furious when the EEOC stated that the law covered abortions. The EEOC's commissioners approved the rules in a 3-2 vote along party lines, with both Republican commissioners voting against it. Joseph vacated the provision of the EEOC regulations that included abortion as a ""related medical condition"" of pregnancy and childbirth. However, the rest of the regulations still stand. ""Victory! A federal court has granted Louisiana's request to strike down an EEOC rule requiring employers to accommodate employees' purely elective abortions. This is a win for Louisiana and for life!"" Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press. A Better Balance, the advocacy group that spearheaded a decade-long campaign for passage of the law, condemned the ruling. ""This court's decision to deny workers reasonable accommodations for abortion-related needs is part of a broader attack on women's rights and reproductive freedom,"" A Better Balance President Inimai Chettiar said in a statement. EEOC adrift Wednesday's ruling comes as the Trump administration has moved to impose tumultuous changes at the EEOC that will almost certainly lead the agency to eventually rewrite the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act regulations. President Trump fired two of the EEOC's democratic commissioners before their terms ended, paving the way for him to establish a Republican majority and make major policy changes on how to interpret and enforce the nation's workplace civil rights laws. For now, Mr. Trump's move left EEOC without the quorum needed to make key decisions, including rescinding or revising regulations. The president tapped an assistant U.S. attorney in Florida, Brittany Panuccio, to fill one of the vacancies. If she confirmed by the Senate, the EEOC will regain its quorum. Acting EEOC Chair Andrea Lucas, who voted against the regulations because of the abortion provision, has said she will work to change them. Similar lawsuits challenging the abortion provision are underway, including one filed by 17 states, led by Tennessee and Arkansas. In February, an appeals court ruled that lawsuit could proceed, overturning a lower court's decision to dismiss the complaint. Under former President Joe Biden, the Justice Department had defended the EEOC against those lawsuits but it is unclear whether it will continue to do so under the Trump administration. The Justice Department did not reply to request for comment on Wednesday's ruling. Chettiar said the Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the ruling, adding to its significance. ""The impact of this is huge,"" Chettiar said in an interview with The Associated Press, calling the decision ""symbolic and a big signal of where the right is when it comes to the rights of women."" However, the Trump administration has continued defend the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act itself in a lawsuit brought by the state of Texas that seeks to overturn the law in its entirety.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/justice-dept-whistleblower-erez-reuveni-emil-bove/,World,2025-06-24T18:51:05-0400,"Justice Dept. whistleblower details senior officials' efforts to stonewall judges, ignore decisions",12,1318,22,5,"Attorney General Pam Bondi takes questions on Kilmar Abrego Garcia indictment 10:11 An ousted Justice Department attorney told Congress that senior department officials, including a former acting deputy attorney general, discussed defying federal court orders and withholding information from judges to advance the Trump administration's immigration priorities, according to a whistleblower complaint filed Tuesday. The attorney, Erez Reuveni, a veteran of over 14 years at the department who had been praised and promoted for his service, was put on leave and then fired earlier this year after his attorneys say he pushed back against three different Justice Department attempts to ""defy"" immigration-related court orders ""through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation."" While Reuveni has not spoken publicly about his departure, a whistleblower report sent to senior congressional leadership by his attorneys details how he says he was ""threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged"" in his final weeks in the department after he questioned instructions from top Justice Department officials to ignore court orders and misrepresent facts in court in three separate, high-profile standoffs between the department and federal judges over immigration cases. Among those officials was the No. 3 Justice Department official, Emil Bove. Bove nominated in May by President Trump to sit on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals and is scheduled to appear for his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday. Before his stint as a top Justice Department official, Bove represented Mr. Trump in his criminal trial in Manhattan last year. Reuveni's attorneys described in his complaint a meeting with Justice Department officials about contesting possible court orders blocking deportations under the Alien Enemies Act. He alleged that Bove, who at the time was principal assistant deputy attorney general, said that the department ""would need to consider telling the courts 'f*** you' and ignore any such court order,"" and that the deportation ""planes needed to take off no matter what."" ""Mr. Reuveni was in disbelief,"" his attorneys wrote, adding that others in the room were ""stunned"" by the suggestion that the Justice Department would tell its clients in the government to disobey court rulings against the administration. A day after the meeting, the complaint said, a Washington, D.C., federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador and ordered planes carrying the men to return back to the U.S. The Trump administration did not reroute the flights . Reuveni also said that Drew Ensign, one of his supervisors, knowingly told a judge that he didn't know if more Alien Enemies Act removals were underway — even though Ensign was present for the Justice Department meeting when Bove told his team the deportations would continue. After repeatedly voicing concerns in phone calls and emails that the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department had violated the court's orders by not returning the migrants, Reuveni said he received a phone call from a DHS attorney telling him to ""consult DOJ leadership if he had any questions"" about the decision. In a separate incident days later, Reuveni's attorneys allege that he was ""told to stop asking questions"" by senior Justice Department leaders after he attempted ""to ascertain whether DOJ had violated a court order"" in Massachusetts that blocked the removal of migrants to third-party countries with no due process, after he saw evidence that the removals were still underway. The complaint says that Yakov Roth, an assistant attorney general, called Reuveni to tell him that ""Bove was very unhappy"" that he was looking into why the removals had continued, in spite of a nationwide injunction blocking them. And in April, Reuveni unsuccessfully argued in defense of the controversial and mistaken deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, admitting in court that the man ""should not have been removed"" from the U.S. to El Salvador. In the days leading up to an initial hearing in Abrego Garcia's case, Reuveni's attorneys say he ""repeatedly and consistently requested updates on efforts to secure Mr. Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. and assurances of his safety,"" in the Salvadoran supermax prison where he was being detained. Those efforts were stonewalled, the attorneys say, after Reuveni was told by his bosses to ""stop asking for facts supporting any possible defense of the case,"" despite raising ""concerns in multiple emails to both DHS and DOS about the sufficiency of the evidence to support Mr. Abrego Garcia's alleged gang affiliation and the lack of action to correct his erroneous removal."" After Reuveni conceded in court that Abrego Garcia should not have been removed, a Maryland judge ordered him to be returned to the United States. As a result, a supervisor told Reuveni that the White House had questions as to why he didn't argue that Abrego Garcia was an alleged gang member and that the removal was justified, despite a court order to the contrary. Hours later, department leadership asked Reuveni to sign an appeal brief of the Maryland judge's order. He says he refused, telling a supervisor that he ""didn't sign up to lie."" Reuveni was placed on administrative leave shortly afterwards for, according to a letter signed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, ""failure to follow a directive from your superiors; failure to zealously advocate on behalf of the United States; and engaging in conduct prejudicial to your client."" Less than a week later, Reuveni was fired. Reuveni's attorneys said that the consequences of the Justice Department actions alleged by Reuveni ""have grave impacts not only for the safety of individuals removed from the country in violation of court orders, but also for the constitutional rights and protections of all persons – citizen and noncitizen alike – who are potential victims of flagrant, deliberate disregard of due process and the rule of law by the agency charged with upholding it."" The whistleblower account was first reported by the New York Times. In a post on X following the article's publication, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Reuveni's account contains ""falsehoods purportedly made by a disgruntled former employee,"" and said he was in the meeting where Bove allegedly said he would not follow court orders. Blanche said that ""at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed."" The Justice Department also defended Bove's handling of the deportation cases. ""Having entered office with a mandate to end the invasion of illegal alien criminals, Emil Bove has been a relentless advocate for the enforcement of our immigration laws and the removal of violent killers, terrorist gang leaders, and child predators, all of whom should never have been allowed to invade our borders, which is why Emil will be an outstanding federal judge to keep our country safe and uphold the rights of all Americans,"" the department said in a statement. A statement by Sen. Dick Durbin, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Reuveni's claims ""not only speak to Mr. Bove's failure to fulfill his ethical obligations as a lawyer, but demonstrate that his activities are part of a broader pattern by President Trump and his allies to undermine the Justice Department's commitment to the rule of law.""

At least six figures, many Americans say.",18,430,18,5,"New data on wage growth for people staying at current jobs 02:20 A huge swath of Americans feels under pressure to earn big bucks simply to keep pace with the rising cost of living, a new survey suggests. A poll by Bankrate found that nearly half of respondents think they need to early at least $100,00 a year to live comfortably, while a quarter said they need to make at least $150,000. To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm. Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate. ""Times have shifted,"" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. ""Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury."" As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures . If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4% , up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate. According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more. By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure. Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey. Finance Inflation United States Census Bureau",2025-06-24T17:17:46.569708

A new study says policies curb litter – by a lot,18,609,15,7,"Plastic bag regulations have led to significant decrease in shoreline litter, study finds 03:37 State and local policies to regulate the use of plastic bags have significantly reduced how many of them are found littered along U.S. shorelines — potentially cutting that type of waste in half in certain places, a new study published Thursday in the journal Science found. More than 600 bag policies, along with records from more than 45,000 shoreline cleanups between 2017 and 2023, were reviewed by researchers to see whether implementing bans or fees on plastic bags led to fewer discarded bags found near coastlines, rivers and lakes – and if they did, to what extent. Co-authors environmental economist Anna Papp and Kimberly Oremus, a marine science and policy professor at the University of Delaware, found that the number of plastic bags collected as shoreline litter in places with bag policies dropped by at least 25%, and up to 47% over six years than in locations that did not have regulations. ""When we found the database that had information on different shoreline cleanups, we realized we could look at the composition of litter before and after a policy to see what effect it had,"" Oremus said in a statement. ""And then we could compare that to places that never got a plastic bag policy."" These results bring fresh insights to an issue that gained prominence over the last decade or so, as awareness spread about the harms of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments . Oremus said it's the first attempt to comprehensively review the effectiveness of plastic bag policies on shoreline litter, using a database of global shoreline cleanup initiatives from the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy. A plastic bag on the banks of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., on March 21, 2019. Since 2018, more than 100 countries around the world have implemented some form of policy to either ban or limit the use of plastic bags, according to a report by the United Nations Environment Program. The U.S. doesn't have a federal bag policy, but individual towns, cities and states have policies of their own. Some states, like New York, have completely banned retailers from distributing plastic bags. Others, like Washington, passed partial bans in recent years, where thinner plastic bags deemed ""single use"" are prohibited, but thicker plastic bags are not. Oremus and Papp noted in the study that, although those thicker bags are usually considered ""reusable"" under partial bans, ""there is evidence that some consumers still treat them as single-use."" In multiple states without bans, local jurisdictions such as counties have taken steps to regulate plastic bag use. For example, Arlington County, Virginia, requires stores to collect a fee from customers who purchase plastic bags, at 5 cents per bag. But 17 states prevent plastic bag regulations even at the county level, with statewide ""preemption"" laws in place to ensure the distribution of these bags isn't regulated at all. During the study period, plastic bag litter was collected less often in shoreline cleanups that took place in areas where some form of regulation existed to curb their distribution and use, the authors said. ""Our findings make clear that plastic bag policies have been broadly effective in limiting—but not eliminating—shoreline plastic bag debris in jurisdictions where it was previously prevalent,"" Oremus and Papp wrote in the study. They also found evidence that suggests fees on plastic bags are more effective at limiting shoreline litter than bans, especially partial bans, but understanding why would require more research.

Monica called her partnership with Brandy a ""musical marriage."" ""We created the communication and the relationship to do it,"" she said. The tour marks a historic reunion for the duo whose 1998 duet spent a record-breaking 13 consecutive weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, placing them alongside Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey as artists who have commanded the chart's top spot for 13 weeks or more. The song gained momentum again after the pair made a surprise appearance in Ariana Grande 's ""The Boy is Mine"" music video last year, sparking viral interest and earning them a Grammy nomination for their remix collaboration more than 25 years after winning their first Grammy for the original song. Joining them are Grammy winner Kelly Rowland , chart-topping singer-songwriter Muni Long and 2025 American Idol winner Jamal Roberts. The original song became one of the most iconic collaborations in late '90s R&B and it earned the duo a Grammy for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals in 1999. The announcement comes after years of reported tension between the two artists, which both singers acknowledged during the interview. ""There was a lot of confusion and conflict and there was a lot of people around,"" Monica said. Despite the song's romantic theme about competing for the same man, both artists say they don't share the same taste in partners. ""We don't even like the same type of boy…there could never have been a boy,"" said Monica. The singers said choosing songs from both their catalogs will be tough. ""That part is hard.

Kennedy Jr. testified Tuesday in front of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce over the department's 2026 budget — and lawmakers grilled him on an array of topics, from federal funding cuts to vaccines. During their five minutes of questioning each, several Democratic representatives called out the secretary for what they said are a lack of transparency and a lack of science in decision-making. They also criticized proposed health funding cuts outlined in President Trump's domestic policy legislation, or what he calls ""one big beautiful bill,"" which is currently being debated in the Senate. The bill includes changes to Medicaid , a program that provides government-sponsored health care, which could leave many low-income and disabled Americans without coverage. ""If there isn't a funding mechanism in place, if there isn't an act of Congress to replace that revenue stream, hospitals are going to close. People are going to die. ... That's the consequence of your policies,"" Democratic Rep. Lori Trahan of Massachusetts said. The Trump administration has already made cuts to funding for research at the National Institutes of Health and other resource and treatment programs. ""This isn't a budget, it's a death sentence,"" said Rep. Marc Veasey, a Democrat from Texas, referring to proposed cuts to the HHS's Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration . The agency announced last week that a part of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to LGBTQ+ youth is being terminated . Carter submitted to the record what he described as a ""whole bunch of studies (that) debunk"" many of Kennedy's claims and prove he's not ""being forthright with us or the American people."" Republican Rep. Nick Langworthy of New York allowed Kennedy to respond to what Langworthy described as Carter's ""outlandish claims."" Kennedy said he's committed to doing ""evidence-based, gold-standard science"" to take care of ""the most desperate, most vulnerable Americans, including people of HIV."" Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. Many of the Republican committee members came to Kennedy's defense, including Florida Rep. Kat Cammack, who congratulated Kennedy for disrupting the ""broken status quo,"" and Iowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, who said restructuring is ""never an easy task. Here are some other highlights from the hearing. RFK Jr. retracts accusation against Rep. Frank Pallone Democratic Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey accused Kennedy of trying to ""defend the indefensible"" with his actions as secretary. ""There's no way that this budget or the actions you have taken thus far as secretary are going to make this country healthier,"" Pallone said. ""The science is not on your side. I just really think that people are going to die as a result of your actions."" Pallone also criticized Kennedy for not allowing for a typical process of public comments when it comes to ""major decisions about vaccines."" ""Are you just afraid of receiving public comments on proposals where you just think these are fringe views that are contrary to the views of most scientists and that the public comments will reflect this?"" he said. ""You say you want transparency, but there's been no public process for any of this."" Kennedy said the ACIP committee — the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices — was the public process for regulating vaccines. ""You fired the ACIP committee ,"" Pallone said. ""I fired people who had conflicts with the pharmaceutical industry,"" Kennedy replied. Earlier this month, he replaced the entire committee with new picks , including some with ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. Later, Kennedy accused Pallone of taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, which prompted fellow Democratic Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado to call for a point of order for ""impugning the reputation of a member of Congress."" Chairman Buddy Carter, a Georgia Republican, asked Kennedy if he wanted to take it back, and Kennedy retracted his comments about Pallone. Earlier in the hearing, DeGette questioned Kennedy on the White House's Department of Government Efficiency's ""defend the spend"" initiative , which the Washington Post reports has caused thousands of backed-up payments to doctors and nurses. Kennedy denied knowing about it. ""Do you know anything about the 'defend the spend' initiative?"" DeGette asked. ""About what?"" Kennedy asked. ""The 'defend the spend' initiative that your agency has?"" she repeated. ""No,"" Kennedy said. Kennedy defends NIH funding cuts, talks seed oils In defense of his NIH funding cuts , Kennedy said he cut ""thousands of studies"" that were doing ""nothing to improve American health"" and instead offered other topics he thinks should be a focus of research. ""Very few of the studies that were being done by NIH were being done on chronic disease,"" Kennedy said. ""NIH should be telling us: what are seed oils doing to our children? What are — what is corn syrup doing to our children? What are food dyes doing to our children? What is the packaging and microplastics doing to our children? What are pesticides doing to our children?"" Kennedy also claimed he doesn't know about the letter to NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya earlier this month from NIH scientists criticizing the administration's deep funding cuts. COVID vaccines and pregnancy Kennedy said last month that he would remove the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation for childre n and healthy pregnant women to get vaccinated against COVID-19. At Tuesday's hearing, Kennedy said ""study after study shows adverse events"" after COVID-19 shots during pregnancy. Without citing where the study came from, Kennedy said one study showed ""27 adverse events during pregnancy."" Officials at the Food and Drug Administration, however, recently reiterated that pregnancy was among the underlying conditions that warranted continued eligibility for COVID-19 vaccine approvals. ""We're not depriving anybody of choice,"" Kennedy said. ""If a pregnant woman wants the COVID-19 vaccine, she can get it. We're no longer recommending it because there was no science supporting that recommendation."" ""Not true,"" Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Illinois rebutted. ""We have a pediatrician that is on this committee. Not true."" House Democrat Kim Schrier of Washington is a former pediatrician, who said during her allotted time that she found it ""extremely alarming"" that Kennedy announced changes to vaccine recommendations ""without consulting the customary panel of experts."" ""You have lied to the American people"" In her line of questioning, Schrier accused Kennedy of ""lying"" to a U.S. senator about not making any changes to the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and doctor, eventually voted to confirm Kennedy for HHS secretary. Kennedy denied lying to the senator about the vaccine panel. ""But then two weeks ago, you fired all 17 experts on that very committee,"" Schrier said. ""Did you lie to Sen. Cassidy when you told him you would not change this panel of experts?"" Kennedy responded by saying he ""never made that agreement."" ""So are you saying that Senator Cassidy lied when he was on the Senate floor, lied to the American people?"" Schrier said. ""If he said that I agreed to it, it would be inaccurate,"" Kennedy said. ""It sounds to me like you gave him the answer he needed to hear in order to get his confirmation vote, and then as soon as you were secretary, you turned around and did whatever you want,"" Schrier said. ""I'm complying with all the agreements I made with Sen. Cassidy,"" Kennedy responded. ""Mr. Secretary, you're now on the record. You lied to Sen. Cassidy. You have lied to the American people, you have lied to parents about vaccines for 20 years, and I also want to be clear that I will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet,"" Schrier said. Republicans praise Kennedy Some Republicans referred to Kennedy's ""Make America Healthy Again"" or ""MAHA"" motto, including Langworthy, who told the secretary, ""I appreciate your leadership and your vision and your efforts to make America healthy again."" Dr. John Joyce, a Pennsylvania Republican and a dermatologist who serves as vice-chair of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, thanked Kennedy for his ""commitments to unlocking American science that we know will lead to additional breakthroughs."" Kennedy told Joyce he was committed to ensuring incentives for innovators are put in place to pursue ""gold standard science for rare disease treatments and for their cures."" Virginia Republican Morgan Griffith, seemingly making a comparison to Kennedy, said: ""I would remind everybody that Galileo got an 'F' during his day and age, and that sometimes people who are trying to do cutting-edge work don't get the response they expect from leading scientists of the day."" During the hearing, Kennedy made other commitments to Republicans lawmakers, including expanding the use of the Trump administration's new FDA priority vouchers because it ""crashes through the red tape""; speeding access to prescription psychedelics; urging all Americans to use wearables like glucose monitors ; promoting non-opioid painkiller Journavx; and redoing the dietary guidelines by August. ""We're about to launch one of the biggest advertising campaigns in HHS history,"" Kennedy said, referring to the glucose monitors. United States Department of Health and Human Services Robert F.

The federal statistics show nearly half — or 47% — of those currently detained by ICE lack a criminal record and fewer than 30% have been convicted of crimes, a sign of the widening scope of President Trump's escalating crackdown on illegal immigration. On the campaign trail, Mr. Trump vowed to expel dangerous criminal migrants, though top officials in his administration have said no one in the U.S. illegally will be immune from deportation. ICE can detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally — as well as foreigners whose legal status is under review for potential revocation, including in cases involving criminal offenses — while the agency attempts to deport them. As the agency spearheading federal efforts to carry out Mr. Trump's promised mass deportation campaign, ICE has garnered national headlines in recent weeks, as its operations have become more visible, expansive and, in the eyes of critics, aggressive. High-profile ICE operations at workplaces and other locations in the Los Angeles area earlier this month triggered large-scale protests, including some instances of violence, which Mr. Trump cited to activate National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to protect federal property and officers. Internal agency figures show ICE has averaged around 1,200 daily arrests so far in June, with arrests surpassing 2,000 on two days. That's nearly double the 660 daily arrest average during the first 100 days of President Trump's second administration, but it's still far below the 3,000 arrests top White House adviser Stephen Miller has said ICE should conduct every day. The 59,000 detainee population tops the previous peak in 2019, when the first Trump administration held as many as 55,000 immigrants in ICE detention, according to agency data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University. Historical data gathered by the Marshall Project suggests the 59,000 figure is the highest in the history of U.S. immigration detention. Two former senior ICE officials said they had never seen the agency holding that many detainees. ""If ICE is holding 59,000 immigrants in civil detention across the country, it would be the highest number on record that I'm aware of,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who studies the U.S. immigration system. The current detention level is a 50% increase from the last days of the Biden administration, when ICE was holding around 39,000 detainees. Figures show it has mainly been driven by ICE arrests in the interior of the country, as opposed to transfers of migrants who just crossed the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings have dropped to historic lows. Over 70% of the detainees in ICE custody were arrested in the U.S. interior, the government figures show, up from fewer than 40% when the Biden administration left office. ICE has been able to increase its arrest rate through various means, including through large-scale operations in locations across the U.S. supported by Customs and Border Protection, the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal law enforcement agencies. In addition, many of those arrested by ICE are inmates picked up at local and state jails as part of a longstanding program targeting noncitizens with criminal records. But the Trump administration has also vastly expanded who is subject to being detained by ICE, reversing limits placed by previous administration that largely required the agency to focus on arresting serious criminals, national security threats and recent arrivals. The administration also lifted a Biden-era pause on immigration roundups at worksites, launching arrest operations at a meat processing plant in Nebraska and a horse racetrack in Louisiana . It's unclear how the Trump administration has expanded ICE's detention capacity beyond the beds funded by Congress. Officials have been looking into converting some military bases, like Fort Bliss in Texas, into temporary immigration holding centers, though those plans have not fully materialized. The administration has also asked Congress for billions of dollars in extra funds for ICE, including to expand detention levels by tens of thousands of beds. Recently, Florida state officials offered to build several immigration detention sites to support the Trump administration, including one in the Everglades dubbed ""Alligator Alcatraz."" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Florida would receive federal funds to set up those facilities. Representatives for DHS and ICE did not respond to questions about whether some detention facilities are over capacity. In a statement, ICE said its effort to target a ""massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States"" has led to ""a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity."" ""ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,"" ICE added, noting the ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" backed by the president would fund 100,000 detention beds. Kocher, the Syracuse University professor, said he's worried about conditions in ICE detention deteriorating amid the rapid expansion in the detainee population. ""I am concerned about ICE's ability to comply with the basic standards of civil detention or provide appropriate due process to immigrants — both of which the administration has so far treated as optional rather than required by law,"" Kocher said.

Here's what to know about symptoms, causes.",13,390,20,4,"How men's minds and bodies may change after they become parents 04:09 Postpartum depression isn't just something new moms can struggle with — studies show new dads can also be affected. In the United States, about 1 in 7 women experiences postpartum depression — but more awareness is being brought to men, who can also experience the mental health condition associated with intense feelings of sadness, anxiety and exhaustion. Postpartum depression symptoms in men Symptoms of postpartum depression symptoms in men ""can be tricky,"" LaPook said, as they might be mistaken as something else. ""When you're a new father, a new parent, you're tired, you may be sad, you may feel like out of control, but there are some specific things that are very typical of postpartum depression in men,"" he said, including: Increase in irritability or anger Increased isolation Increase in risky behavior, including things like gambling and substance abuse What causes postpartum depression in men? Both physiological and environmental factors play a role in men developing postpartum depression. While men don't have as dramatic of hormonal changes as women do during pregnancy, LaPook said there are studies showing testosterone level can go down during and after a partner's pregnancy. ""The skin-to-skin that women want to have with the baby — now they're encouraging skin-to-skin with men, because it's been shown, even just holding the baby, to increase oxytocin levels and bonding,"" he said. Sleepless nights with a newborn and new parent worries also play a role in mental health. ""It's a combination as always,"" he said. ""We all remember those times in the middle of the night when you feel out of control."" And while studies show men have the highest levels of postpartum depression during the first 3 to 6 months after birth, LaPook says it's important to remember it can happen anytime. ""You really want to be aware of it,"" he said, adding research shows postpartum depression can have a lasting negative impact on kids. Depression Childbirth",2025-06-24T17:17:54.740154

The statement from Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general for UNRWA, criticizing the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) came as the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said 79 people had been killed in the Palestinian territory over the previous 24 hours, 51 of whom it said had died near GHF sites. Another man at Nasser hospital said: ""I send this message to the mothers and fathers, not to send their children. Youngsters who are barely 17 are dying in vain, just to get some hummus or a bag of flour to feed their families. The Israeli army lies in wait to kill them as you can see here. Look at the victims here. Most of them have been shot in their heads. This American charity is a trap of those youngsters. Young people in their prime are dying. This is a trap.""

Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto/Getty ""Humanitarian principles must be reinstated,"" Lazzarini said in his statement. ""The humanitarian community, including UNRWA, has the expertise and must be allowed to do their jobs and provide assistance with respect and dignity."" ""In Gaza, atrocities continue while global attention shifts elsewhere,"" Lazzarini said after 12 days of air and missile strikes between Israel and Iran . ""A confined and captive population is bombarded, besieged and constantly displaced. More than 55,000 people are reported killed, most of them women and children. Two million people are being starved, among them 1 million children. We have said it several times and I say it once again: no place is safe in Gaza, and no one is spared."" GHF said in a statement on Tuesday that distribution ""at all sites proceeded without incident. However, today GHF formally raised complaints with the IDF regarding instances of possible harassment by Israeli soldiers directed at our convoys"" headed to one of its aid hubs. The group also pushed back, as it does in all of its daily statements, against what it called ""false allegations of attacks near aid distributions sites,"" and it added that the ""Hamas-affiliated Gaza Health Ministry is not a credible source of information, as it fails to report any UN convoys or distribution sites that are linked to violent incidents."" A boy mourns over the body of a man killed a day earlier while attempting to get aid at a distribution point near the Israeli-controlled Zikim border crossing, during a funeral service at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City, June 24, 2025. The U.N.'s aid agencies and private organizations have refused to work with GHF, saying it violates humanitarian principles because it allows Israel to control who receives aid and forces people to relocate to distribution sites, causing yet more mass displacement in the Palestinian enclave. ""Bottomline, our aid is getting securely delivered. Instead of bickering and throwing insults from the sidelines, we would welcome the UN and other humanitarian groups to join us and feed the people in Gaza. We are ready to collaborate and help them get their aid to people in need,"" GHF said. Israel and the United States have said the new GHF-organized system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid, which the U.S.-designated terrorist organization denies doing. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors. Meanwhile, a limited number of trucks carrying humanitarian aid for the U.S.-based World Central Kitchen nonprofit group were reported to have entered the Gaza Strip. COGAT, the agency that coordinates Israel's operations in the Palestinian territories under the authority of the country's Ministry of Defense, said over half a million pounds of baby food had entered Gaza Monday. The Israel Defense Forces said 79 trucks from various aid organizations carrying food and medical supplies had entered Gaza on Monday. Before and during much of the ongoing war in Gaza, UNRWA provided education, health care, humanitarian relief and social services to hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees in multiple countries across the Middle East, but the group has long been accused by Israeli authorities of links to terrorism. In January, two Israeli laws came into effect banning UNRWA operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Israeli officials accused a dozen UNRWA staff members in Gaza of being complicit in the Hamas-orchestrated Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack that sparked the war. UNRWA's Lazzarini, following an internal U.N. investigation, fired nine staff members , but said the agency's priority remained ""to continue lifesaving and critical services for Palestine refugees in Gaza and across the region."" UNRWA later said the Israeli government had not provided any evidence for its accusations, a position which was supported by a later independent U.N. review. However, the allegations against UNRWA prompted the U.S. government to temporarily pause its funding for the agency, and President Trump, earlier this year, made the end of American support for the agency indefinite. In March, UNRWA issued a public appeal for a resumption of the American funding. ""UNRWA's financial situation is dire,"" Lazzarini said Tuesday. ""Cash flow is managed now on a weekly basis instead of monthly let alone yearly. Without additional funding, I will soon have to take unprecedented decisions affecting our services to Palestine Refugees across the region. The loss of UNRWA's stabilising effect on a region increasingly in turmoil will also be consequential."" Lazzarini stressed that UNRWA provides a range of services to Palestinian refugees that a functioning Palestinian state , if one were to be created, could take over, including education and medical care. ""A genuine, time-bound political process would allow the Agency to finally transition its government-like services to empowered and prepared public institutions serving Palestinians,"" he said. ""In the absence of an orderly transition, the sudden loss or reduction of UNRWA's services will only deepen suffering and despair across the occupied Palestinian territory. It might spark unrest in the neighbouring countries. This is something that the region cannot afford, especially now.""

Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December. In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation ""could be short lived"" or ""could instead be more persistent."" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices. By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates. But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses. ""For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,"" Powell said in the testimony. He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become ""an ongoing inflation problem."" Powell is ""unbending under pressure,"" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. ""Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations."" Fed officials push for cut Two Fed officials — Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller — have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30. On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise. ""It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,"" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. ""Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting."" Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize. ""The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,"" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, ""We will get to a place where we cut rates."" At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows. ""Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,"" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. ""The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29."" Jerome Powell Interest Rates Federal Reserve",2025-06-24T17:17:58.054836

Here's what to know about their wedding.,18,808,25,10,"Residents of Venice, Italy raise concerns about Jeff Bezos' wedding 01:40 Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to tie the knot in Italy this week, even as local frustrations mount over the multi-million dollar event. Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background. Where and when is the wedding? Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location. The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019 . Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019. The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore, according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s. A picture shows The Giorgio Cini Foundation on the island of San Giorgio in Venice, which according to Italian media could be one of the locations for the wedding between Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez. A protest group called ""No Space for Bezos"" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported. How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost? The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail. About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking. Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion , according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion) Who is attending? Bezos and Sanchez invited about 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests said to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump. According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport. Who is Lauren Sanchez? Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023 . Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight , which included ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the idea for a female-led flight to Bezos , the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021. What are the wedding protests about? Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs. This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates. Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the "" No Space for Bezos "" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups. People gather to protest against the wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025, with some local residents claiming the city is catering to billionaires. Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: ""IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX."" Local police folded up the banner and took it away. Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated. In March, the city issued a statement denying reports that there would be any major disruption to daily Venetian life, even with hundreds expected to descend on the city this week for the wedding. Venice and the surrounding metropolitan area has a population of roughly 250,000, according to Statista . But fewer than 50,000 people live in the city's historic district, which is composed over 100 islands connected by Venice's famous canals and footbridges.
