Promising review: ""This is amazing!!!!! It looks like a different fireplace. I have been looking at a horrible grout repair that the previous owners did for 20 years.

OK, so painting your concrete patio may not sound like the easiest upgrade but if you're no stranger to painting and want a big impact, give it a try! Promising review: ""Works great. Used it in the basement for a quick, simple, inexpensive upgrade to brighten up the floor a bit and give the cement a clean look. Did a fairly good job filling in some of the hairline cracks as well."" — T Get a gallon from Amazon for $35+ (available in silver gray or slate gray). Promising reviews: ""I absolutely, LOVE this litter box cabinet. I used to keep it in my closet until noticing my clothes would have a chalky film on them. This is perfect! ! Not only does it hide the box itself, but it helps contain any smells that are beginning to emanate from the box. I clean it out every other day and have never noticed any odors. I also took out the divider, because my box was a few inches too long. All changing supplies are kept inside, so it works out great! I HIGHLY recommend, this litter box cabinet!!"" — Angie ""This is the perfect way to conceal a litter box as well as the odors and dust that come with them. I have noticed a significant difference in the air quality in my home, it is as if I don't even have a litter box."" — Annie Get it from Wayfair for $75.99+ (originally $79.99; available in five colors). While restoring a finish isn't quite the same as completely refinishing a piece, it takes much less time and can still make furniture (and floors , front doors , and kitchen cabinets ) look magically new again. Promising review: ""Very easy to get results. I applied to eight dining room chairs which had scrapes, scuffs, and white paint marks. An amazing transformation so quickly. I finished eight chairs in 90 minutes without rushing. I bought two pints but only one was necessary. I used a cotton cloth for most of the application but also used 0000 steel wool for the scrapes and paint removal."" — Grumpy Neanderthal Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in eight wood finish colors; also available in larger sizes ). Many reviewers follow up with the same brand's wood polish and conditioner (they're meant to be used together!), which you can get for $10.47 from Amazon. Former BuzzFeed Shopping editor Abby Kass says: ""I used a similar kit on my TV stand after moving it into my current apartment, and it worked great! It was super easy to use — you just color in the scratch. And you can't tell the difference. It's amazing! And next time I move, I'm def hiring movers."" Promising reviews: ""I can’t believe how well these work! Much better than I was expecting. I just had my home interior painted, and the painters damaged a fiberboard medicine cabinet when they removed the masking tape. It ripped off the fake-wood veneer. These markers completely filled in the ugly spots, and the colors blended well. I love that it appears to have some clear coat in it, too, as it dries with a slight shine that makes it look more like wood stain rather than marker. I also used them to stain wood filler in two spots in my maple kitchen cabinets where a previous homeowner had hung a paper towel holder, and I really struggle to see the hole! It looks fantastic. I highly recommend this set. It’s a good value and works very well."" — Shane ""These are great. I have several finishes on different pieces of furniture, and after several years, they were showing lots of scratches. Not anymore. Super easy to use and covered everything. Wasn't sure after paying such a minimal price that they'd work, but they really do."" — Kindle Customer Get a set of 13 markers from Amazon for $13.99 . You can also line the top of a pergola with these vines for some shade, letting a bit of dappled sunlight pass through for a gorgeous effect! Promising review: ""This was exactly what we needed for the backyard. It definitely provides enough privacy, and it gives the backyard a very nice ambiance! The leaves completely blend in with the other trees and plants we have in the backyard, and it looks like we made a huge upgrade in our gardening game. I'm now just hoping it can withstand the AZ summer and not fade with the sun (product description does state fade resistant). Don't be hesitant with purchasing; it's totally worth it!!"" — Amazon Customer Get a roll from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in three sizes). You'll need some green zip ties to secure them, too. You can use these for so much more than clothing! Think craft supplies, extra toiletries, shoes...basically whatever you have too much of. Promising review: "" These storage bags are fantastic. I live in a small apartment where storage space is at a premium. I use these to store my Costco toilet paper and paper towels so I don't need to make as many trips to the store. It keeps them in pristine condition and out of sight. The handles make them easy to pull in and out, and they fold up nicely when not in use. I'm thinking about getting two more since four will fit under my queen bed."" — Kimberly Dorn Get a two-pack from Amazon for $12.97+ (available in three colors and in packs of four). Promising review: ""Looks great — really ‘finishes’ off the look. Ironed very easily and looks really nice. Material is very soft and holds the pleat."" — AM Get it from Target for $27.99+ (available in seven sizes and 10 colors). Promising review : ""These look great and are super easy to apply. This is the perfect solution for hiding a cord! It looks like it is just a part of the baseboard. Mine is covering a cable wire only, but I think they are big enough to hide more than one cord if needed. I didn’t cut mine, and I bought two. You can tell where the two meet if you look closely. However, I do not think anyone would notice. I can’t believe I let our cable cord sit across the floor for this long. I wish I would have found these sooner! "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in three sizes, five colors, and in multipacks). Promising review: ""I usually don't leave reviews, but I have to with this touchup paint. I had cheap command hooks on my wall to hang up my curtains in my apartment, and they ended up falling off and damaging the wall. I brought this to cover it up since it was an eyesore, and this worked perfectly! Thankfully, I matched the right shade, and you can't even tell. It's easy to use and not messy at all. Once it dries, it instantly blends in. I'm glad it worked so well because now I can put more stuff on my walls and fix it with the paint so it won't affect my security deposit, LOL."" — N.D. Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in three sizes, 26 colors, and in sets of three). Clare is a Black woman-owned business that makes paint shopping easier than ever. These designer-curated palettes are sure to take your home to the next level! And if you're not sure what colors to go with, take Clare's Color Genius Quiz !

Exactly what I wanted and after shopping around and seeing prices ranging from $1k to $700 the price is unbeatable! Turned my dining room into a room out of a model home! "" — JH ""Wow, I just hung up this ceiling light, and my room’s got a whole new vibe! It’s got a great look, feels sturdy, and the quality’s seriously impressive. It gives off the perfect amount of cozy light, and it’s pretty stylish, too. Super happy with this find!"" — Jon Get it from Amazon for $121.59+ (available in six styles). Promising review: ""Power washer was delivered Monday, it’s Wednesday and I have washed two cars, cleaned driveway and sidewalks, cleaned back fence and the work keeps piling up , everything I see now needs to be cleaned! This little dude does not back down, plenty of power and it's surprisingly not too loud. Soap dispensers work great, and the tips are easy to change."" — MAR Get it from Amazon for $169.15 . Promising review: ""This was recommended to me by a guy who sold us redwood boards from his mill. It went on easily and it looks gorgeous! I stained a fence and two decks in the last three years and this product is far superior right off the bat. Love the richness of the color and the wood is soaking it up consistently."" — I Know Jack Get a 1-gallon can from Amazon for $32.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""This was very easy to install to hide all the messy wires. This is life changing to create a nice, sleek space."" — Martha Ashley Get it from Amazon for $21.95+ (available in four lengths and two configurations). Promising review : ""This decorative storage box looks like a carved art piece. I use it in my living room to hide remotes, reading glasses, dental floss, etc."" — Free Spirit Get it from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in three sizes and three colors). The adjustable cord measures 5.5 feet. It does not include bulbs, but you can get a set of compatible Edison bulbs here . Promising review: ""Love these green pendants above our island. The color is a perfect muted olive green and the wood accent just elevates the look. For reference our island is 8ft long and three of these lights fit perfectly."" — Jay Stanford Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in four colors). Promising reviews: ""Bought a house with canned lights everywhere. I wanted a few semi-flush, pendants and chandeliers so I tried this product. Very easy to install and works like a charm. "" — PJG123 ""It may take a bit of finessing and maybe an extra hole drilled here or there but it will eventually do what it is supposed to do. I now have a surface- mounted light on my front porch instead of the can light the builder supplied. We turned a dark ugly space into a wonderfully lit beautiful space. We are amazed at the transformation this lighting change made to our home. Would do this again in a second."" — TDC Get it from Amazon for $21.44 . The 35-quart container comes with all the mounting hardware you'll need. Promising review: ""I hesitated to trade existing storage space for a trashcan but I am so glad I did. The Rev-A-Shelf was easy to install and worked exactly as I expected. The instructions were a bit lacking but a quick check on YouTube is all you need. Just four easily placed screws to your cupboard bottom and project complete. The fact that the kitchen trash is not the first thing guests see when they enter my house is awesome. I should have done this upgrade years ago! You won't be sorry if you purchase this unit. I love it!"" — daisy Get it from Amazon for $67.99+ (available in seven colors, or check out other options and sizes for the Rev-A-Shelf trashcan storage ). Promising reviews: ""Boy does this tape pretty up an otherwise and boring toilet. Way better than a bead of caulk. Clean....clean...clean before installation. Also helps to warm the product. Can be stretched during installation to better fit around tight bends. Been in place for a few weeks; still holding fine."" — Selaretus ""Went on easily around the toilet, [it] looks so much better. Covered discoloration around the base, highly recommend."" — Jerry Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in four sizes/styles). Promising review: ""I have a weirdly tall transition to my bathrooms and struggled with getting a normal threshold to stay in the entrance to my other bathroom after laying vinyl tile, so I hesitated on doing the hall bath until I found this product. Problem solved! Looks great and doesn’t budge! And affordable! I will definitely be ordering more for the long gap between my laminate and marble flooring in another area that I have hated for years.""— m. white Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""Changed the oil on my girlfriend's car and some oil spilled on my NEW driveway...which I didn't notice 'til four days later. Four spots all about the size of a dollar bill baking in the Arizona sun for four days. Put the stuff on (sits on the stain like pancake batter — don't be afraid to pour liberally) and let it sit from 6 p.m. 'til about 9 a.m. the next day. It dried and the instructions said to just sweep the stuff up. It broke apart with the broom and the stains were gone, just swept up the powder pieces — took about a minute. I WAS SHOCKED! Something that actually works on oil and it's easy. Absolutely NO sign of anything that was there. My driveway is smooth concrete so I can't vouch for what would happen with a rougher surface but whoever makes this stuff is a genius. If they tried to take on World Peace, Earth would be a better place."" — AmazonBob Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (also available in a larger size). Farmhouse Iron Co. is a small business based at an actual farm on the central coast of California. If you're looking for shabby-chic or rustic home decor, this is the shop for you!

Very happy with this purchase."" — Ingrid Hogan Get it from Farmhouse Iron Co. on Etsy for $13+ (available in five styles). These shelves measure 45"" x 45"" and can hold up to 250 lbs of evenly distributed weight. Promising review: ""These are a great way to open up more storage potential in the garage. This is actually my third home when I've used these in my garage. If you have lots of room between your garage door and your ceiling, these can be used up there to allow you to store stuff in a space you would otherwise not be able to use. They're great for being able to store stuff way up high and not take up any floor space . We store all of our Christmas lights and other holiday decorations on them. They hold up the weight of four or five big bins full of Christmas light strings, no problem."" — Buster Get it from Amazon for $99.99+ (available in two styles). This tapestry measures 18"" x 40"" so make sure it'll be a good fit to cover your electrical panel! Promising review: ""I bought this to cover the electric panel in our mudroom. It covers it perfectly so now it's not the first thing you see when you walk in. Had to brush out the tassels a little bit but it is good quality!"" — J. Underwood Get it from Amazon for $33.99 . Promising review: ""Best looking metal spray paint I have seen. It took me 90 minutes to prepare, mask, and paint my bathroom faucet. I used about 1/2 a can of this paint."" — OC-Adam Get it from Amazon for $9.48 (available in several metallic finish colors). Promising review: ""Super easy to install and took less than 30 min to put together, level out, and hammer in the stakes.

This DIY project is easiest if your sink or countertop already has an existing hole for a soap dispenser! This kit includes a stainless steel dispenser pump with a 360-degree swivel, a 47"" no-spill extension tube with check valve, a connecting pipe, and a 17-oz. soap bottle. You can use the extension tube in your own jug of soap (pictured above) OR you can fill the included 17-oz. bottle with your own soap instead. The kit is designed for a universal fit and can accommodate sink holes that measure between 1"" and 1.5"" in diameter. Promising review: ""It's just as described! I bought this in brushed nickel so it would match the sink! Love it! Finally, my guests can wash their hands without knocking a bottle over or shifting its spot on the sink! It can swivel 360° and comes with a longer tube, two rubber plugs to fit different-sized bottles, and an empty plastic bottle. I chose to screw on the plastic bottle directly to the dispenser so it doesn't sit on the bottom but will keep longer tube in case I change my mind later. The bottle holds on very well! The best part is when the soap runs out, I can replenish the bottle by removing the dispenser head from the top of the sink without having to crawl back under again! No tools required! Took about five minutes! Highly recommend!"" — ItsJenAgain91 Get it from Amazon for $24.95+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""I bought these to replace the ugly, plain registers that were on my ceiling. Installed in less than 10 minutes and they look beautiful. I ordered white and spray painted them nickel to match my ceiling fan. Couldn't be happier."" — AsMeow Get one from Amazon for $15.40 . This roll of self-adhesive trim measures 4 inches by 20 feet. Promising review: ""This was very easy to apply and make sure you have it where you want it before sticking because it REALLY sticks to the wall. I laid out the roll and let it relax for a day before cutting and applying. Love the easy-to-clean material. Made trimming out my bathroom/ laundry room quick and easy."" — Cassie Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in 11 sizes and seven colors). Promising review: ""[I] bought this so I could store my gardening items and kids' toys. It has been perfect. It is big enough to fit everything from my planters, gardening tools, kids' water guns, balls, etc. and it still has a lot of space. My kids use it as a bench to sit on as well. Durable and sturdy so far."" — Sid Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in eight sizes and five colors). Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T16:56:29.014377+00:00

We use consent management provider solutions (CMPs) so that you can decide who you will allow to set third party advertising and affiliate link cookies on your browser or device.

Note: this only explains what we do, not what our third party advertising partners do. If you’re in the UK or EU, you can find out who they are and see their privacy notices under “Partners” in our consent management platform.  What are “first party” cookies  We collect data from users of our websites and apps by placing a small piece of code known as a “first-party cookie” on your device when you access the website or app. First-party cookies collect data only for BuzzFeed; if an advertiser or other company wants to access this data, they must go to BuzzFeed and get permission.  You can also delete them at any time via your browser settings (usually under “clearing cached cookies” or a similar setting).  We do not use cookies that cannot be deleted via browser settings.  How does it work?  The cookie stores a unique identifier consisting of a randomized sequence of numbers and/or letters, known as the “cookie ID.”  This “cookie ID” does not contain a user’s name, email address or other contact details, age, gender, or other personal characteristics. When you interact with a BuzzFeed website or app, the website or app reads the cookie ID from the cookie stored on your device and then records your interactions with the website or the app, such as which pages you visited, whether you clicked on anything on the page (links, ads, etc.), and how long you spent on the page.  These interactions are associated with the cookie ID.  What does Buzzfeed do with this data?  We use this data for two purposes.  Firstly, we use it to analyse our users’ behaviour to help us understand how people like to use our sites and apps, what works, when demand peaks and we might need to make more bandwidth available, and so on.  This is platform maintenance and development work.  Secondly, we use it to target ads.  We explain a bit more about that below.  Data gathering for platform maintenance and development and for ad targeting use completely separate cookies, and we store the data gathered from them separately. Data gathered for development purposes is not used for ad targeting, and vice versa.  How do you target ads?  The first-party cookie used for ad-targeting does not transmit the user interaction history to BuzzFeed; it only stores this history on the user’s device and BuzzFeed cannot view the history. The cookie ID itself is transmitted to and stored by BuzzFeed servers.  When a targeted ad is served on a BuzzFeed website or app, the webpage where the ad is will read the first-party cookie on the user’s device.  The webpage sends the first-party cookie the ad-targeting parameters, which the cookie then compares to the interaction history stored on the user’s device.  If there is a match, the targeted ad is served.  If there is not a match, the targeted ad is not served.  Do other people give you data to target ads?  Sometimes one of the brands that advertises with us will ask us to target their ads to people who have visited their site, or to a subset of those people. One way to do that is for them to pass to us their own first party cookie data, so that we can recognise you as someone who has visited their site and that they want to target.  In those cases, that data is kept separate from our own data and is only used for that advertiser.  We never are allowed to directly access see the first-party cookie data provided by the brand.  The technology provider we use for our first party cookies also gives us the ability to make use of larger so-called “audience” data sets from reputable providers like Nielsen as a kind of overlay or additional filter on our own data.  However, we never actually see that underlying data.  Do you collect anything sensitive?  BuzzFeed does not collect and use information about people’s personal characteristics such as race/ethnicity, gender, age, or sexual orientation in order to target ads.  Ad-targeting is based on a user’s interests in specific content, as guessed from their interaction history.  So, for example, if a user often interacts with content categorized by BuzzFeed as related to African-American culture and interests, the user is more likely to see ads targeted to African-American culture and interests.  However, the targeting is based on their apparent interest; BuzzFeed does not assume that the user is necessarily of African-American race or heritage and does not know the user’s actual race/ethnicity.",2025-06-24T16:56:29.990321+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff — u/lamapuchita ""Anyway, I eventually dumped him. Years later, we ran into each other, and by then, I had lost all the weight and had become super fit. He proceeded to tell me he'd been single since we broke up and once again threw a tantrum about my weight, this time all upset that I was now thin and that I wasn't during our relationship. He actually used the word 'unfair.' I told him I had to go home to my husband and walked off."" — u/Slappyxo — u/Sisyfos1234 — u/morbidemadame — u/glamasaurus — u/GhostOfYourLibido ""This is my current situation, ughh. We've been dating for three months, and I just found out he has a 'sex worker addiction' that he is working on. 😭 I was in the hospital recently and generally having health problems, and yesterday, he said he couldn't FaceTime me to watch a movie together because he did too much coke the night before and didn't feel good…but that he'd call me when he felt better (he never did). I think I'm breaking up with him today. He never had a girlfriend before me."" — u/PaleNewspaper3 ""I pursued him ultimately, seeing what a nice guy he was, that he was goofy and intensely curious, and that we had things in common. Plus, I wanted to give him a chance. He was pretty nervous, sweet, and inexperienced in ways, but we talked about it. And BECAUSE we talked about it, and he is such a great big nerd, he would RESEARCH what I was bringing up, holy shit the orgasms were wild. He was dedicated, thoughtful, open to new ideas, and soooo wonderfully nerdy. Yeah, I am married to this dude now."" — u/masterpiecemixtapes ""It wasn't a disaster, but it was exhausting. I learned that it doesn't matter if you've had a thousand partners or none: what matters is your emotional maturity and your willingness to grow."" — u/No-Public6996 — u/Piksu4444 — u/DBones90 — u/Zestyclose_Visit4834 — u/shutupphil — u/coding_hobbit — u/AmyGranite ""When I immediately packed my shit and left he started crying about me being his 'best friend' and how could I abandon him like this? Easily, as it turns out. I haven't talked to him since, and that was about three years ago. So yeah. Didn't go well. Now I focus my energy exclusively on myself. No more helping people become the best version of themselves at my own expense. I hope he's living his best life, but by god, he'd better stay far out of mine."" — u/chronostrats ""He didn't answer WhatsApp, and when I called, he didn't answer the phone. I didn't pressure him; it's absolutely okay if someone needs some time to themselves to think about certain things. But no sign of life for a week...at least for me, that's not possible in a relationship. By the way, he contacted me off and on for months after I broke up. But I didn't feel like going to that kind of theater anymore."" — u/LutschiPutschi — u/Gullible-Ad7011 — u/hellouterus ""It's so sad because he is such a good man. I think he just needed someone to love him and believe in him. It's going really great between us. He has shown that he isn't afraid to change and grow while still being true to himself. If anything, it just makes me admire him more because being capable of change is a huge deal."" — u/SnooBananas8065 ""He suddenly/finally bumped into a girl we know back in the UK. They would never have been a situation where they'd have linked; it just happened by chance when he was picking up some stuff from our friend's house and stayed for food and DnD (I wasn't there)... They've been together now for a year, and they're like two peas in a pod...it almost seems in hindsight blindingly obvious. Like, why were these two not introduced earlier? How did nobody see it? I know she had a string of shitty insecure guys over the years and now she's with Bear (nickname) and she seems so happy. I couldn't be happier for them both."" — u/peanutbutteroverload ""So one day I showed him a clip of a henati whwre the dudes dick was four times the size of his body and said, 'I wish your dick looked like that.' Suddenly, it wasn't so funny when it happened to him."" — u/Anxious_Light_1808 ""He had a deathgrip reliance (i.e. was overly reliant on getting off via a tight grip while  masturbating, which can lead to desensitization and difficulty achieving orgasm during partnered sex), was only able to get aroused by porn-style techniques (which often don't work in real life), and was unable to enjoy real interaction and intimacy 'because it's not like in the videos.' He was disappointed partners don't do simulated porn noises and don't orgasm when you're actually not doing anything that would cause one. He was a selfish lover and disinterested in the fun/pleasure of his partner, and kept porn as a daily must. Add in the phenomenon of immediately stopping what is being done upon being told that 'this is great, keep doing it...the mind boggles. The experience was so jarring that, in the end, no sex and being alone were preferable to extremely bad sex. A partner should not feel like a sex therapist. This is not every person, but it certainly is some people. I am sure there are many sweet long-term singles out there, too."" — u/Fettnaepfchen ""He was doing his PhD at Stanford in topology — chromatic homotopy theory — and his thing had stuff to do with the Brown-Peterson spectra.

I was totally cool, calm, and collected until the moment when she showed interest in me, and then all of a sudden, the stakes were sky high. I felt hyperaware that at any moment I could do or say something wrong, that interest would vanish, and then I'd be alone again, probably for another few years. Which became a self-fulfilling prophecy when I started acting all insecure and anxious, saying she was out of my league, and trying to rush her into commitment so I could finally relax."" — u/MikeArrow — u/littlefishyswimmy — u/CrickinFunt_RN ""For those who want to know, Peyronie's disease is like if a penis had a hunchback (based on about four seconds of searching)."" — u/in-site — u/rangernddare — u/_oh_for_fox_sake_ ""Yep. He was in his late 20s and had never gone on a date before. He basically got obsessed, was absolutely convinced I was his first and only true love, and wouldn't let it go! Luckily, he never tried to break the order or anything, and I now live a LOOOOONG way away and am happily married!"" — u/_oh_for_fox_sake_ — u/ragredditing ""Lollll did we date the same person? Luckily, I didn't get to the relationship stage — mostly because even a few dates in, he was already using the 'but I don't know anything, I've never been with anyone' excuse. That combined with the overwhelming 'woe is me'/'no one wants a nice guy' talk, running over my boundaries, and porn addiction, I just..could not."" — u/firelord_catra — u/GoodnightESinging ""He even tried to use my other female friends in college to talk me into getting back with him (they didn't know he was abusive and were appalled the moment they learned why I refused). After I finally got him out of my life, I promised myself I would no longer go out with a person unless I actually was attracted to them. I rejected other men who showed interest in me after that because I found none of them attractive, even though they were smart, friendly, and well-adjusted for our age. Then I started wondering whether I even actually found any men attractive at all. I didn't even know what my standards for men were; I just knew that no one ever met them and that I just dated people anyway because I wanted to feel normal. Six or so years later, I happened to read up all about compulsory heterosexuality, then realized I was gay all along."" — u/fraasu ""Of course, there are still some obstacles. He's still kinda awkward at times about being a boyfriend. And while he's aware of his and others' feelings, I still kinda have to pry sometimes for him to open up to certain things."" — u/ThrowRAIka — u/Eyfordsucks — u/Old_Yak2325 — u/the_gold_lioness ""He was so insecure that he would have panic attacks and then would leave and give me the silent treatment for days without any information. He would overthink everything and reinterpret as a criticism of him anything — like really, anything — that I would say or do or show. I was walking on shells constantly. He had given up on happiness and several things in life, and wanted me to be okay with it. These things would impact me as well. He was I think depressed and he didn't think he deserved happiness."" — u/bamibi27 — u/Firm-Telephone2570 — u/Dry-Subject-718 ""He trusted me with his heart from the get-go. I didn't have to break down any walls. He didn't have any trauma from past relationships to get through, and we don't have to worry about any unhinged exes on his side either. With this said, he made it clear in the beginning that he has healthy boundaries and expectations. 👏 I think most women appreciate men like that. He has allowed me to grow and blossom in ways I didn't know were possible for me. Every day is a new challenge, but every day we are there as a team to take it on. He is the best!"" — u/Opposite_Mango_924 — u/Different_Engine16 ""With my husband, he had not been in a relationship because of anxiety and shyness, but he had done a lot of work on himself and was confident, kind, mature, and knew what he wanted. He is an excellent communicator and partner, and he is deeply committed to me, himself, and our relationship together. He views disagreements as something we should solve together, and is loving and kind every day. So ultimately, I think that previous inexperience can be a red flag, but it can also just be a fact of someone's history that does not indicate how their future will unfold."" — u/omnombooks — u/GranddadJokes Submissions have been edited for length/clarity.",2025-06-24T16:56:31.627417+00:00

I haven’t taken them off since I received them; they still look brand new. I’ve worn them in the shower, pools, and at the beach and they are still perfect. "" — Allison Kwong Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in three finishes and 14 other styles). Promising review: ""I don’t usually leave reviews, but no joke, the best fitting and most comfortable tank top I’ve ever owned!! The material smooths and snatches you in so well, and as a girl who can never go braless, I was able to do that in this top. Literally just ordered it in three more colors."" — jaden charney Get it from Amazon for $19.16+ (available in sizes XXS–XL and 24 colors) Reviewers agree that if you want it fitted, size down. Promising reviews: ""I saw this girl wearing this exact style of dress with a Skims tag on the back, and honestly, it made me so grateful that I purchased this dress instead. It looks exactly like the Skims version, and I could be biased, but the material of this dress looked better than the Skims one. If you want it to be a little snug, I would definitely recommend sizing down one size from your normal size. So freaking comfortable and made out of thick material."" — Kaitlyn ""This was purchased to add to my summer dresses. I recently bought one in brown and loved it. So I had to get it in this purple /lavender color. Material's just as good and thick, all while being form-fitting and going to my ankles . It's still breathable, and I could move around without worrying about anything coming loose. I love that even though it was a lighter color, you couldn't see what I was wearing underneath. Perfect. I receive compliments all the time in this dress, even from toddlers . They even know a great look when they see it. Haha. 😊"" — Roxi Roxx Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in sizes XXS–XL and eight colors). Promising review: ""Love these sandals. I bought them for a black and beige dress, thinking I'd be limited to only those matching colors. After receiving and trying them on — it looked perfect with jeans too! My feet are not narrow but not wide either. The fit is perfect on my size 8 feet that are usually in sneakers. Dressing up in these sandals will present a [high-end] vibe and be comfortable, too!! I love the look it gives my feet! Dress it up, dress it down, and easy wearing — my go-to sandals now!!"" — Mrs.D Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and in six colors). Promising reviews : ""I have several pair of Rothy’s in a very similar style to these, and they are actually just as comfortable right out of the box as Rothy’s…maybe more so . I also purchased in black. LOVE THEM!!"" — Amazon Customer ""I couldn’t be happier with these flats! As a result of them dropping in price, I purchased four pairs in varying colors to wear with jeans and sweaters. Not only do they look cute, but they are also decently padded and comfortable. I have been buying Vivaia flats for over $100 and these look just as good and are more comfortable to wear ."" — PSK Get it from Amazon for $32.99 (available in women's sizes 6–10 and 14 colors and patterns). Promising review: ""I’m absolutely delighted with this long-sleeve top! The fit is impeccable , making it perfect for layering or wearing on its own. The material is soft and offers just the right amount of stretch . It’s become a staple piece in my wardrobe because of its versatility — it pairs beautifully with high-waisted jeans, skirts, and even office wear for a touch of modernity. After several washes, it maintains its shape and vibrant color . It’s rare to find such a quality top at this price point. This top has exceeded my expectations and has been a fantastic addition to my collection."" — Alaina Yvonne Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in sizes XXS–XXL and in 21 colors). Promising review: ""Most favorite hair clips! These just dress up anything you are wearing, but you don't have to fix your hair. I love the variety of sizes. The pearls are a beautiful shade of white, I get compliments every time I wear these."" — Molly Get a four-pack from Amazon for $6.99 (available in three different assortments). This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. I have been using this lip oil for two months and don't go anywhere without it. It's sooo moisturizing and leaves such a lovely, subtle tint. When my lips are feeling a little dry, I can apply this to add relieving moisture *and* some lively color to my lips. I also love that the brand has various options for different preferences! Promising review: ""I love K-beauty and this is one of my favorite lip oils. It makes my lips softer and looking like cherry plump. Plus, this shade acts as a lip tint, and I like how long it stays on my lips. As first, I thought that the bottle seems small but after applying 2-3 times/day for a month I still have a lot left to use. It moisturizes your lips and leaves a red tint on your lips, and it's lasted very long!"" — Nhu Get it from Amazon for $9.50 (available in 11 colors, two sizes, and in sets). Promising review: ""I have Fenty Cherry Treat, a lip oil from Dior, and several other brands that were $20 or more…and the Nyx Fat Oil is better! Same consistency as the others, but a little more color, which is a good thing. About as long-lasting as any other thick lip gloss. It’s always awesome to find a less expensive [option] for the high-end products I like."" — Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $8.65 (available in 14 shades). Promising reviews: ""Love these so so much. I wanted the chic Bottega Veneta designer pair, but these look exactly like those for less than $20. Deal of the century. They are comfortable and extremely well made and I seriously can’t get over the price. I’m thinking about buying another color because I love them so much."" — Kam ""Literal wow. These are incredibly nice glasses — not cheap at all and very well made. The material is thick and of obvious quality. Buying these for gifts is awesome."" — Sarah Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in 14 lens colors). Promising reviews : ""My fave Skims [alternative]. I love this brand; their bodysuits are so soft and buttery, and they wash well. You can pair easily with jeans, sweatpants, or joggers — super cute!"" — RK ""Love this bodysuit; it's so soft and fits great. It's very similar to the Lululemon bodysuit that sells for $90. What a steal!"" — Katy B Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 10 colors). Promising review: ""I can confidently say this bodysuit has been a game-changer in my wardrobe. This bodysuit combines comfort, support, and a seamless design to create remarkable shapewear. The versatility of this bodysuit is noteworthy. Whether I'm dressing up for a special occasion or looking for extra support in my everyday attire, this bodysuit seamlessly fits into my wardrobe. It's become a go-to choice for achieving a polished and refined look without sacrificing comfort."" — Hannah Get it from Amazon for $38.99 (available in sizes XXL—5XL and in 11 colors). Promising review : ""I used traditional powder blushes daily up until purchasing this product. My skin is super dry and I didn't know I could have such a natural blush look until Cloud Paint! It really is easy to blend and builds up in color without much effort. The packaging is beautiful and is the perfect size to take anywhere with you. Please never stop making this blush!!!"" — :~) Get it from Glossier for $22 (available in 15 shades). Check out BuzzFeed's full review of Glossier's Cloud Paint for more deets!

I also got the coral, and it is beautiful."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $7.29+ (available in sizes S–3X and 36 colors) Promising review : ""I'm so excited about this belt for the price. It's good quality for the price, fits well, and has a designer look without really looking like a tacky knockoff. I give five stars!"" — kalyjo Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XL and 10 colors). Promising review: ""I have the kind of eyebrows that look very full with brushing, but can quickly look like one has 'collapsed' once my hair or something else touches it. I’ve used nearly every product from Anastasia Beverly Hills, but never had luck keeping my brows in place. Well, let me tell you, this stuff is no joke. I had to scrub my eyebrows clean tonight to get them to move. If you need some help holding your fluff, this will be your new favorite product. Also, I was able to ditch the eyebrow pencil since this stuff holds every hair in the place you brush it ."" — Bailey M, Deacon Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in a one- or two-piece set). Promising review: ""I have always stayed away from foundation because I could never get the color right, it was thick, felt gross on my skin, then would look too heavy. THIS IS AMAZING! I will forever purchase this. It’s light, smooth, and matches my skin. It doesn’t cake into my fine lines and makes my skin look perfect. It’s creamy and soft and moisturizes my skin without it feeling sticky."" — Ot Get it from Glossier for $28 (available in 12 shades). Wear it alone or as a base for your makeup! Check out this TikTok to see how it looks being applied! Promising review: ""I’m obsessed with this product. I have fair skin but I use the deep shade anyway and it makes me look like I have a glowing tan. I get compliments every time I wear it. It is sparkly but subtle. If you don’t have time for a full face of makeup, this really pulls it together with just this one product — the sparkle adds a highlight effect and the tone warms up my complexion . Of course you can wear it as part of full makeup too. I will never go without this product again! Please make it forever!"" — Elana Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I am a licensed cosmetologist of 30+ years and I couldn’t be more pleased! Salon-perfect, shiny, bouncy blow outs! Dries and styles in one or two easy passes ( on damp hair) and provides maximum lift if I style it that way. Easily dries and styles large sections of hair making this THE BEST hairstyling tool! Highly recommend! I use the low setting and cool blast. Surprised and very happy that I don't need med/high settings. Only caveat I have come across so far: the temp/speed setting is in an awkward place to be able to change it while using. Learning curve, I suppose. Otherwise, another GREAT styling tool from Revlon! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"" — ERJ Get it from Amazon for $29.49 . To use, just gather your hair and twist it into a tight bun (no hair tie needed!), tuck in the ends, and spin the pins into the edges of your bun. Promising review: ""When even a ponytail won't do and a hat isn't socially acceptable, pull out the spin pins. These are easy to carry in your purse for emergency hair days . They twist together/around each other so they stay kind of bundled together, and I keep them with several regular bobby pins to keep stray hairs tucked together. I find the minis are far more comfortable to wear as well as easier to get in the hair. You will still need a few pins to secure some random loose hairs if a PERFECT bun is your goal. But if you are like me and most days you just need your hair out of your face and off your neck-these are excellent since the bun stays put . Works beautifully under scrub caps as well."" — Blondiechick Get a three-pack from Amazon for $5.71 (also available as a two-pack). Promising reviews: ""Soooo pretty, it's 100% a Swarovski lookalike for so cheap. Looks exactly like the photo and I wear it every day."" — Trysten Walters ""I LOVE this bracelet!!! It looks so expensive and is heavy duty. If you want a tennis bracelet without spending thousands of dollars, I HIGHLY recommend this!"" — Gabby Little Get it from Amazon for $21.95 (available in three lengths and four finishes, as well as in a set of two). Live Tinted is a woman-owned small business founded by entrepreneur Deepica Mutyala that specializes in clean, vegan, cruelty-free beauty products for all skin tones. Check it out on TikTok . Promising reviews : ""I'll admit, I was totally skeptical of these Huesticks. I am 34-years-old, of Sri Lankan descent (medium to deep tan skin) and I've NEVER been good at makeup. I was excited to try these Huesticks, made by and vouched for by a fellow South Asian, but was worried it would look like I was ACTUALLY wearing makeup. I was pleasantly surprised after using Rise under my eyes and around my mouth, blending with a BeautyBlender and then using my same amount of cc cream and powder foundation. You really still can't tell I'm wearing makeup . I even asked my BF if he could see the orange 'glow' under my eyes before I put on the cc cream and he couldn't see it! It really was color correcting!"" — Reviewer Get it from Ulta for $26 (available in four shades). One side is the curved wing stamp, and the other is a regular fine tip liner for defining the rest of the eye. It comes in a pack of two, one for each eye. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty . Promising review: ""I have very minimal makeup skills. I’m a loner, mascara and gloss kinda girl. I’ve been wanting to do a wing for so long, but with my limited makeup application talent and hooded eyes, it just wasn’t happening. This product changed the game. After trying out the placement a few times, I got it down pat. I love how I can get different looked depending on where I place the wing. I’m beyond satisfied. "" — Michelle Hopson Get a set of two from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). Promising review: ""Okay, this is an honest review. I was SUPER skeptical because I've always been a spray dry shampoo girly, and I thought I was going to die on that hill. We've all been there... in a pinch and out of our dry shampoo and resorted to random powders and suffered the consequences and had to end up washing out hair while already running late. I have super fine hair, and it gets oily in the blink of an eye — even six hours post-shower. I tried this product skeptically, but I am impressed! Literally three dabs and my hair is happy, shiny, and volumized as if I just used a blow dryer! No drowning myself in a Batiste cloud! I'm adding this to my routine forever. "" — Chloe Plummer Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in six shades). This cream helps define your natural texture and works best on those with wavy, curly, or coily hair!! Promising review: ""I hardly ever write reviews for products, let alone add a photo of the results, but my gosh this product is AMAZING. The was just after my first use and I got immediate, satisfying results! Normally, I’d have to take a wand or curling iron to get this effect, but literally all I had to do with this product was take a shower and scrunch it into my hair, and just let it air dry. Not only did my natural waves come out, but my hair feels so soft and looks healthy. This product is also very cost effective! Highly recommend!"" — Carmina Get it from Amazon for $8.47 (also available as a two-pack). Promising review: ""I am in love with this fluffy oversized soft sweater! It's like wearing a cozy hug all day long. The material is incredibly soft, and the oversized fit adds an extra level of comfort. It's perfect for chilly days, keeping me warm without sacrificing style. If you want to feel both comfy and chic, this sweater is a must-have for your wardrobe! "" — Ashley Rowell Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in sizes XS—XL and in 25 styles). Promising review: ""I was really hesitant about buying this but I LOVE it!! I got my regular size and it fit amazing! It is super stretchy and loose so it can cover all areas. I like pulling it up a little bit and having the top area loose. It doesn't slide off the shoulder but if you want it to, it could. I love everything about this item! It is cute, comfy, great fitting, and a staple for my summer! "" — amela Get it from Amazon for $32.29+ (available in sizes S–3XL and 32 colors/patterns). Promising review: ""I don't have very long or thick lashes and I suck with makeup. I was never able to wear false lashes outside the house. Ever. And this was not my first time trying magnetic lashes. But these ones were so, SO easy to put on. The liner is very liquid so it was easy for me to apply and fill in. I used the last set from the natural lashes side for the look in the pics."" — Mona Get an eight-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available as a 10-piece set). Promising review: ""This is a beautiful sweater. It's not too hot, but thick enough that it feels expensive. I wore it to a few work meetings with black pants, and it is very classy and put-together looking. It is a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but it is worth it. I bought the black and tan — very chic! "" — Beaulilie24 Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in sizes S—XL and in 10 colors). Promising review: ""Exactly what I wanted and needed! Keeps my hair out of my face and in so many colors that will go with anything. Doesn’t slide off and not too tight."" — Jojo96 Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 15 color varieties).
