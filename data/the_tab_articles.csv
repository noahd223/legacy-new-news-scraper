For now, Mounjaro is being offered to adults with a BMI over 40, which is classified as severely obese. On top of that, Professor Kamila Hawthorne, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, explained that you need to have at least four other serious health issues linked to obesity. This means if you’re overweight but don’t have these health complications, you probably won’t qualify for the jab on the NHS just yet.

Previously, treatments like this were only available through specialist weight loss clinics. Now, GPs can prescribe Mounjaro directly, which is a big step forward in making it more accessible. But it’s not as simple as just asking your doctor for it. GPs will need to assess whether you meet the criteria and whether this treatment is right for you. Professor Hawthorne also highlighted the challenges GPs face with this new role: “While we recognise the potential benefits of weight loss drugs, we know many GPs are concerned about the implications of the rollout of weight loss drugs into general practice, both in terms of workload and training to appropriately initiate and manage these treatments.” The plan is to roll out the drug gradually over the next few years, reaching around 220,000 people across England who have the highest need. Well, it’s worth knowing that about 1.5 million people in the UK are already taking some form of weight loss medication, whether prescribed through specialist services or privately. For now, if you don’t meet the strict NHS criteria, private prescription might be your only option. But it can be costly. Olivier Picard, chairman of the National Pharmacy Association, pointed out: “The demand for weight loss jabs continues to rise sharply, and more GPs have been directing patients back to pharmacies after initial inquiries, to access these treatments privately.” Experts also warn that these injections aren’t a magic fix. Pharmacists agree that medication should be just one part of a full weight management plan. Olivier Picard added: “The biggest concern we have is that prescribing these medications alone misses the point. They should be part of a comprehensive weight management strategy, combining lifestyle coaching, exercise, and nutritional guidance.” Without that support, there’s a risk people might lose weight with the jab but then gain it back once they stop the medication.

In videos, at least two passengers can be seen leaping from the balloon in mid-air. Among the eight dead were four who couldn’t manage to jump out. When the weight of the balloon went down as people did jump, they got caught in the basket as it started rising again. The other four did jump, but died afterwards. Zevir Cipriano, a military firefighter, said: “These people ended up dying – four charred and another four jumped out of the balloon when it was falling.” It was reported three of those who died inside the balloon died “whilst hugging each other”. via Santa Catarina Fire Department HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock Jorginho Mello, Governor of the Santa Catarina state, said in a statement on Twitter: “We are all shocked by the accident.

This aims to make it harder for universities to penalise students and staff for expressions other than unlawful speech or harassment. These expressions can include critiquing university policies and calling out harassment. This is the first of its kind to explicitly declare how universities in the UK should deal with inflammatory disputes. The Office for Students, which issued the guidance, is a government agency acting as an independent regulator of higher education in England. The guidance comes following an increase instudent protests related to the conflict in Gaza. It also links to the recent backlash against academics with gender-critical opinions such asformer University of Sussex professor Kathleen Stock. The guidance advises universities not to apply prolonged bans on protest encampments involving the Israel-Gaza conflict. It also requires unis to block “frequent, vociferous and intrusive” protests if they intimidate Jewish students. Birmingham students join national walkout in pro-Palestine protest Specifically, the guidance states that institutions must take reasonably practicable steps to secure lawful speech. Thesestepsinclude: The guidance also expects staff and students to use social media legally in a personal capacity, without regard to any impact on institutional reputation. Students can also use social media to chastise any staff members whose speech or activities interferes with their teaching. In addition, the guidance advises universities to refuse places to international students whose funding requires them to follow foreign government policies. This will potentially threaten state-sponsored students from several Asian and Middle Eastern countries. The OfS say its guidelines are to support universities in navigating their duties under the Higher Education (Freedom of Speech) Act. This act will pass on 1st August. However, some experts have criticised the guidance for not addressing the complexity of balancing free speech with the existence of activities with “chilling effects” on students and staff. Julian Sladdin, a specialist in higher education regulation, says the guidance provides “much-needed clarity” for providers but leaves others unclear. He continued in aninterviewwith The Guardian: “The difficulty which remains in practical terms is the fact that institutions are still subject to dealing day-to-day with extremely complex and often polarising issues on campus and where the bounds of what may be lawful free speech are constantly being tested. These matters do not appear to be sufficiently addressed by the guidance at present.” Professor Bobby Duffy, the director of the Policy Institute at King’s College London, has also made a statement on the guidance. He said: “The reality is it’s really tough to have completely clear regulations and laws in this space, which means that the testing of thresholds will be key in particular cases. “We need to recognise that this is not a neutral space but is linked to more general ‘culture war’ divisions in society as a whole – which means that people will be motivated to use regulatory and legal routes to make a point – the process itself can be used to divide. There’s no way around that but we do need to be aware of it.” A spokesperson for Universities UK also added: “We strongly agree that universities must be places where free speech is protected and promoted. These guidelines cover complex issues, and we are pleased to see that the OfS has taken onboard some of the feedback from the previous version. We will continue to work constructively with the OfS and with government as these changes are introduced, and will make sure universities are appropriately supported to comply with them.” Red paint splattered over Senate House by the group Palestine Action in Cambridge The OfS also published a survey of academics about their opinions on the current state of free speech in universities. According to thesurvey, 21 per cent do not feel free to discuss “challenging” ideas in their teaching. This includes 19 per cent who identify as leftwing and 32 per cent who identify as rightwing. Arif Ahmed, the OfS director for freedom of speech, said: “It’s important to remember that universities can regulate speech where appropriate. “No university needs to allow shouting during an exam, or for a math’s lecturer to devote their lectures to their own political opinions rather than the subject at hand. “Equally, they can and should take steps to address harassing speech on campus. Antisemitic harassment, for example, should not be tolerated on any campus and we fully expect universities to take robust steps to tackle it.” BBC Radio 4 also questioned Arif Ahmed about how students from marginalised groups will be protected in the wake of these guidelines. He responded: “It is minorities, and it is those who are often oppressed the most who benefit the most from an atmosphere of freedom of speech in general, because when you are at the weakest point in society, it’s words [that are] perhaps the only thing you can have. And the freedom to organise and speak out is essentially what in the long run will protect minorities.” Overall, it is unclear how individual students will react to the new regulations, but it is expected that these changes will have a significant impact on how they are able to express themselves.

This aims to make it harder for universities to penalise students and staff for expressions other than unlawful speech or harassment. These expressions can include critiquing university policies and calling out harassment. This is the first of its kind to explicitly declare how universities in the UK should deal with inflammatory disputes. The Office for Students, which issued the guidance, is a government agency acting as an independent regulator of higher education in England. The guidance comes following an increase instudent protests related to the conflict in Gaza. It also links to the recent backlash against academics with gender-critical opinions such asformer University of Sussex professor Kathleen Stock. The guidance advises universities not to apply prolonged bans on protest encampments involving the Israel-Gaza conflict. It also requires unis to block “frequent, vociferous and intrusive” protests if they intimidate Jewish students. Birmingham students join national walkout in pro-Palestine protest Specifically, the guidance states that institutions must take reasonably practicable steps to secure lawful speech. Thesestepsinclude: The guidance also expects staff and students to use social media legally in a personal capacity, without regard to any impact on institutional reputation. Students can also use social media to chastise any staff members whose speech or activities interferes with their teaching. In addition, the guidance advises universities to refuse places to international students whose funding requires them to follow foreign government policies. This will potentially threaten state-sponsored students from several Asian and Middle Eastern countries.

There’s a lot of chat from the fans and from fellow Drag Race alumni about how Ginger Minj and her success in this bracket is ‘favouritism’ from production to ensure she does well on the show – and it’s all been kicking off. Ginger Minj has dealt with an onslaught of backlash from those who thinks Denali deserved to win over her, and even Denali has addressed it all. But now, onDrag RaceReddit, there are more rumours circulating regarding how the reaction of Denali after losing the lip sync to Ginger Minj was way more intense and it got cut from the episode – including the fact she stormed off stage and got a telling off from RuPaul. The Reddit is filled with clues, some still in the past episode, so here’s a rundown of the drama.  The first shot that raised eyebrows is one of two that can be spotted right at the end of the latest episode of Drag Race All Stars 10, and feeds into the rumour that Denali stormed off after losing the lip sync to Ginger. When the queens are doing their usual dance off after Ru does the iconic “If you can’t love yourself, how the hell you gonna love someone else” and the queens all dance, Denali can be seen exiting.  In this second shot from a similar part of the episode, after Ru asks “can I get an amen”, the rest of the queens are seen enthusiastically obliging except Denali who looks like she isn’t joining in. The rumours are now saying that Denali was so furious (which she has admitted she felt there was favouritism to Ginger in the wake of this latest episode) that she refused to film more confessionals. This has been echoed by Willam on the Race Chaser podcast, and people think the reason those images went viral ofDenali doing confessionals with longer hairare because she had to come back in and film more at a later date. There were spoilers circulating onRedditby Drag Race leakers pre season that suggested Denali threw a tantrum and stormed off and ended up reprimanded by RuPaul. The Reddit chat discusses how the leakers have been right about everything else to this point, but if it did happen it may have been cut. However, in the preview for the next episode we do see Denali and Ginger Minj have some conflict where it looks like she might have been critical about Ginger’s performance. So the whole Denali stormed off saga may get addresses in the next Drag Race episode, and people think that might even include RuPaul telling Denali off for “being a bad sport”. Juicy!

The programme is famous for its top tier drag queens who compete against each other for money, notoriety, and of course, the crown. The show has also been a gateway for its contestants to appear on other reality shows, and in some cases, start their own or move into other entertainment avenues. This has led to a number of the queens to accumulate incredible wealth, so let’s see which ones have the biggest net worths. A post shared by Violet Chachki (@violetchachki)  Violet Chachki won the seventh season ofRuPaul’s Drag Racein 2015 and has a net worth of $2.5m dollars.

The film follows a 12-year-old boy named Spike as he leaves his safe island home to face the infected chaos of the mainland. Along the way, he meets some unusual characters, but it’s the final scene that really stands out, where we meet the character Jimmy. I am still not over that wild final scene. And now, the film’s creators have revealed there was an alternate ending to 28 Years Later that would have changed everything. At the end of the film, Spike meets Jimmy, played by Jack O’Connell. Jimmy appears out of nowhere with his strange gang, and it’s clear that he is dangerous.The director, Danny Boyle, revealed who Jimmy actually was. He said they wanted to show how evil can grow over time, even in a world that is trying to heal. But it almost ended in another way. via Sony Pictures In an interview withScreenRant, Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland said the original plan for 28 Years Later was very different. The initial ending didn’t even have Jimmy in it. “I’ll be honest with you,” Boyle said, “when Jimmy did arrive, I remember thinking that’s the most original bit of screenwriting I’ve seen since Clockwork Orange.” And he’s not wrong.

The film follows a 12-year-old boy named Spike as he leaves his safe island home to face the infected chaos of the mainland. Along the way, he meets some unusual characters, but it’s the final scene that really stands out, where we meet the character Jimmy. I am still not over that wild final scene. And now, the film’s creators have revealed there was an alternate ending to 28 Years Later that would have changed everything. At the end of the film, Spike meets Jimmy, played by Jack O’Connell. Jimmy appears out of nowhere with his strange gang, and it’s clear that he is dangerous.The director, Danny Boyle, revealed who Jimmy actually was. He said they wanted to show how evil can grow over time, even in a world that is trying to heal. But it almost ended in another way. via Sony Pictures In an interview withScreenRant, Danny Boyle and writer Alex Garland said the original plan for 28 Years Later was very different. The initial ending didn’t even have Jimmy in it. “I’ll be honest with you,” Boyle said, “when Jimmy did arrive, I remember thinking that’s the most original bit of screenwriting I’ve seen since Clockwork Orange.” And he’s not wrong. Jimmy’s arrival gave the film a dark, weird new energy that took things in a whole different direction.

Frominappropriate wedding outfitsto the bigno-no of wearing white, everyone and their grandmother thinks they are the epitome of proper class and elegance. Freelance writer Sydni learned this for herself earlier this week when she uploaded a video from her sister’s wedding.

Not to mention, how much people villainise moms — I can’t imagine that this video would have received the same hateful reaction if a dad posted it,” she wrote. Setting the scene, Sydni explained how it was a small function with only family and close friends in attendance. Her kids, ages seven, six, and three, were the only tots there, and they acted as ring bearers and flower boys for the nuptials. She continued: “I debated whether or not to write this explanation. After all, it’s none of anyone’s damn business! But in the end, I wanted to say something because kids have a right to exist, to have fun, and to express themselves in public.

Kids just do that kind of thing, and you can’t get mad every time they act like, well, kids.” The only opinion that really matters is that of the two brides, both of whom were reportedly pleased with the interruption. But let’s be frank, would they really have replied, “Nah, get those kids out of here” AFTER the dance? Adding further context to her thoughts, Sydni noted how “Birth rates in the U.S. have been down for several years”, and anti-abortion laws are stricter than ever. For those reasons, she won’t apologise for bringing her kids in public. “If you can’t even control yourself from posting rude, mom-shaming comments on a stranger’s Instagram, then how do you expect me to stop a kid from being a kid?

I have a simple solution for everyone who doesn’t want to see kids in public: don’t go in public. And go ahead and log off Instagram while you’re at it,” she added. For more,like The Tab on Facebook.

She provides them with an escape from their gruelling lives. *Eye-roll* Speaking on theDisruptors podcast, the 26-year-old said: “I’m not like every other woman. They get to come to me and I’ll listen to them.” “They’re not asking for an emotional connection and a lot of them sometimes just feel lonely because the world lets them down in loads of ways. They’re made to work, they’re made to provide, they’re made to look after the kids, still empty the dishes. They’re made to do so much and they feel lonely,” she added. “They can’t go and say to their wife ‘You know what, work was hard today’. She’ll bite back and say ‘Oh the kids kept me up, this happened and they dropped their yoghurt on the floor’.” Wow, their lives really aren’t that hard.

Following her savage ban from OnlyFans earlier this month, Bonnie has been desperately bouncing from one divisive moment to the next. She waschatting to randos on the internet, beefing with thespouses of her sexual exploits, and – of course – planning her big comeback event that is practically guaranteed to ignite the internet in fierce opposition. Naturally, in a bid to keep her name in the spotlight,Bonnie teased her interviewwith Andrew Tate last week. The manosphere influencer, who is currently facing charges of rape, actual bodily harm and human trafficking, was an obvious sparring partner for the OnlyFans model who feeds off of controversy. Both appeared on Rob Moore’s Disruptors, a podcast which platforms “the most disruptive individuals on the planet”, over the weekend, with the title detailing how the interaction got “wild.” The interview itself is nearly three hours of ego-inflating sparring, with bothBonnie Blueand Andrew Tate using the time to reaffirm their own positions on womanhood, sex work, and what a real man is. Andrew has always claimed that the peak goal of feminism isOnlyFans, so this interview pretty much just confirmed what he was already peddling. According to the timestamps, the following subjects were broached in the interview between Bonnie Blue and Andrew Tate: If you manage to drag yourself through the two and a half hours of utter nonsense, you’ll proboably find yourself rooting for Bonnie Blue – which I know is a strange feeling consideringher many, many controversies. Amidst the comments from proud incels, very thirsty men, and Bonnie’s usual detractors, most people were genuinly shocked that the world has come to Bonnie Blue versus Andrew Tate. “We got Andrew Tate and Bonnie Blue doing a podcast in the middle of WW3 before GTA 6,” one person wrote. “I haven’t laughed this much in a while! It’s like your last two brain cells having a conversation,” another said. Someone else wrote: “This is low-key some of the most brilliant societal commentary and analysis in the history of humanity.” People also dubbed Bonnie the “final boss of feminism”, which honestly says more about the internet than it does about Bon Bon.

It’s known for being comfy, practical, and big on loungewear and basics. If you want an affordable hoodie or a no-frills knit for the winter, it’ll do the job. But if you’re after something trendy orTikTokworthy, Nutmeg hasn’t quite entered the group chat. That said, it’s making slow progress. The prices are low, and some pieces are of good quality for the cost, it’s just not quite fashion forward yet. It’s giving practical, throw on and go energy – and that’s exactly what Nutmeg delivers. Best for: Basic comfort and kidswear. come with me to sainsbury’s TU – Tu giving spring summer! @TuClothing  🛍️🍋🌞🍉#foryoupage#fyp#comeshoppingwithme#springsummerfashion#tuclothing ♬ summer on the inside – warner case & Jean Tonique & Max Kaluza  Tu is like the friend who’s always effortlessly put together, never flashy, but always on point. The range is consistently solid, you’ll find floaty blouses, stylish trousers, and quality pyjamas that could pass for double the price elsewhere. Tu’s real strength is its classic, timeless vibe. It might not serve runway looks, but it delivers outfits that make sense for everyday life. The quality tends to be good, and the sizing is fairly inclusive too. The downside? It’s less adventurous, and depending on your local Sainsbury’s, the in store selection can be hit or miss. Best for: Polished basics and workwear. M&S try on… (I’m size 8 5ft for reference)  Links where I can in my bio  @Marks & Spencer#tryon#newness#highstreetfashion#marksandspencer ♬ original sound – rutlandgirlfashionstyle  Okay, M&S isn’t technically a supermarket fashion label, it’s a whole high street brand. But since so many people shop there for food and fashion, we’re counting it. And let’s just say, M&S has had its fashion glow up. From must-have cosy cardigans to statement tops making waves on social media, Marks & Spencer has gone from mumsy to modern. Prices are a bit higher than your average supermarket line, but the quality reflects that. It’s classic without being boring and occasionally throws out a showstopper that sells out instantly. Best for: Quality staples with a size of unexpected style. Get yourselves to @Asda @George At Asda girls 😻🙌#ComproDoPequeno#outfitinspo#summeroutfit#curvyfashion#curves#outfit#fyp ♬ Hip Hop Background(814204) – Pavel  George is quietly killing the game. It’s affordable, stylish, and actually fun. Whether you’re after bold prints or easy basics, George delivers – and the size range (six to twenty four) is a big win. The brand leans hard into current trends and its social media presence has grown thanks to influencers showing off their supermarket hauls. Some pieces are more trend driven than timeless, but that’s part of the appeal for anyone after a seasonal refresh. Best for: Trendy everyday wear and size inclusivity. what do we think?! i’m really surprised at how gorgeous everything was, i love the neutral linen trousers so much!#fandf#fandfclothing#tescoclothing#tryonhaul ♬ Carlos Compos Param Pam Pam – reeltemplates.pro   And the winner is…Tesco. Yep, F&F is officially that girl. Think clean lines, breathable fabrics, and flattering fits. And now that F&F is finally online (after years of only being in store), it’s gone from underrated to unstoppable. The label mixes affordable prices with trendy pieces that will last. From loungewear to formal dresses, Tesco delivers fashion finds you’d never expect to spot between the bread and milk. F&F also gets points for size inclusivity and a growing presence on socials. Add in the fact that you can grab a killer outfit while doing your weekly shop and suddenly fashion never looked so convenient. Best for: On trend, online, and totally wearable fashion. Supermarket fashion has officially entered its main character era. Whether you’re after affordable dupes, capsule wardrobe classics, or just a cute top that doesn’t break the bank, great style really can be found next to your weekly shop. So next time someone asks where your outfit is from, don’t be afraid to say “Tesco, actually”.

And let’s be real, there’s something pretty satisfying about picking up a new, fresh fit alongside your meal deal.

Here’s a ranking from basic to best dressed. ♦️NUTMEG by MORRISONS ♦️NEW WOMENS SUMMER CLOTHING COLLECTION AVAILABLE IN STORES 😍DETAILED VIDEO HAS BEEN UPLOADED ON YOUTUBE CHANNEL ⬇️#morrison#morrisons#morrisonsstore#morrisonsuk#nutmeg#nutmeghaul#newcollection#newfinds#new#newspringcollection#haul#haulvideo#springcollection#spring#spring2025#haul#summer#summerfashion#summerfashionhaul#summertrends#latestfashiontrends#newsummercollection#womensfashion#findandshopwithana#fashiontrends#haulvideo#dresses#tops#outerwear#womensouterwear#trouser#nightwear#slippers#knittedsweater#springcollection#may2025#2025#springcollectionhaul#tops#trouser#springcollection ♬ Natural Emotions – Muspace Lofi  Let’s be honest, Nutmeg is still in its soft launch era when it comes to fashion. It’s known for being comfy, practical, and big on loungewear and basics. If you want an affordable hoodie or a no-frills knit for the winter, it’ll do the job. But if you’re after something trendy orTikTokworthy, Nutmeg hasn’t quite entered the group chat. That said, it’s making slow progress. The prices are low, and some pieces are of good quality for the cost, it’s just not quite fashion forward yet. It’s giving practical, throw on and go energy – and that’s exactly what Nutmeg delivers. Best for: Basic comfort and kidswear. come with me to sainsbury’s TU – Tu giving spring summer! @TuClothing  🛍️🍋🌞🍉#foryoupage#fyp#comeshoppingwithme#springsummerfashion#tuclothing ♬ summer on the inside – warner case & Jean Tonique & Max Kaluza  Tu is like the friend who’s always effortlessly put together, never flashy, but always on point. The range is consistently solid, you’ll find floaty blouses, stylish trousers, and quality pyjamas that could pass for double the price elsewhere. Tu’s real strength is its classic, timeless vibe. It might not serve runway looks, but it delivers outfits that make sense for everyday life. The quality tends to be good, and the sizing is fairly inclusive too. The downside? It’s less adventurous, and depending on your local Sainsbury’s, the in store selection can be hit or miss. Best for: Polished basics and workwear. M&S try on… (I’m size 8 5ft for reference)  Links where I can in my bio  @Marks & Spencer#tryon#newness#highstreetfashion#marksandspencer ♬ original sound – rutlandgirlfashionstyle  Okay, M&S isn’t technically a supermarket fashion label, it’s a whole high street brand. But since so many people shop there for food and fashion, we’re counting it. And let’s just say, M&S has had its fashion glow up. From must-have cosy cardigans to statement tops making waves on social media, Marks & Spencer has gone from mumsy to modern. Prices are a bit higher than your average supermarket line, but the quality reflects that. It’s classic without being boring and occasionally throws out a showstopper that sells out instantly. Best for: Quality staples with a size of unexpected style. Get yourselves to @Asda @George At Asda girls 😻🙌#ComproDoPequeno#outfitinspo#summeroutfit#curvyfashion#curves#outfit#fyp ♬ Hip Hop Background(814204) – Pavel  George is quietly killing the game. It’s affordable, stylish, and actually fun. Whether you’re after bold prints or easy basics, George delivers – and the size range (six to twenty four) is a big win. The brand leans hard into current trends and its social media presence has grown thanks to influencers showing off their supermarket hauls. Some pieces are more trend driven than timeless, but that’s part of the appeal for anyone after a seasonal refresh. Best for: Trendy everyday wear and size inclusivity. what do we think?! i’m really surprised at how gorgeous everything was, i love the neutral linen trousers so much!#fandf#fandfclothing#tescoclothing#tryonhaul ♬ Carlos Compos Param Pam Pam – reeltemplates.pro   And the winner is…Tesco. Yep, F&F is officially that girl. Think clean lines, breathable fabrics, and flattering fits. And now that F&F is finally online (after years of only being in store), it’s gone from underrated to unstoppable. The label mixes affordable prices with trendy pieces that will last. From loungewear to formal dresses, Tesco delivers fashion finds you’d never expect to spot between the bread and milk. F&F also gets points for size inclusivity and a growing presence on socials. Add in the fact that you can grab a killer outfit while doing your weekly shop and suddenly fashion never looked so convenient. Best for: On trend, online, and totally wearable fashion. Supermarket fashion has officially entered its main character era. Whether you’re after affordable dupes, capsule wardrobe classics, or just a cute top that doesn’t break the bank, great style really can be found next to your weekly shop. So next time someone asks where your outfit is from, don’t be afraid to say “Tesco, actually”.

If you’re hoping to head to uni in London this September, first of all, congratulations on securing an offer! You’ve undoubtedly heard vague bits of advice about how London student life is completely different to student life in the rest of the country. It’s true – it’s an experience like no other, and it could be the best time of your life if you can learn to adapt to it. To help with that, here’s everything you need to know about what makes studying in London so unique.  Most of us have a certain image of student life- getting plastered with your friends and having a crazy, spontaneous night out before trekking back to your halls in the early hours of the morning, then rolling out of bed and dragging yourself to lectures in yesterday’s makeup and whatever old hoodie you could find on the floor. Although this is definitely the way of life for many London students, it’s nowhere near as common as it seems to be at other unis. Spontaneity is almost impossible – go out without pre-booked tickets and you’ll get charged £20 or more on the door at most clubs. There’s wild nights out and shameful hangovers, but there’s also weekend brunches, theatre visits and pottery classes. It’s all part of the big city appeal, but it can sometimes feel like you’ve skipped forward to your thirties. No one will judge you if you prefer to live your life a bit more on the messy side, but you might have to overcome a bit of internal conflict. Don’t let the Instagram Stories of truffle pasta and fancy cocktails shame you out of your Pot Noodles and vodka-squash. It’s all about balance.  If you’re used to being surrounded by nature, you will almost definitely be thrown off by London’s lack of it. Before the Christmas lights go up, London’s autumn and winter scenery is depressingly grey, with constant noise pollution and a distinct lack of fresh air. Try to avoid running home for your nature fix – making a habit of leaving London can make it difficult to sustain uni friendships – and instead head for one of London’s massive parks. If you walk to the middle of Regent’s Park or Hampstead Heath, it can be easy to forget that you’re in the city at all. The sound of traffic is far enough away to be ignored, and there’s more wildlife than just pigeons and rats, making for a welcome escape from the hustle-and-bustle of the capital. Another favoured spot to get a fix of greenery is Primrose Hill. As soon as the sun comes out, London students flock there to take in its iconic skyline while having picnics and day-drinking. You might have heard of the stereotype of the gilet-wearing LSE finance bro, or the antisocial Imperial nerd, but London’s other universities all have their own stereotypes too. UCL students are known for being globetrotting LinkedIn addicts who can’t stop bragging about being ranked ninth best in the world. King’s has a reputation for having one-sided rivalries with pretty much every other uni in London. UAL students are known for their you-can’t-sit-with-us demeanour, which, to be fair, is well earned. They’re definitely cooler than the rest of us. Of course, these stereotypes are all sweeping generalisations, but there’s no denying that some of them are a little bit true. An Imperial student in a club is a rare find, and UCL students’ Instagram Stories are constantly filled with mysteriously-funded holidays abroad. If you’re heading to a London uni this September, why not try to break your stereotype? We’d all be grateful for an influx of LSE students who don’t try to explain the stock market at the club, or UAL students who smile when they talk to you.  If you’re not from the capital, your typical night out probably has three stages- a brief pre-drinks, a few hours in the pub or a bar-crawl, and a night-ending boogie at a local club. If stage two is your favourite part of the night, prepare to be disappointed- it barely exists in London. Since drink prices at London pubs and bars are through the roof – we’re talking £7 pints and £10 shots – spending hours drinking at a pub just isn’t financially viable for most students. Prices tend to be more reasonable at students’ union bars, but good luck getting your drink in less than half an hour once the clock hits 9pm. Even the otherwise trusty Spoons menu is inflated- their famous two pitchers deal is as low as £12.50 elsewhere, against a whopping £20 at most London locals. Losing the pubs and bars stage of the night means that almost all drinking is done at pres. It can be strange at first, but it’s something you get used to. The pres become big events of their own, and it helps that the clubs are probably miles better than whatever small town Popworld or Revs you’re used to.  If you can adapt to the lack of pub culture, one of the biggest perks of moving to theworld’s best student cityis that, unlike other unis, you won’t be limited to Wednesday sports nights for a decent night out. Going out on weekdays can be a great way to save some money, especially if you have a couple of days in your timetable when lectures start a bit later. On Mondays, head to Heaven for £1 entry and £3.50 drinks deals. Tuesdays are for Ministry of Sound’s Milkshake nights, and UCL’s Scala sports night is the place to be on a Wednesday. From Thursday onwards, pretty much everymajor clubin the city will be packed. Make the most of those student nights in your first year. While plenty of people still go to them in second and third year, many ditch their freshers’ favourites for cooler spots like Corsica Studios, Dalston Superstore and KOKO. They have their perks, but you don’t want to miss out on the cheesy fun of Ministry Tuesdays and sports nights – it’s an essential part of the London student experience.  Nightlife in London isn’t one-size-fits-all. You’ll have a very different experience depending on which area of the city you choose to go out in. Camden is known as the centre of London’s alternative scene, while Dalston and Stoke Newington take the edgy, hipster cool-kid crown. Soho is the place to be for LGBT+ spots, and Shoreditch is known for its trendy rooftops and wine bars. Then there’s the beast known as Mayfair clubbing. At celeb-frequented clubs like Cirque le Soir, Maddox and The London Reign, girls can drink for free all night – as long as you can find a promoter, wear a dress and heels, and ignore the gawking, blazer-clad businessmen paying upwards of £50 to get in. It’s not for everyone, but it can be fun to drink for free there before heading into the more laid-back clubs in neighbouring Soho. For whatever reason, more students at London universitiesget firststhan anywhere else in the country, by a significant margin. The national average is around 30 per cent, but at Imperial, UCL and LSE, 54.4 per cent, 49.8 per cent and 44 per cent of students are awarded a first – the first, second and fifth highest percentages in the country. This might seem like a benefit, but the high rate of top grades isn’t because the marking is more generous – it’s because London students go insane over exam season. Everyone turns into a hermit for two months. Social plans become a distant memory. Marks of 70+ seem to be viewed as the standard, rather than as something exceptional. It does get a bit less intense as you get further into your degree and everyone starts to get humbled by second and final year content, but it can be very intimidating in first year. Just remember that it’s not the national standard, and if you don’t graduate with a first, you’ll still be in the majority. Cs get degrees, and London students get some of the best career opportunities in the country.  Students at any of the University of London’s 17memberinstitutions can benefit from shared UoL resources on top of the resources provided by their own uni. If your campus library is full, head over to Senate House. All UoL students can access the massive library there, complete with sofas and a café. There’s also a centralised UoL careers service, a range of societies open to UoL students from any university, and a very useful housing service for when the time comes to find your second year accommodation (which, by the way, will be much later in the year than your friends at other unis). Did you think internships were just an American thing? Turns out they’re not. We have them here too, and for many London students, securing one is more important than getting top grades or having a social life. Internships are basically just a few months of paid work experience. They’re great to have on your CV, but they can be very difficult to get into. Unless you want to be an investment banker or a consultant, don’t panic if you don’t manage to get one. Internship culture is much more prominent at London universities than others, probably because most major companies’ internships are based in London. Applications for competitive, well-paid internships in sectors like finance and consulting tend to open first, while internships in fields like marketing, government and creative industries open later on.Bright Networkis a great tool for keeping track of openings and deadlines.

Since drink prices at London pubs and bars are through the roof – we’re talking £7 pints and £10 shots – spending hours drinking at a pub just isn’t financially viable for most students. Prices tend to be more reasonable at students’ union bars, but good luck getting your drink in less than half an hour once the clock hits 9pm. Even the otherwise trusty Spoons menu is inflated- their famous two pitchers deal is as low as £12.50 elsewhere, against a whopping £20 at most London locals. Losing the pubs and bars stage of the night means that almost all drinking is done at pres. It can be strange at first, but it’s something you get used to. The pres become big events of their own, and it helps that the clubs are probably miles better than whatever small town Popworld or Revs you’re used to.  If you can adapt to the lack of pub culture, one of the biggest perks of moving to theworld’s best student cityis that, unlike other unis, you won’t be limited to Wednesday sports nights for a decent night out. Going out on weekdays can be a great way to save some money, especially if you have a couple of days in your timetable when lectures start a bit later. On Mondays, head to Heaven for £1 entry and £3.50 drinks deals. Tuesdays are for Ministry of Sound’s Milkshake nights, and UCL’s Scala sports night is the place to be on a Wednesday. From Thursday onwards, pretty much everymajor clubin the city will be packed. Make the most of those student nights in your first year. While plenty of people still go to them in second and third year, many ditch their freshers’ favourites for cooler spots like Corsica Studios, Dalston Superstore and KOKO. They have their perks, but you don’t want to miss out on the cheesy fun of Ministry Tuesdays and sports nights – it’s an essential part of the London student experience.  Nightlife in London isn’t one-size-fits-all. You’ll have a very different experience depending on which area of the city you choose to go out in. Camden is known as the centre of London’s alternative scene, while Dalston and Stoke Newington take the edgy, hipster cool-kid crown. Soho is the place to be for LGBT+ spots, and Shoreditch is known for its trendy rooftops and wine bars. Then there’s the beast known as Mayfair clubbing. At celeb-frequented clubs like Cirque le Soir, Maddox and The London Reign, girls can drink for free all night – as long as you can find a promoter, wear a dress and heels, and ignore the gawking, blazer-clad businessmen paying upwards of £50 to get in. It’s not for everyone, but it can be fun to drink for free there before heading into the more laid-back clubs in neighbouring Soho. For whatever reason, more students at London universitiesget firststhan anywhere else in the country, by a significant margin. The national average is around 30 per cent, but at Imperial, UCL and LSE, 54.4 per cent, 49.8 per cent and 44 per cent of students are awarded a first – the first, second and fifth highest percentages in the country. This might seem like a benefit, but the high rate of top grades isn’t because the marking is more generous – it’s because London students go insane over exam season. Everyone turns into a hermit for two months. Social plans become a distant memory. Marks of 70+ seem to be viewed as the standard, rather than as something exceptional. It does get a bit less intense as you get further into your degree and everyone starts to get humbled by second and final year content, but it can be very intimidating in first year. Just remember that it’s not the national standard, and if you don’t graduate with a first, you’ll still be in the majority. Cs get degrees, and London students get some of the best career opportunities in the country.  Students at any of the University of London’s 17memberinstitutions can benefit from shared UoL resources on top of the resources provided by their own uni. If your campus library is full, head over to Senate House. All UoL students can access the massive library there, complete with sofas and a café. There’s also a centralised UoL careers service, a range of societies open to UoL students from any university, and a very useful housing service for when the time comes to find your second year accommodation (which, by the way, will be much later in the year than your friends at other unis). Did you think internships were just an American thing? Turns out they’re not. We have them here too, and for many London students, securing one is more important than getting top grades or having a social life. Internships are basically just a few months of paid work experience. They’re great to have on your CV, but they can be very difficult to get into. Unless you want to be an investment banker or a consultant, don’t panic if you don’t manage to get one. Internship culture is much more prominent at London universities than others, probably because most major companies’ internships are based in London. Applications for competitive, well-paid internships in sectors like finance and consulting tend to open first, while internships in fields like marketing, government and creative industries open later on.Bright Networkis a great tool for keeping track of openings and deadlines.

It only took half of 2025. Here are 15 ways you can identify a posh girl during a summer heat wave. If you spot her doing these things, run now. Or try to secure an invite to her next boujie house party. During a heat wave, nothing resuscitates your soul quite like an iced beverage But iced matchas are just not financially sustainable choices. I mean, it’s like six quid for a tiny plastic container of fluorescent fluid, most of which is just ice. God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers. Other common complaints are, “the croquet lawn is too dry” and “who will water the alpine house while we’re in Mykonos?” No, they’re not posting Instagram stories from a luxury Mediterranean villa. That’s just Tilly’s back garden. Now, people have common sense understand most of the stuff in student houses will get nicked by pesky flatmates and/or vomited on. People who have too much money will buy a whole new array of overpriced decorations and unnecessary kitchen equipment at the start of each year. Honestly, Tatiana, one stray VK and that fluffy white rug is doomed. Other acceptable pastimes include watching the polo and playing croquet non-ironically. Does anyone really understand the rules of this silly game? Only girls with more money than personality will be seeingall the pop girlies on tour this summer. Nothing screams “I have more time and money than I have sense” quite like a picnic. Why spend money on foldable chairs and floral plastic plates and woven hampers? Why waste hours packing up snacks you could’ve just eaten at home? I guarantee nobody will touch the kimchi samosas after they’ve sat in the sun for two hours, and have been licked by a pack of labradors.  Next time, don’t bother spending a fortune on crudités in M&S.

As soon as the chauffeur arrives to pick up a posh girl’s parents for their ninth holiday to Santorini that week, the posh girl will invite everyone round. Well, she can’t be expected to drink the whole wine cellar by herself. Normal students go to Reading or Leeds festival with a cheap tent some drunk guy has p*ssed on three years in a row. Posh students will rock up to Glasto with the same caravan they take to showjumping events. Wow, I wonder how Petronella Bridgerton-Windsor managed to get work experience at a consultancy firm called Bridgerton-Windsor Tax Advisors. The ticket price doesn’t factor in how much money they were peer-pressured into wasting on ballgowns Wait, that girl didn’t go to Oxford or Cambridge? How has she wangled her way into Trinity College May Ball for the fourth year in a row? And how can she affordall these £250+ tickets? Spending two weeks on a yacht at Lake Como tends to do that to your complexion. Ordering cocktails at pubs? In this economy? This has got to be the most impractical clothing item known to womankind. One stray droplet of red wine, and they’re gone. Wearing white linen trousers isn’t just a fashion statement. It’s a signal that you can afford to keep buying new clothes. You wonder why you haven’t seen Araminta for a couple of weeks. Then you consult Snap Maps, and realise she’s been sunbathing at her grandfather’s villa in southern France since April.
