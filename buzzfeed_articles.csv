Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Just a few fashion and beauty items that'll help you look effortlessly put together at all your summer outings. BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: ""I love the way these layering necklaces look! I haven’t taken them off since I received them; they still look brand new. I’ve worn them in the shower, pools, and at the beach and they are still perfect. "" — Allison Kwong Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in three finishes and 14 other styles). Promising review: ""I don’t usually leave reviews, but no joke, the best fitting and most comfortable tank top I’ve ever owned!! The material smooths and snatches you in so well, and as a girl who can never go braless, I was able to do that in this top. Literally just ordered it in three more colors."" — jaden charney Get it from Amazon for $19.16+ (available in sizes XXS–XL and 24 colors) Reviewers agree that if you want it fitted, size down. Promising reviews: ""I saw this girl wearing this exact style of dress with a Skims tag on the back, and honestly, it made me so grateful that I purchased this dress instead. It looks exactly like the Skims version, and I could be biased, but the material of this dress looked better than the Skims one. If you want it to be a little snug, I would definitely recommend sizing down one size from your normal size. So freaking comfortable and made out of thick material."" — Kaitlyn ""This was purchased to add to my summer dresses. I recently bought one in brown and loved it. So I had to get it in this purple /lavender color. Material's just as good and thick, all while being form-fitting and going to my ankles . It's still breathable, and I could move around without worrying about anything coming loose. I love that even though it was a lighter color, you couldn't see what I was wearing underneath. Perfect. I receive compliments all the time in this dress, even from toddlers . They even know a great look when they see it. Haha. 😊"" — Roxi Roxx Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in sizes XXS–XL and eight colors). Promising review: ""Love these sandals. I bought them for a black and beige dress, thinking I'd be limited to only those matching colors. After receiving and trying them on — it looked perfect with jeans too! My feet are not narrow but not wide either. The fit is perfect on my size 8 feet that are usually in sneakers. Dressing up in these sandals will present a [high-end] vibe and be comfortable, too!! I love the look it gives my feet! Dress it up, dress it down, and easy wearing — my go-to sandals now!!"" — Mrs.D Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and in six colors). Promising reviews : ""I have several pair of Rothy’s in a very similar style to these, and they are actually just as comfortable right out of the box as Rothy’s…maybe more so . I also purchased in black. LOVE THEM!!"" — Amazon Customer ""I couldn’t be happier with these flats! As a result of them dropping in price, I purchased four pairs in varying colors to wear with jeans and sweaters. Not only do they look cute, but they are also decently padded and comfortable. I have been buying Vivaia flats for over $100 and these look just as good and are more comfortable to wear ."" — PSK Get it from Amazon for $32.99 (available in women's sizes 6–10 and 14 colors and patterns). Promising review: ""I’m absolutely delighted with this long-sleeve top! The fit is impeccable , making it perfect for layering or wearing on its own. The material is soft and offers just the right amount of stretch . It’s become a staple piece in my wardrobe because of its versatility — it pairs beautifully with high-waisted jeans, skirts, and even office wear for a touch of modernity. After several washes, it maintains its shape and vibrant color . It’s rare to find such a quality top at this price point. This top has exceeded my expectations and has been a fantastic addition to my collection."" — Alaina Yvonne Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in sizes XXS–XXL and in 21 colors). Promising review: ""Most favorite hair clips! These just dress up anything you are wearing, but you don't have to fix your hair. I love the variety of sizes. The pearls are a beautiful shade of white, I get compliments every time I wear these."" — Molly Get a four-pack from Amazon for $6.99 (available in three different assortments). This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. I have been using this lip oil for two months and don't go anywhere without it. It's sooo moisturizing and leaves such a lovely, subtle tint. When my lips are feeling a little dry, I can apply this to add relieving moisture *and* some lively color to my lips. I also love that the brand has various options for different preferences! Promising review: ""I love K-beauty and this is one of my favorite lip oils. It makes my lips softer and looking like cherry plump. Plus, this shade acts as a lip tint, and I like how long it stays on my lips. As first, I thought that the bottle seems small but after applying 2-3 times/day for a month I still have a lot left to use. It moisturizes your lips and leaves a red tint on your lips, and it's lasted very long!"" — Nhu Get it from Amazon for $9.50 (available in 11 colors, two sizes, and in sets). Promising review: ""I have Fenty Cherry Treat, a lip oil from Dior, and several other brands that were $20 or more…and the Nyx Fat Oil is better! Same consistency as the others, but a little more color, which is a good thing. About as long-lasting as any other thick lip gloss. It’s always awesome to find a less expensive [option] for the high-end products I like."" — Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $8.65 (available in 14 shades). Promising reviews: ""Love these so so much. I wanted the chic Bottega Veneta designer pair, but these look exactly like those for less than $20. Deal of the century. They are comfortable and extremely well made and I seriously can’t get over the price. I’m thinking about buying another color because I love them so much."" — Kam ""Literal wow. These are incredibly nice glasses — not cheap at all and very well made. The material is thick and of obvious quality. Buying these for gifts is awesome."" — Sarah Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in 14 lens colors). Promising reviews : ""My fave Skims [alternative]. I love this brand; their bodysuits are so soft and buttery, and they wash well. You can pair easily with jeans, sweatpants, or joggers — super cute!"" — RK ""Love this bodysuit; it's so soft and fits great. It's very similar to the Lululemon bodysuit that sells for $90. What a steal!"" — Katy B Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 10 colors). Promising review: ""I can confidently say this bodysuit has been a game-changer in my wardrobe. This bodysuit combines comfort, support, and a seamless design to create remarkable shapewear. The versatility of this bodysuit is noteworthy. Whether I'm dressing up for a special occasion or looking for extra support in my everyday attire, this bodysuit seamlessly fits into my wardrobe. It's become a go-to choice for achieving a polished and refined look without sacrificing comfort."" — Hannah Get it from Amazon for $38.99 (available in sizes XXL—5XL and in 11 colors). Promising review : ""I used traditional powder blushes daily up until purchasing this product. My skin is super dry and I didn't know I could have such a natural blush look until Cloud Paint! It really is easy to blend and builds up in color without much effort. The packaging is beautiful and is the perfect size to take anywhere with you. Please never stop making this blush!!!"" — :~) Get it from Glossier for $22 (available in 15 shades). Check out BuzzFeed's full review of Glossier's Cloud Paint for more deets! Promising review: "" I love these — they are so soft and comfy. The white is not see-through at all. I also got the coral, and it is beautiful."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $7.29+ (available in sizes S–3X and 36 colors) Promising review : ""I'm so excited about this belt for the price. It's good quality for the price, fits well, and has a designer look without really looking like a tacky knockoff. I give five stars!"" — kalyjo Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XL and 10 colors). Promising review: ""I have the kind of eyebrows that look very full with brushing, but can quickly look like one has 'collapsed' once my hair or something else touches it. I’ve used nearly every product from Anastasia Beverly Hills, but never had luck keeping my brows in place. Well, let me tell you, this stuff is no joke. I had to scrub my eyebrows clean tonight to get them to move. If you need some help holding your fluff, this will be your new favorite product. Also, I was able to ditch the eyebrow pencil since this stuff holds every hair in the place you brush it ."" — Bailey M, Deacon Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in a one- or two-piece set). Promising review: ""I have always stayed away from foundation because I could never get the color right, it was thick, felt gross on my skin, then would look too heavy. THIS IS AMAZING! I will forever purchase this. It’s light, smooth, and matches my skin. It doesn’t cake into my fine lines and makes my skin look perfect. It’s creamy and soft and moisturizes my skin without it feeling sticky."" — Ot Get it from Glossier for $28 (available in 12 shades). Wear it alone or as a base for your makeup! Check out this TikTok to see how it looks being applied! Promising review: ""I’m obsessed with this product. I have fair skin but I use the deep shade anyway and it makes me look like I have a glowing tan. I get compliments every time I wear it. It is sparkly but subtle. If you don’t have time for a full face of makeup, this really pulls it together with just this one product — the sparkle adds a highlight effect and the tone warms up my complexion . Of course you can wear it as part of full makeup too. I will never go without this product again! Please make it forever!"" — Elana Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I am a licensed cosmetologist of 30+ years and I couldn’t be more pleased! Salon-perfect, shiny, bouncy blow outs! Dries and styles in one or two easy passes ( on damp hair) and provides maximum lift if I style it that way. Easily dries and styles large sections of hair making this THE BEST hairstyling tool! Highly recommend! I use the low setting and cool blast. Surprised and very happy that I don't need med/high settings. Only caveat I have come across so far: the temp/speed setting is in an awkward place to be able to change it while using. Learning curve, I suppose. Otherwise, another GREAT styling tool from Revlon! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"" — ERJ Get it from Amazon for $29.49 . To use, just gather your hair and twist it into a tight bun (no hair tie needed!), tuck in the ends, and spin the pins into the edges of your bun. Promising review: ""When even a ponytail won't do and a hat isn't socially acceptable, pull out the spin pins. These are easy to carry in your purse for emergency hair days . They twist together/around each other so they stay kind of bundled together, and I keep them with several regular bobby pins to keep stray hairs tucked together. I find the minis are far more comfortable to wear as well as easier to get in the hair. You will still need a few pins to secure some random loose hairs if a PERFECT bun is your goal. But if you are like me and most days you just need your hair out of your face and off your neck-these are excellent since the bun stays put . Works beautifully under scrub caps as well."" — Blondiechick Get a three-pack from Amazon for $5.71 (also available as a two-pack). Promising reviews: ""Soooo pretty, it's 100% a Swarovski lookalike for so cheap. Looks exactly like the photo and I wear it every day."" — Trysten Walters ""I LOVE this bracelet!!! It looks so expensive and is heavy duty. If you want a tennis bracelet without spending thousands of dollars, I HIGHLY recommend this!"" — Gabby Little Get it from Amazon for $21.95 (available in three lengths and four finishes, as well as in a set of two). Live Tinted is a woman-owned small business founded by entrepreneur Deepica Mutyala that specializes in clean, vegan, cruelty-free beauty products for all skin tones. Check it out on TikTok . Promising reviews : ""I'll admit, I was totally skeptical of these Huesticks. I am 34-years-old, of Sri Lankan descent (medium to deep tan skin) and I've NEVER been good at makeup. I was excited to try these Huesticks, made by and vouched for by a fellow South Asian, but was worried it would look like I was ACTUALLY wearing makeup. I was pleasantly surprised after using Rise under my eyes and around my mouth, blending with a BeautyBlender and then using my same amount of cc cream and powder foundation. You really still can't tell I'm wearing makeup . I even asked my BF if he could see the orange 'glow' under my eyes before I put on the cc cream and he couldn't see it! It really was color correcting!"" — Reviewer Get it from Ulta for $26 (available in four shades). One side is the curved wing stamp, and the other is a regular fine tip liner for defining the rest of the eye. It comes in a pack of two, one for each eye. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty . Promising review: ""I have very minimal makeup skills. I’m a loner, mascara and gloss kinda girl. I’ve been wanting to do a wing for so long, but with my limited makeup application talent and hooded eyes, it just wasn’t happening. This product changed the game. After trying out the placement a few times, I got it down pat. I love how I can get different looked depending on where I place the wing. I’m beyond satisfied. "" — Michelle Hopson Get a set of two from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). Promising review: ""Okay, this is an honest review. I was SUPER skeptical because I've always been a spray dry shampoo girly, and I thought I was going to die on that hill. We've all been there... in a pinch and out of our dry shampoo and resorted to random powders and suffered the consequences and had to end up washing out hair while already running late. I have super fine hair, and it gets oily in the blink of an eye — even six hours post-shower. I tried this product skeptically, but I am impressed! Literally three dabs and my hair is happy, shiny, and volumized as if I just used a blow dryer! No drowning myself in a Batiste cloud! I'm adding this to my routine forever. "" — Chloe Plummer Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in six shades). This cream helps define your natural texture and works best on those with wavy, curly, or coily hair!! Promising review: ""I hardly ever write reviews for products, let alone add a photo of the results, but my gosh this product is AMAZING. The was just after my first use and I got immediate, satisfying results! Normally, I’d have to take a wand or curling iron to get this effect, but literally all I had to do with this product was take a shower and scrunch it into my hair, and just let it air dry. Not only did my natural waves come out, but my hair feels so soft and looks healthy. This product is also very cost effective! Highly recommend!"" — Carmina Get it from Amazon for $8.47 (also available as a two-pack). Promising review: ""I am in love with this fluffy oversized soft sweater! It's like wearing a cozy hug all day long. The material is incredibly soft, and the oversized fit adds an extra level of comfort. It's perfect for chilly days, keeping me warm without sacrificing style. If you want to feel both comfy and chic, this sweater is a must-have for your wardrobe! "" — Ashley Rowell Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in sizes XS—XL and in 25 styles). Promising review: ""I was really hesitant about buying this but I LOVE it!! I got my regular size and it fit amazing! It is super stretchy and loose so it can cover all areas. I like pulling it up a little bit and having the top area loose. It doesn't slide off the shoulder but if you want it to, it could. I love everything about this item! It is cute, comfy, great fitting, and a staple for my summer! "" — amela Get it from Amazon for $32.29+ (available in sizes S–3XL and 32 colors/patterns). Promising review: ""I don't have very long or thick lashes and I suck with makeup. I was never able to wear false lashes outside the house. Ever. And this was not my first time trying magnetic lashes. But these ones were so, SO easy to put on. The liner is very liquid so it was easy for me to apply and fill in. I used the last set from the natural lashes side for the look in the pics."" — Mona Get an eight-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available as a 10-piece set). Promising review: ""This is a beautiful sweater. It's not too hot, but thick enough that it feels expensive. I wore it to a few work meetings with black pants, and it is very classy and put-together looking. It is a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but it is worth it. I bought the black and tan — very chic! "" — Beaulilie24 Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in sizes S—XL and in 10 colors). Promising review: ""Exactly what I wanted and needed! Keeps my hair out of my face and in so many colors that will go with anything. Doesn’t slide off and not too tight."" — Jojo96 Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 15 color varieties).

Now everyone takes time to put their shoes in this and the area looks so nice. I’ve had many compliments on it."" — Vicki Davis ""I’ve had open shoe racks and the shoes were always falling out. Now all my shoes are contained and organized and hidden in a nice cabinet that’s low profile ."" — Kirsten Soquel Get it from Amazon for $117.99+ (available in two colors).

I am very happy with this purchase!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors).

Good value for the money!""  — Ichi Ban Get it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in five sizes and seven colors). It comes with a removable liner for the hamper that can be easily lifted out and wiped clean with a damp cloth. Promising review: ""Straightforward assembly and a beautiful product, I was really happy. This looks perfect in a small bathroom, and hides the unsightly laundry pile nicely. I keep makeup on top and extra toilet papers in middle, with plenty of space. The bamboo is nice and water resistant too, so deals well with humidity."" — AJohns Get it from Amazon for $76.68 . Promising review: ""This is amazing!!!!! It looks like a different fireplace. I have been looking at a horrible grout repair that the previous owners did for 20 years. I did this in about two hours!!!!!! This product is fast, it's easy to use, easy to clean up, and inexpensive ."" — Denise Get a pint from Amazon for $26.96+ (available in three sizes/styles).

Won’t regret."" — April Olsen Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in two sizes and three colors). No tools required! It comes with a two-way clamping design that works on both horizontal and vertical surfaces. It's compatible with desks that are up to 3.1 inches thick. BedShelfie is a POC-owned small business that focuses on space-saving solutions for the home. Promising review: ""First impression of the CarryUp, the build of it is solid and felt heavy. The weight of it made me confident it will hold up well and last me a long time. Overall setup was a breeze. No tools needed at all. One sentence that sums up this product for me ... Simple and effective!!!!! If you have messy cords underneath your desk then don't think, just buy this product."" — Eddie Sadiwa Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (also available in green). Promising review: ""So easy to put together I could put it together with my eyes closed. It fit amazingly perfectly between the tub and the toilet and it has created so much more space and my bathroom is no longer cluttered because of this product."" — COS45B Get it from Amazon for $25.10 (available in two colors). OK, so painting your concrete patio may not sound like the easiest upgrade but if you're no stranger to painting and want a big impact, give it a try! Promising review: ""Works great. Used it in the basement for a quick, simple, inexpensive upgrade to brighten up the floor a bit and give the cement a clean look. Did a fairly good job filling in some of the hairline cracks as well."" — T Get a gallon from Amazon for $35+ (available in silver gray or slate gray). Promising reviews: ""I absolutely, LOVE this litter box cabinet. I used to keep it in my closet until noticing my clothes would have a chalky film on them. This is perfect! ! Not only does it hide the box itself, but it helps contain any smells that are beginning to emanate from the box. I clean it out every other day and have never noticed any odors. I also took out the divider, because my box was a few inches too long. All changing supplies are kept inside, so it works out great! I HIGHLY recommend, this litter box cabinet!!"" — Angie ""This is the perfect way to conceal a litter box as well as the odors and dust that come with them. I have noticed a significant difference in the air quality in my home, it is as if I don't even have a litter box."" — Annie Get it from Wayfair for $75.99+ (originally $79.99; available in five colors). While restoring a finish isn't quite the same as completely refinishing a piece, it takes much less time and can still make furniture (and floors , front doors , and kitchen cabinets ) look magically new again. Promising review: ""Very easy to get results. I applied to eight dining room chairs which had scrapes, scuffs, and white paint marks. An amazing transformation so quickly. I finished eight chairs in 90 minutes without rushing. I bought two pints but only one was necessary. I used a cotton cloth for most of the application but also used 0000 steel wool for the scrapes and paint removal."" — Grumpy Neanderthal Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in eight wood finish colors; also available in larger sizes ). Many reviewers follow up with the same brand's wood polish and conditioner (they're meant to be used together!), which you can get for $10.47 from Amazon. Former BuzzFeed Shopping editor Abby Kass says: ""I used a similar kit on my TV stand after moving it into my current apartment, and it worked great! It was super easy to use — you just color in the scratch. And you can't tell the difference. It's amazing! And next time I move, I'm def hiring movers."" Promising reviews: ""I can’t believe how well these work! Much better than I was expecting. I just had my home interior painted, and the painters damaged a fiberboard medicine cabinet when they removed the masking tape. It ripped off the fake-wood veneer. These markers completely filled in the ugly spots, and the colors blended well. I love that it appears to have some clear coat in it, too, as it dries with a slight shine that makes it look more like wood stain rather than marker. I also used them to stain wood filler in two spots in my maple kitchen cabinets where a previous homeowner had hung a paper towel holder, and I really struggle to see the hole! It looks fantastic. I highly recommend this set. It’s a good value and works very well."" — Shane ""These are great. I have several finishes on different pieces of furniture, and after several years, they were showing lots of scratches. Not anymore. Super easy to use and covered everything. Wasn't sure after paying such a minimal price that they'd work, but they really do."" — Kindle Customer Get a set of 13 markers from Amazon for $13.99 . You can also line the top of a pergola with these vines for some shade, letting a bit of dappled sunlight pass through for a gorgeous effect! Promising review: ""This was exactly what we needed for the backyard. It definitely provides enough privacy, and it gives the backyard a very nice ambiance! The leaves completely blend in with the other trees and plants we have in the backyard, and it looks like we made a huge upgrade in our gardening game. I'm now just hoping it can withstand the AZ summer and not fade with the sun (product description does state fade resistant). Don't be hesitant with purchasing; it's totally worth it!!"" — Amazon Customer Get a roll from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in three sizes). You'll need some green zip ties to secure them, too. You can use these for so much more than clothing! Think craft supplies, extra toiletries, shoes...basically whatever you have too much of. Promising review: "" These storage bags are fantastic. I live in a small apartment where storage space is at a premium. I use these to store my Costco toilet paper and paper towels so I don't need to make as many trips to the store. It keeps them in pristine condition and out of sight. The handles make them easy to pull in and out, and they fold up nicely when not in use. I'm thinking about getting two more since four will fit under my queen bed."" — Kimberly Dorn Get a two-pack from Amazon for $12.97+ (available in three colors and in packs of four). Promising review: ""Looks great — really ‘finishes’ off the look. Ironed very easily and looks really nice. Material is very soft and holds the pleat."" — AM Get it from Target for $27.99+ (available in seven sizes and 10 colors). Promising review : ""These look great and are super easy to apply. This is the perfect solution for hiding a cord! It looks like it is just a part of the baseboard. Mine is covering a cable wire only, but I think they are big enough to hide more than one cord if needed. I didn’t cut mine, and I bought two. You can tell where the two meet if you look closely. However, I do not think anyone would notice. I can’t believe I let our cable cord sit across the floor for this long. I wish I would have found these sooner! "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in three sizes, five colors, and in multipacks). Promising review: ""I usually don't leave reviews, but I have to with this touchup paint. I had cheap command hooks on my wall to hang up my curtains in my apartment, and they ended up falling off and damaging the wall. I brought this to cover it up since it was an eyesore, and this worked perfectly! Thankfully, I matched the right shade, and you can't even tell. It's easy to use and not messy at all. Once it dries, it instantly blends in. I'm glad it worked so well because now I can put more stuff on my walls and fix it with the paint so it won't affect my security deposit, LOL."" — N.D. Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in three sizes, 26 colors, and in sets of three). Clare is a Black woman-owned business that makes paint shopping easier than ever.

Exactly what I wanted and after shopping around and seeing prices ranging from $1k to $700 the price is unbeatable! Turned my dining room into a room out of a model home! "" — JH ""Wow, I just hung up this ceiling light, and my room’s got a whole new vibe! It’s got a great look, feels sturdy, and the quality’s seriously impressive. It gives off the perfect amount of cozy light, and it’s pretty stylish, too. Super happy with this find!"" — Jon Get it from Amazon for $121.59+ (available in six styles). Promising review: ""Power washer was delivered Monday, it’s Wednesday and I have washed two cars, cleaned driveway and sidewalks, cleaned back fence and the work keeps piling up , everything I see now needs to be cleaned! This little dude does not back down, plenty of power and it's surprisingly not too loud. Soap dispensers work great, and the tips are easy to change."" — MAR Get it from Amazon for $169.15 . Promising review: ""This was recommended to me by a guy who sold us redwood boards from his mill. It went on easily and it looks gorgeous! I stained a fence and two decks in the last three years and this product is far superior right off the bat. Love the richness of the color and the wood is soaking it up consistently."" — I Know Jack Get a 1-gallon can from Amazon for $32.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""This was very easy to install to hide all the messy wires. This is life changing to create a nice, sleek space."" — Martha Ashley Get it from Amazon for $21.95+ (available in four lengths and two configurations).

I use it in my living room to hide remotes, reading glasses, dental floss, etc."" — Free Spirit Get it from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in three sizes and three colors). The adjustable cord measures 5.5 feet. It does not include bulbs, but you can get a set of compatible Edison bulbs here . Promising review: ""Love these green pendants above our island. The color is a perfect muted olive green and the wood accent just elevates the look. For reference our island is 8ft long and three of these lights fit perfectly."" — Jay Stanford Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in four colors). Promising reviews: ""Bought a house with canned lights everywhere. I wanted a few semi-flush, pendants and chandeliers so I tried this product. Very easy to install and works like a charm. "" — PJG123 ""It may take a bit of finessing and maybe an extra hole drilled here or there but it will eventually do what it is supposed to do. I now have a surface- mounted light on my front porch instead of the can light the builder supplied. We turned a dark ugly space into a wonderfully lit beautiful space. We are amazed at the transformation this lighting change made to our home. Would do this again in a second."" — TDC Get it from Amazon for $21.44 . The 35-quart container comes with all the mounting hardware you'll need. Promising review: ""I hesitated to trade existing storage space for a trashcan but I am so glad I did. The Rev-A-Shelf was easy to install and worked exactly as I expected. The instructions were a bit lacking but a quick check on YouTube is all you need. Just four easily placed screws to your cupboard bottom and project complete. The fact that the kitchen trash is not the first thing guests see when they enter my house is awesome. I should have done this upgrade years ago! You won't be sorry if you purchase this unit. I love it!"" — daisy Get it from Amazon for $67.99+ (available in seven colors, or check out other options and sizes for the Rev-A-Shelf trashcan storage ). Promising reviews: ""Boy does this tape pretty up an otherwise and boring toilet. Way better than a bead of caulk. Clean....clean...clean before installation. Also helps to warm the product. Can be stretched during installation to better fit around tight bends. Been in place for a few weeks; still holding fine."" — Selaretus ""Went on easily around the toilet, [it] looks so much better. Covered discoloration around the base, highly recommend."" — Jerry Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in four sizes/styles). Promising review: ""I have a weirdly tall transition to my bathrooms and struggled with getting a normal threshold to stay in the entrance to my other bathroom after laying vinyl tile, so I hesitated on doing the hall bath until I found this product. Problem solved! Looks great and doesn’t budge! And affordable! I will definitely be ordering more for the long gap between my laminate and marble flooring in another area that I have hated for years.""— m. white Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""Changed the oil on my girlfriend's car and some oil spilled on my NEW driveway...which I didn't notice 'til four days later. Four spots all about the size of a dollar bill baking in the Arizona sun for four days. Put the stuff on (sits on the stain like pancake batter — don't be afraid to pour liberally) and let it sit from 6 p.m. 'til about 9 a.m. the next day. It dried and the instructions said to just sweep the stuff up. It broke apart with the broom and the stains were gone, just swept up the powder pieces — took about a minute. I WAS SHOCKED! Something that actually works on oil and it's easy. Absolutely NO sign of anything that was there. My driveway is smooth concrete so I can't vouch for what would happen with a rougher surface but whoever makes this stuff is a genius. If they tried to take on World Peace, Earth would be a better place."" — AmazonBob Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (also available in a larger size). Farmhouse Iron Co. is a small business based at an actual farm on the central coast of California. If you're looking for shabby-chic or rustic home decor, this is the shop for you! Promising review: ""These plates are very beautiful. They match perfectly with the decor of my house. Very happy with this purchase."" — Ingrid Hogan Get it from Farmhouse Iron Co. on Etsy for $13+ (available in five styles). These shelves measure 45"" x 45"" and can hold up to 250 lbs of evenly distributed weight. Promising review: ""These are a great way to open up more storage potential in the garage. This is actually my third home when I've used these in my garage. If you have lots of room between your garage door and your ceiling, these can be used up there to allow you to store stuff in a space you would otherwise not be able to use. They're great for being able to store stuff way up high and not take up any floor space . We store all of our Christmas lights and other holiday decorations on them. They hold up the weight of four or five big bins full of Christmas light strings, no problem."" — Buster Get it from Amazon for $99.99+ (available in two styles). This tapestry measures 18"" x 40"" so make sure it'll be a good fit to cover your electrical panel! Promising review: ""I bought this to cover the electric panel in our mudroom. It covers it perfectly so now it's not the first thing you see when you walk in. Had to brush out the tassels a little bit but it is good quality!"" — J. Underwood Get it from Amazon for $33.99 . Promising review: ""Best looking metal spray paint I have seen. It took me 90 minutes to prepare, mask, and paint my bathroom faucet. I used about 1/2 a can of this paint."" — OC-Adam Get it from Amazon for $9.48 (available in several metallic finish colors). Promising review: ""Super easy to install and took less than 30 min to put together, level out, and hammer in the stakes. My HOA doesn’t allow the trash bins to be visible from the street so this fixed that issue plus it matches my house trim."" — Joseph and Anne Sawyer Get it from Amazon for $160.02 (also available in additional styles/sizes ). This DIY project is easiest if your sink or countertop already has an existing hole for a soap dispenser! This kit includes a stainless steel dispenser pump with a 360-degree swivel, a 47"" no-spill extension tube with check valve, a connecting pipe, and a 17-oz. soap bottle. You can use the extension tube in your own jug of soap (pictured above) OR you can fill the included 17-oz. bottle with your own soap instead. The kit is designed for a universal fit and can accommodate sink holes that measure between 1"" and 1.5"" in diameter. Promising review: ""It's just as described! I bought this in brushed nickel so it would match the sink! Love it! Finally, my guests can wash their hands without knocking a bottle over or shifting its spot on the sink! It can swivel 360° and comes with a longer tube, two rubber plugs to fit different-sized bottles, and an empty plastic bottle. I chose to screw on the plastic bottle directly to the dispenser so it doesn't sit on the bottom but will keep longer tube in case I change my mind later. The bottle holds on very well! The best part is when the soap runs out, I can replenish the bottle by removing the dispenser head from the top of the sink without having to crawl back under again! No tools required! Took about five minutes! Highly recommend!"" — ItsJenAgain91 Get it from Amazon for $24.95+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""I bought these to replace the ugly, plain registers that were on my ceiling. Installed in less than 10 minutes and they look beautiful. I ordered white and spray painted them nickel to match my ceiling fan. Couldn't be happier."" — AsMeow Get one from Amazon for $15.40 . This roll of self-adhesive trim measures 4 inches by 20 feet. Promising review: ""This was very easy to apply and make sure you have it where you want it before sticking because it REALLY sticks to the wall. I laid out the roll and let it relax for a day before cutting and applying. Love the easy-to-clean material. Made trimming out my bathroom/ laundry room quick and easy."" — Cassie Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in 11 sizes and seven colors). Promising review: ""[I] bought this so I could store my gardening items and kids' toys. It has been perfect. It is big enough to fit everything from my planters, gardening tools, kids' water guns, balls, etc. and it still has a lot of space. My kids use it as a bench to sit on as well. Durable and sturdy so far."" — Sid Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in eight sizes and five colors). Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:09:35.664738+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff — u/lamapuchita ""Anyway, I eventually dumped him. Years later, we ran into each other, and by then, I had lost all the weight and had become super fit. He proceeded to tell me he'd been single since we broke up and once again threw a tantrum about my weight, this time all upset that I was now thin and that I wasn't during our relationship. He actually used the word 'unfair.' I told him I had to go home to my husband and walked off."" — u/Slappyxo — u/Sisyfos1234 — u/morbidemadame — u/glamasaurus — u/GhostOfYourLibido ""This is my current situation, ughh. We've been dating for three months, and I just found out he has a 'sex worker addiction' that he is working on. 😭 I was in the hospital recently and generally having health problems, and yesterday, he said he couldn't FaceTime me to watch a movie together because he did too much coke the night before and didn't feel good…but that he'd call me when he felt better (he never did). I think I'm breaking up with him today. He never had a girlfriend before me."" — u/PaleNewspaper3 ""I pursued him ultimately, seeing what a nice guy he was, that he was goofy and intensely curious, and that we had things in common. Plus, I wanted to give him a chance. He was pretty nervous, sweet, and inexperienced in ways, but we talked about it. And BECAUSE we talked about it, and he is such a great big nerd, he would RESEARCH what I was bringing up, holy shit the orgasms were wild. He was dedicated, thoughtful, open to new ideas, and soooo wonderfully nerdy. Yeah, I am married to this dude now."" — u/masterpiecemixtapes ""It wasn't a disaster, but it was exhausting. I learned that it doesn't matter if you've had a thousand partners or none: what matters is your emotional maturity and your willingness to grow."" — u/No-Public6996 — u/Piksu4444 — u/DBones90 — u/Zestyclose_Visit4834 — u/shutupphil — u/coding_hobbit — u/AmyGranite ""When I immediately packed my shit and left he started crying about me being his 'best friend' and how could I abandon him like this? Easily, as it turns out. I haven't talked to him since, and that was about three years ago. So yeah. Didn't go well. Now I focus my energy exclusively on myself. No more helping people become the best version of themselves at my own expense. I hope he's living his best life, but by god, he'd better stay far out of mine."" — u/chronostrats ""He didn't answer WhatsApp, and when I called, he didn't answer the phone. I didn't pressure him; it's absolutely okay if someone needs some time to themselves to think about certain things. But no sign of life for a week...at least for me, that's not possible in a relationship. By the way, he contacted me off and on for months after I broke up. But I didn't feel like going to that kind of theater anymore."" — u/LutschiPutschi — u/Gullible-Ad7011 — u/hellouterus ""It's so sad because he is such a good man. I think he just needed someone to love him and believe in him. It's going really great between us. He has shown that he isn't afraid to change and grow while still being true to himself. If anything, it just makes me admire him more because being capable of change is a huge deal."" — u/SnooBananas8065 ""He suddenly/finally bumped into a girl we know back in the UK. They would never have been a situation where they'd have linked; it just happened by chance when he was picking up some stuff from our friend's house and stayed for food and DnD (I wasn't there)... They've been together now for a year, and they're like two peas in a pod...it almost seems in hindsight blindingly obvious. Like, why were these two not introduced earlier? How did nobody see it? I know she had a string of shitty insecure guys over the years and now she's with Bear (nickname) and she seems so happy. I couldn't be happier for them both."" — u/peanutbutteroverload ""So one day I showed him a clip of a henati whwre the dudes dick was four times the size of his body and said, 'I wish your dick looked like that.' Suddenly, it wasn't so funny when it happened to him."" — u/Anxious_Light_1808 ""He had a deathgrip reliance (i.e. was overly reliant on getting off via a tight grip while  masturbating, which can lead to desensitization and difficulty achieving orgasm during partnered sex), was only able to get aroused by porn-style techniques (which often don't work in real life), and was unable to enjoy real interaction and intimacy 'because it's not like in the videos.' He was disappointed partners don't do simulated porn noises and don't orgasm when you're actually not doing anything that would cause one. He was a selfish lover and disinterested in the fun/pleasure of his partner, and kept porn as a daily must. Add in the phenomenon of immediately stopping what is being done upon being told that 'this is great, keep doing it...the mind boggles. The experience was so jarring that, in the end, no sex and being alone were preferable to extremely bad sex. A partner should not feel like a sex therapist. This is not every person, but it certainly is some people. I am sure there are many sweet long-term singles out there, too."" — u/Fettnaepfchen ""He was doing his PhD at Stanford in topology — chromatic homotopy theory — and his thing had stuff to do with the Brown-Peterson spectra. I was the first girl who bothered to ask, 'What is chromatic homotopy theory?' The rest is history."" — u/sf-keto — u/HipsterWhoMissedOut — u/varthalon ""Yep, that's how it feels when you're in a scarcity mindset. I was totally cool, calm, and collected until the moment when she showed interest in me, and then all of a sudden, the stakes were sky high. I felt hyperaware that at any moment I could do or say something wrong, that interest would vanish, and then I'd be alone again, probably for another few years. Which became a self-fulfilling prophecy when I started acting all insecure and anxious, saying she was out of my league, and trying to rush her into commitment so I could finally relax."" — u/MikeArrow — u/littlefishyswimmy — u/CrickinFunt_RN ""For those who want to know, Peyronie's disease is like if a penis had a hunchback (based on about four seconds of searching)."" — u/in-site — u/rangernddare — u/_oh_for_fox_sake_ ""Yep. He was in his late 20s and had never gone on a date before. He basically got obsessed, was absolutely convinced I was his first and only true love, and wouldn't let it go! Luckily, he never tried to break the order or anything, and I now live a LOOOOONG way away and am happily married!"" — u/_oh_for_fox_sake_ — u/ragredditing ""Lollll did we date the same person? Luckily, I didn't get to the relationship stage — mostly because even a few dates in, he was already using the 'but I don't know anything, I've never been with anyone' excuse. That combined with the overwhelming 'woe is me'/'no one wants a nice guy' talk, running over my boundaries, and porn addiction, I just..could not."" — u/firelord_catra — u/GoodnightESinging ""He even tried to use my other female friends in college to talk me into getting back with him (they didn't know he was abusive and were appalled the moment they learned why I refused). After I finally got him out of my life, I promised myself I would no longer go out with a person unless I actually was attracted to them. I rejected other men who showed interest in me after that because I found none of them attractive, even though they were smart, friendly, and well-adjusted for our age. Then I started wondering whether I even actually found any men attractive at all. I didn't even know what my standards for men were; I just knew that no one ever met them and that I just dated people anyway because I wanted to feel normal. Six or so years later, I happened to read up all about compulsory heterosexuality, then realized I was gay all along."" — u/fraasu ""Of course, there are still some obstacles. He's still kinda awkward at times about being a boyfriend. And while he's aware of his and others' feelings, I still kinda have to pry sometimes for him to open up to certain things."" — u/ThrowRAIka — u/Eyfordsucks — u/Old_Yak2325 — u/the_gold_lioness ""He was so insecure that he would have panic attacks and then would leave and give me the silent treatment for days without any information. He would overthink everything and reinterpret as a criticism of him anything — like really, anything — that I would say or do or show. I was walking on shells constantly. He had given up on happiness and several things in life, and wanted me to be okay with it. These things would impact me as well. He was I think depressed and he didn't think he deserved happiness."" — u/bamibi27 — u/Firm-Telephone2570 — u/Dry-Subject-718 ""He trusted me with his heart from the get-go. I didn't have to break down any walls. He didn't have any trauma from past relationships to get through, and we don't have to worry about any unhinged exes on his side either. With this said, he made it clear in the beginning that he has healthy boundaries and expectations. 👏 I think most women appreciate men like that. He has allowed me to grow and blossom in ways I didn't know were possible for me. Every day is a new challenge, but every day we are there as a team to take it on. He is the best!"" — u/Opposite_Mango_924 — u/Different_Engine16 ""With my husband, he had not been in a relationship because of anxiety and shyness, but he had done a lot of work on himself and was confident, kind, mature, and knew what he wanted. He is an excellent communicator and partner, and he is deeply committed to me, himself, and our relationship together. He views disagreements as something we should solve together, and is loving and kind every day. So ultimately, I think that previous inexperience can be a red flag, but it can also just be a fact of someone's history that does not indicate how their future will unfold."" — u/omnombooks — u/GranddadJokes Submissions have been edited for length/clarity.",2025-06-24T17:09:35.860209+00:00

To manage your preferences for personalized ads from Google , Facebook or Amazon , please visit their preference centers This is a short explanation of how we at BuzzFeed use our own cookies and similar targeting technologies on our sites and in our apps. Note: this only explains what we do, not what our third party advertising partners do. If you’re in the UK or EU, you can find out who they are and see their privacy notices under “Partners” in our consent management platform.  What are “first party” cookies  We collect data from users of our websites and apps by placing a small piece of code known as a “first-party cookie” on your device when you access the website or app. First-party cookies collect data only for BuzzFeed; if an advertiser or other company wants to access this data, they must go to BuzzFeed and get permission.  You can also delete them at any time via your browser settings (usually under “clearing cached cookies” or a similar setting).  We do not use cookies that cannot be deleted via browser settings.  How does it work?  The cookie stores a unique identifier consisting of a randomized sequence of numbers and/or letters, known as the “cookie ID.”  This “cookie ID” does not contain a user’s name, email address or other contact details, age, gender, or other personal characteristics. When you interact with a BuzzFeed website or app, the website or app reads the cookie ID from the cookie stored on your device and then records your interactions with the website or the app, such as which pages you visited, whether you clicked on anything on the page (links, ads, etc.), and how long you spent on the page.  These interactions are associated with the cookie ID.  What does Buzzfeed do with this data?  We use this data for two purposes.  Firstly, we use it to analyse our users’ behaviour to help us understand how people like to use our sites and apps, what works, when demand peaks and we might need to make more bandwidth available, and so on.  This is platform maintenance and development work.  Secondly, we use it to target ads.  We explain a bit more about that below.  Data gathering for platform maintenance and development and for ad targeting use completely separate cookies, and we store the data gathered from them separately. Data gathered for development purposes is not used for ad targeting, and vice versa.  How do you target ads?  The first-party cookie used for ad-targeting does not transmit the user interaction history to BuzzFeed; it only stores this history on the user’s device and BuzzFeed cannot view the history. The cookie ID itself is transmitted to and stored by BuzzFeed servers.  When a targeted ad is served on a BuzzFeed website or app, the webpage where the ad is will read the first-party cookie on the user’s device.  The webpage sends the first-party cookie the ad-targeting parameters, which the cookie then compares to the interaction history stored on the user’s device.  If there is a match, the targeted ad is served.  If there is not a match, the targeted ad is not served.  Do other people give you data to target ads?  Sometimes one of the brands that advertises with us will ask us to target their ads to people who have visited their site, or to a subset of those people. One way to do that is for them to pass to us their own first party cookie data, so that we can recognise you as someone who has visited their site and that they want to target.  In those cases, that data is kept separate from our own data and is only used for that advertiser.  We never are allowed to directly access see the first-party cookie data provided by the brand.  The technology provider we use for our first party cookies also gives us the ability to make use of larger so-called “audience” data sets from reputable providers like Nielsen as a kind of overlay or additional filter on our own data.  However, we never actually see that underlying data.  Do you collect anything sensitive?  BuzzFeed does not collect and use information about people’s personal characteristics such as race/ethnicity, gender, age, or sexual orientation in order to target ads.  Ad-targeting is based on a user’s interests in specific content, as guessed from their interaction history.  So, for example, if a user often interacts with content categorized by BuzzFeed as related to African-American culture and interests, the user is more likely to see ads targeted to African-American culture and interests.

This color scheme screams '90s! It was always a true vibe being in a Taco Bell during this time period. Isn't it just so inviting and cozy to look at? '90s Taco Bell just oozes serotonin. Shopping malls in the '90s were THE place to be every weekend! Be there or be square. What better place to be than the mall with the kooky geometric shapes, bright colors, and greasy food? Most of all, who can forget all the questionable '90s fashion choices? Let's just say, lots of denim and glitter! McDonald's was a magical wonderland in the '90s. Food aside, they had the BEST playground. I have so many memories of being a menace as a kid and playing on that playground for hours. Let's not mention how germ-infested those things were, mmkay? These McDonald's usually had statues of Ronald McDonald or Grimace that were so iconic. We were total besties back then. Walmart was such a great place for shopping in the '90s. Now, the gaming section? That was my JAM. They had all your gaming needs (even if you'd nearly break your neck looking up at the screen trying to play a game demo). If you know, you know! One of the best weekend activities (besides the shopping mall) was to go rent movies at Blockbuster and have a movie night! Ah, a time before streaming services. There were also snacks, candies, and even movie/TV merch. To this day, I still have some figurines my parents bought me from Blockbuster that I have displayed (they must be considered relics now, right?). In the '90s, everywhere was a fun hangout spot. Pizza Hut hit just right when you needed a good pizza to fill you up! One of the best things to play around with while eating was the jukebox and arcade games. And who could forget the iconic red cups? What better way to spend your time at the mall than getting your glamour shot with your besties or family? These were typically awkward, yet fun. The backgrounds usually had a wild design and/or a blur effect. These glamour shots can get real awkward real quick. If you guys were anything like me, one of your favorite things was to go out and buy any type of teen magazine, rip out any and all posters, and COVER your wall with your teen crush (which changed often, so you had many posters). Probably complete with a bean bag chair and beaded curtains. You just had to be there. This may seem farfetched, but hear me out — there was something so calming (and liminal) about the school library. A computer?! In the library?! So futuristic! And who can forget one of the best events the library would have... those famous Scholastic Book Fairs just hit different back then. One of the best and most nostalgic school memories. Toys R' Us was THE place to get anything you could imagine as a kid. You could literally shop there for hours, finding games and toys that were just so top tier you HAD to get them. It was a different experience from just going to any store. Though I'm not going to lie — Geoffrey the Giraffe was a little unsettling to look at sometimes, but he means well. If you weren't renting movies from Blockbuster, then you were going out to the movie theater to watch the latest hit. Movie theaters in the '90s were something of their time. Colorful, bold, bright, and neon. I mean, just look at that lineup. It can't get any more '90s than that.",2025-06-24T17:14:53.124304+00:00

Danielle also explained that she made the decision to go public with her diagnosis in a bid to encourage others to get checked out, especially as the only reason the cancer was caught so early was because she didn’t put off her annual mammogram appointment.  Opening today’s episode of the podcast, Danielle said that her cohosts and decades-long friends, Will Friedle and Rider Strong, were two of the first people that she had shared the news with. DCIS affects the cells of the milk ducts in the breast, with Cancer Research writing: “It means that some cells in the lining of the ducts of the breast tissue have started to turn into cancer cells. These cells are all contained inside the ducts. They have not started to spread into the surrounding breast tissue.”  If left untreated, DCIS can develop into invasive breast cancer, which means that the cancer cells have broken out of the ducts and spread into the tissue. At this point, the cells can also spread into a person’s lymph nodes and other parts of the body.  Danielle explained: “I was diagnosed with high-grade DCIS with micro-invasion, and I’m going to be fine. I’m having surgery to remove it; I’m going to be on some follow-up treatment. I’ve had to make a lot of decisions over the last couple of days.” But author Glennon Doyle inspired Danielle, with the star explaining: “[Glennon] often talks about how a lot of people like to save sharing their experiences until they've come out on the other side of it, so that they're able to say: ‘Here's the pretty picture of it all, here's what I've learned,’ the end of the story. But the place you have the most to learn from is at the very beginning of a story, or in the very messy middle of a story.”  “My first instinct when I was diagnosed was to do that clam-up thing,” she confessed. “Then what I realized is, the more people I talk to, the more people had their own experiences, either themselves being diagnosed with cancer or a family member who's been diagnosed with cancer, and the world of resources and experiences that can be shared by sharing it, and things that can be learned.” “Instead, I was like: ‘Yeah, it’s time, gotta make that appointment,’ and they found it so, so, so early that I’m going to be fine,” she added. “So I want to share this because I hope that it will encourage anyone to get in there if it's time for your appointment, if you've never had an appointment before, get in there.”  “If you have to find out that you have cancer, find out when it's at stage zero if possible,” Danielle reiterated. “I have some big decisions ahead of me about what I want to do for treatment, I don't have all the answers yet; I still have doctors I need to meet with, oncologists, radiation specialists, hormone therapists, all kinds of stuff that I have still in front of me to decide.”  Danielle also explained that while she is “going to try” and not let her treatment impact the podcast, there may be times when things have to be postponed, or that she is absent from episodes. Meanwhile, Rider revealed that he and his wife have four friends who are currently battling breast cancer as he also highlighted the importance of getting checked out.  Will added: “And for men, too, prostate exams and colonoscopies, these are all things that are super important so don’t put them off.” BuzzFeed Staff",2025-06-24T17:14:53.768913+00:00

We made it 50 weeks. She called me from her boyfriend's house while I was visiting her parents (had her 6-year-old with me) to tell me she had spent the night with him. I rented a truck, got my dad and some friends together, drove to our place, and emptied it to the bare walls."" — kellydean1 "" It took the death of someone very close to me for me to open my eyes and see our relationship for what it was. I asked for space, and he [became very abusive.] I had completely mentally checked out by this point and just wanted him to leave me alone. It took him to be arrested for assault twice and a restraining order for him to get the message and to finally leave me in peace. Suddenly, I wasn't being controlled anymore. Never settle for someone so selfish and unwilling to work with you."" — sherlockwench ""The real kicker was that looking back, I don't think I was ever actually in love with her. According to my family/friends, I always try to 'fix the broken people' without regard for my own feelings, and they saw that's what I was doing well before I did. As a guy, I carried the stigma that I couldn't be on the receiving end of abuse. But if there was ever proof (for me) that a guy can truly be emotionally abused, it was my relationship with her."" — Thatdude878787 — Cygnus875 — savemoney2121 — dragonheartstring1 ""She always talked badly about her own family behind their backs (they were very nice to me). She'd always compare our relationship to her sister's and her husband's relationship (very jealous)."" — Market0 — RonSwansonsOldMan ""He became super controlling and would even ask her to weigh herself so that he could make sure she wasn't gaining weight, so that he could stay attracted to her. She FINALLY left this garbage human after a pregnancy scare. She's reconnecting with people, too, but many of those friendships are lost. If a person demands you to cut off your support system, they are not worth it. "" — Prannke — totally_boring — NeverStickEmTwice — tank_of_happiness ""Then, the baby was born, and again, he was very little help. He would play with the kid and occasionally change diapers, but all the extra dishes, laundry, shopping (with the baby in tow, of course), and cleaning were my responsibility, along with all the feedings. Soon, to his detriment, I realized, 'I could do this on my own, and it would actually be less work.'

I ate *one* Built Puff and ordered six more boxes before I finished chewing. True story.

Promising review: ""For anyone who might be a skeptic, please allow me to put you at ease. If you have hyperhidrosis, meaning it can be 9 degrees outside and you're still sweating under your arms, this product has the potential to change your life. I would sweat THROUGH a sports coat before noon. Enter the Sweat Block product. I've had it for three weeks, and it is life-changing. I DO NOT sweat under my arms anymore. I'm still on the original box that I bought three weeks ago. I had to write a review after I was cleaning the garage today in 85-degree heat...I was sweating through my shirt on my back...BUT NOT MY UNDERARMS. It is amazing!"" — Frosty McGee Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in packs of two and three). Promising review: ""Feel like expensive high-end hotel sheets. I normally use flannel sheets year-round because it’s the only material I like, but these are my new favorite. Very soft and cooling. Fit our bed perfectly. I purchased both for our bed and our spare room and have only gotten compliments from guests. Great sheets without the huge sticker price."" — Anna Greenlun Get it from Amazon for $34.97+ (available in 16 sizes and 45 colors). Promising review : ""Super happy with these pillowcases — both sides are fairly cool, but the cooling side never warms up, which is wonderful in 110-degree California summers. They do not smell (something I worry about with nontraditional linen fabrics). They do tend to get a little wrinkly, but since they zip up, they quickly smooth out."" — Tonia Get them from Amazon for $18.95+ (available in three sizes and 15 colors). Here's what BuzzFeeder Emma Lord (who convinced *me* to start eating Built Bars) has to say about them: ""Hello, I'm a walking cliché of Woman In Her Mid-30s Who Is Very Obsessed With Protein, since it took me three decades to realize I'm in a much better mood all day if I cram it in at every opportunity. I'm very, VERY picky about the protein bars I'll eat — Barebells and Nick's are my go-tos — and these Built bars knocked it out of the park! They have a truly marshmallow-like consistency and the most ridiculously satisfying texture and chewiness. The flavors I've tried have all been spot-on, and they don't leave any kind of aftertaste. I am perpetually out and about and in need of a snack, so I have one of these in my purse at all times!"" Get a pack of 12 from Amazon for $29.99 (available in several flavors). Promising review: ""The windows are noticeably squeaky clean and clear, and no scrubbing is required after only needing about 20 minutes to dry on a sunny day. I also used this to clean two outdoor glass dining tables, which are now ready for lunches and early dinners outside in the summer. Great product, definitely recommend and will be buying again!"" — Helen Simmons Get a two-pack from Amazon for $21.28 . Promising review: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months. It does have a white cast, but that can easily be worked into the hair to become undetectable."" — Meg B. Get it from Amazon for $6.97 . Promising review: ""After trying these, the pursuit for the most seamless underwear ended with these, and I came to write that on my way to buy a second pack. I worked at VS for three years, what seems like forever ago, and tried every “seamless” thong under the sun- at the store and otherwise- all of which rolled, were still visible, or the liner was not cotton, which just feels gross by the end of a workout or the end of the day. These aren’t that. They DISAPPEAR under all the workout attire. Anti-camel toe… HELLO?!?! They don’t hold sweat. They don’t roll. They don’t move around.  I just had my fourth baby and first C-section a couple of months back, and these are wide enough in the front. What is this panty sorcery? I threw out everything else from anywhere else. Follow the size guide. I washed in warm water upon arrival, even with the red in the pack, and none of the colors bled. I’ve washed 2x, and they look the same as when I first opened the box. They’re wildly comfortable for a thong from someone who despises every thong and even other styles of underwear I’ve ever tried. Picky lady problems, the list went on. Always something wrong about them on my body. NOT THESE! What!?!! I work out in these, run errands, housework ahhhh — they’re my new go-to that I ditched everything else. Comfy, sexy, stretchy, actually so seamless that they don’t exist under clothing, and a fantastic deal… It’s sorcery, I’m convinced ."" — Ebony Get a set of six from Amazon for $24.98+ (available in women's sizes XS–4X and nine color packs). Check out a TikTok of the plug-in fly trap in action. Promising review: ""I can’t say enough wonderful things about these handy little bug catchers!

Promising review: ""This scale with a built-in cup is the best thing for my baking tools. No more whipping out 1,000,000 cups.

Promising review: ""Bought this brush to replace my old travel brush. Love the storage compartment!

Promising review: ""I kept seeing this product on social media and finally decided to give it a try. I use this twice daily and it’s been a couple of weeks and I definitely noticed my pores have shrunk . I even apply it to my neck and chest area. Product is soothing, gentle on my skin (have extremely sensitive skin), no strong smell, cottons are soft, and did not cause any breakouts!

Snug Plugs is a small business that specializes in home improvement products. Promising review: ""Many of my appliances have a loose fit on my outlets, but with these in now, I don’t worry about my appliances being in a shortage because they fit so loose.

Does it make beer in a can taste like fresh draft beer? Absofreakinlutely!!!!"" — Ryan Jenkins Get it from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in seven styles). Promising review: ""Between myself (medium long hair) and my overly fluffy cat, a lot of hair and fluff was continually getting caught up on the roller brush of my vacuum. I dreaded vacuuming because it took so long to pull and snip the hairs wrapped up on the roller brush out with scissors. Not anymore! This silly, little, inexpensive thing works great! Super quick to remove all the hair/fur — in virtually a minute, then back to vacuuming with my lovely Miele vacuum."" — MKS Get it from Amazon for $8.99 . Promising review: ""Like you, when I first came across this, I was hesitant because of the price. It's a bit steep, I thought to myself. But then, after another night of bathtime with two towels on the ground to soak up the water my child had splashed all over, I took the plunge and bought it. And definitely worth it a million times over. My child LOVES the extra space for toys, and I love the water staying in the tub. I definitely and highly suggest buying it. You won't be disappointed! Or your child!!"" — Brianna Get it from Amazon for $59.95 (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I could kick myself for not trying this sooner! It is my new favorite lotion... After one night of using this, I woke up to smooth, soft moisturized skin that wasn’t itchy at all. This lotion goes on and absorbs beautifully. It’s not too thin or thick, and the scent is sensational... It’s not greasy or slick and does not have a residue that pills or transfers."" — TickTokAlice Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in a two-pack). Check out Qualify's Amazon landing page for more flavors! Promising review: ""Great product. I love the vanilla flavor for smoothies, oats, etc. It's the perfect way to get in extra protein for the day. Would definitely recommend this product!"" — Destiney Perez Get it from Amazon for $39.99 . Promising review: ""My spouse asked that I look into a product that helps lift a mattress, and she had seen this in an advertisement on the TV. This plastic tool aids in lifting a mattress so that sheets can be changed on the mattress. She told me that this product made it easier to lift the mattress and that her hands no longer ached as much as they did without using the product. She is satisfied with the product, and if she is, then I am also. I would order it again."" — Thomas Reed Get it from Amazon for $19.95 . This formula contains 4% Benzoyl peroxide, so reviewers without sensitive skin prefer this to the foaming 10% version , which packs a powerful punch. Promising review: ""This works like no other. Sometimes, when products have no lather, I can’t tell if it’s working, tbh. This has no lather but works! Improves breakouts and textured skin. I saw results in four days."" — Ellice D. Ellis Get it from Amazon for $9.77 (available in different sizes). Promising review: ""Words cannot describe how much I hate dealing with gas stations — whether it's getting gas, car wash, or air for my tires, I really hate being at the gas station for any length of time. I live in the Pittsburgh area, so the up-and-down weather wreaks havoc on my tire pressure and I am TRULY GRATEFUL to be able to check my tire pressure and fill them up from the comfort of my home. This device couldn't be easier to use, and the fact that you can lock the nozzle in place and fill the air hands-free is wonderful. I never leave reviews, but chef's kiss on this product. Can't recommend enough."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $31.98+ (available in two sizes and four colors). It also self-propels so you just need to steer, no hard pushing! Promising review: ""I confess I can be a lackadaisical housekeeper, which is problematic since my new dog sheds enough in a week for me to build an entirely new dog. What's worse, vacuuming doesn't pick up a lot of his fur. This Tineco is magic, though. Not only does it pick everything up (dust, fur, hair, crumbs, Nature's Miracle, errant Cheerios), but because the wheels are motorized, vacuuming/mopping is a breeze. I get exhausted using my canister vac, but this thing is a blast to use. Here is what I've learned: I always use the 'extra water' feature, which seems to work better. I clean the dirty water holder and parts every time I empty it, and I run the self-clean cycle after every second emptying session. This means I can do my primary bath and my 10x12 TV room before self-cleaning and recharging for a little bit. Or I can do my kitchen, entryway, and hall before self-cleaning, or my living room. In other words, you're not going to do your whole house on one battery charge or without running the self-cleaning feature several times. Of course, the reason you have to run the self-cleaning so often is because this little beauty is picking up So. Much. Stuff. It's magic. If it broke tomorrow (and I don't think it will break for a very long time), I would buy another. "" — Customer Get it from Amazon for $149+ (available in four styles). It comes with six hangers that can hold five garments each, 10 if you double them up! Promising review: ""I use these hangers for shirts and tees. They allow me to easily find any shirt in my closet and take up very little space compared to single shirts on single hangers. I can also group shirts together by style or color on a single swivel hanger. I am now able to hang additional items in my closet without crowding. I bought this in white and the edges are smooth."" — CAGH Get a pack of six from Amazon for $19.90+ (available in five colors and larger packs). Each cleaner comes with a trial size of Bissell's Spot & Stain Formula , which is also available on Amazon for $12.99 ! Promising review : ""I have four expensive fabric-covered chairs in my kitchen dining area that were long overdue to be cleaned and were so heavily soiled that I wasn't sure even a good cleaning would help. I researched all the available portable cleaning machines and this seemed to be the one with the best ratings and recommendations. I was amazed at the results when I used it on the chairs. Years of ground-in dirt and grime came out easily, and when I looked at the solution that was vacuumed out it was the color of dark chocolate. I did a second cleaning and then used a spray bottle to apply clean water to rinse. Honestly, the chairs looked so good even my son was so impressed he bought one. I want to add that I am very close to eighty. and I had no problems operating it. I highly recommend it, and I rate it five stars plus!"" — Kathleen Petro Get it from Amazon for $123.59+ (available in three styles). Kitsch is a woman-owned accessory brand that was founded in 2010. They sell a wide variety of beauty products and hair accessories for all hair types. Promising review: ""I ordered this because I was sick of keeping a towel on my head for so long while my hair dried , and if I didn't have a towel, my shirt was soaking wet from my hair after a shower. For reference, I had very long, thick hair and it takes a while to air-dry — and I'm so happy I found this scrunchie! It's a lot bigger in person than it looks in the image, which is great because it covers more of your hair to help dry it. No more heavy towels on my head or tight towel wraps . "" — Meghan Get a pack of two from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in two styles). Several reviewers say they just throw theirs right in the washing machine to clean it! They also make a smaller one designed for the bikini area and a long, narrow back scrubber for hard-to-reach areas. Promising review: ""MAGIC. HOLY CRAP, I LOVE THIS MIT! This cleared up 80% of the 'chicken skin' I have INSTANTLY after one use. Also, it took off way more dead skin than any scrub I’ve ever used. I never write reviews, so I had to when I got this and loved it."" — Cheyanne Get it from Amazon for $10.99+ (available in two colors and as a pair). Promising review: "" I've been searching for something to remove the weeds for a while, and came across this amazing tool. Since I refuse to use chemicals in my yard, I've been left with scraped knuckles every time I attempt to remove weeds. The weeds have grown so tightly in the concrete cracks that I pretty much gave up; even weed-whacking it didn't help much. Yes, you do have to use a little bit of effort, but the end result was so worth it !"" — Shelley Arakaki Get it from Amazon for $16.95 . County Line Kitchen is a small business specializing in mason jar–style cold brew makers, pitchers, and accessories. Promising review: ""This has been a hit in my house. Makes the most delicious cold brew and is of great quality. Has saved a ton of money on going out and on pods I used to buy. I try to let it sit for 48 hours so I can dilute it with a little water to get it to last longer, and throw it in my dishwasher in between uses. Perfect!"" — Jo Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes and four styles). Promising review: ""I recently tried this pimple patch and it’s incredible ! It’s truly invisible, blends seamlessly with my skin, and works wonders. It hides pimples effectively and starts working within hours, clearing them up in no time (usually within eight hours). Plus, it leaves no redness or scars behind! This product is a must-have for anyone dealing with breakouts. Highly recommended!"" — Robeir Edward Sarofeem Get it from Amazon for $6.98 . Promising review: ""I used this product for my stove because it's one thing I dislike cleaning. I have used different degreaser sprays and they all are so toxic and don't work for me. The Magic Eraser was okay but I used several at a time and I had to scrub so hard . But this product oh my goodness, legit a miracle. It doesn't have any type of smell . I put the paste on a cloth, clean the area then wipe it off with a damp cloth and voilà, magic!"" — May Get it from Amazon for $5.97 . Promising review: ""My dry neck and the annoying itchiness I used to experience have completely gone away after using this cream. It’s not only soothing, but it also feels like it’s really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It’s become a must-have in my skincare routine."" — JAcosta Get it from Amazon for $11.19 (also available in a two-pack). Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier.

This requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in six styles and five colors). These are also gluten-, soy-, and dairy-free! Promising review: ""No issues with the packaging. I love the lemon-lime taste. It dissolves in your water easily; I only used a straw to stir it up. It was not gritty, and after drinking a glass, I truly felt my headache vanish, which I felt coming on after a heavy workout! My husband uses them for hangover days when you just don't want to feel as if you are nearing death, LOL! Satisfied and definitely 5 stars. Great to have on hand."" — Britt Get a pack of 16 from Amazon for $23.46+ (available in different flavors and pack sizes). Promising review: ""I was hesitant to buy this, but I absolutely love it! It keeps my drinks cold for hours, the ice stays solid without watering the drinks down, and it prevents condensation. Perfect for iced coffee, soda, or any glass cup.

Check it out on TikTok here . Promising review: "" I have a really uneven skin tone, which is always accentuated in the morning. I don’t like putting makeup on when I wake up, and after seeing this on TikTok (I know I’m not alone in that), I bought it to see if it works, and OMG, it’s amazing. A little goes a long way, I put on sunscreen and dab this on my face and like magic, my skin looks even… even lessening [my] puffy under-eye! I never write reviews but I had to for this. It will forever be a part of my daily routine!"" — Sara R. Get it from Amazon for $25+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""LOVE.

BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Promising reviews: ""These covers are AMAZING! I used them for the first time this weekend during my bachelorette because of how much white I would be wearing, and they were perfect. I usually use petals, but sometimes you can see the shape of the petal, and my nipple still shows, but these covered my boobs perfectly, and you couldn't see them through a see-through white body suit. They lasted through the night when I forgot to take them off before bed and also lasted through tonsssss of sweaty dancing. I never leave reviews, but I had to spend the word. All my girls on the trip were amazed by them and are all ordering now."" — Amazon Customer Get a pair from Amazon for $26.50+ (available in three sizes, with or without lift, and five shades).

Click & Carry is a Shark Tank and QVC-featured small business that specializes in easy carry accessories. Promising review : ""TikTok made me buy it. This is great when you have a few bags and a box — for example, if you balance the bags, you can throw it over your shoulder and walk inside and have two free hands to carry the box, which is great. Product seems well built, and is comfortable on your shoulder or hand because of the padding."" — Hung Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I have a golden retriever and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back and forth movement! However I find it's a great arm workout and it works wonders."" — Joanne Ertel Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in four colors). Wad-Free is a small biz that was launched during the pandemic.

You wonder if things like this really work and well, I can absolutely confirm it does! First, I was impressed that the package came with two of the devices because I was only expecting one. So there was one for the fitted sheet, and the flat sheet. Finally, I tried it out and my sheets not only did NOT wad up, they came out of the dryer feeling fresher, feeling more dry, and unwrinkled! I will be buying a set of these for each of my immediate family members and close friends! What a great gift!!!"" — katy Get a two-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in a four-pack). Promising review : ""I saw these on an Amazon review video on YouTube and figured I'd give them a try because my boyfriend tends to leave the toothpaste bottle a complete mess and I can't stand it! These things have a great seal and give out a good amount of toothpaste when you squeeze it. It wipes clean very easily. So glad they come with more than one but not sure what I'll use the other ones on yet."" — Kimberly C. Get a set of three from Amazon for $6.45+ (available in seven styles). Promising review: ""After I had my first child almost a year ago, I stopped getting acrylic nails because I couldn't get him out of his car seat without struggling or breaking a nail. I’d have to get them as an overlay or extra short. But I saw this product on TikTok and had to try it out, and OMG!! It works! It took me a while to figure out the best angle to get him out with it, but once I did, I went to the nail shop expeditiously!! LOL, if you’ve been thinking about this for a while, GET IT! It’s worth it!"" — Tora318 Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in six colors and larger pack sizes).

I waited a few months before writing this review because I wanted to test the product first. I am just AMAZED! I have to say...depending on the season and the place on the spike where you apply it, you either get a keiki or a new flower spike (which is awesome!). Based on my experiments, the lower the spike, the more chances to get a keiki. The higher on the spike, the more chances to get a new flower spike. If you apply it during winter (tropical area winter), you will more likely get flower spikes. If you apply it during summer (tropical areas), you will more likely get a keiki — at least that's what I observed!"" — Anne-Isabelle Bonifassi Get it from Amazon for $17.07 . This product has over 50,000 5-star ratings ! Promising review: ""I have to admit, my expectations weren't very high. I thought it was more of a joke when my husband got this for me for Christmas. Little did I realize, it would be one of my favorite gadgets ever! I don't know if I realized just how many things went missing in my seat gap. It has really saved a lot of things from disappearing into that black hole. It was easy enough to fit into my car and it's soft! It's just like an extension of my seat, except it fits every curve of my seat! There really isn't another product that compares to this. That's why I gave it five stars!"" — Tessa Forbes Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Promising review: "" This item is super easy to use and cuts well every time. I've used it at least five times already and it works perfectly. It's such a great time-saver and I've even come back to buy more for other friends as a cute little gift. This little helper makes me actually enjoy wrapping presents!! Everyone should have one of these Little ELVES!"" — Cathy Bitner Get two from Amazon for $13.99 . Promising review: ""I am so glad I ordered an extra pack of these. My goal for January was to organize the basement. I have TONS of plastic bins and whenever I need something, I have to open each to find what I’m looking for. I took a few hours the first weekend cleaning out and organizing everything and the bins. I took pictures of the contents of each bin, put one of these stickers on each bin then associated the pics with the sticker’s QR code and voila, done. IF YOU LIKE TO BE ORGANIZED, GET THESE STICKERS!"" — Fred Labro Get a pack of 40 from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three pack sizes). Promising review : ""I was amazed how real this looks, even side by side with the real thing. Of course, when you turn it over, you can see the compartment, and you will have to add weight if you want it to feel real, but just sitting in the pantry, it looks real!"" — Brenda Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in eight styles).

Attention procrastinators everywhere, you're gonna love this eyeliner stamp that'll ensure perfect wings everytime. BuzzFeed Staff One side is the curved wing stamp, and the other is a regular fine tip liner for defining the rest of the eye. It comes in a pack of two, one for each eye. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty . Promising review: ""Got this before a trip I took a few days ago. I have never been able to do wing eyeliner properly so I was excited to try this. It's very pigmented and goes on beautifully! I've tried other liquid eyeliners before and they were so watery and not close to a dark black I wanted at all but this product was great. I did my makeup and put this eyeliner on at 9 a.m., traveled two hours, walked around a city for about three hours and it was warm so I was sweating, and then went to an NBA game. After all that time (about 16 hours!), the eyeliner was just as perfect as I had put it on! I love this product and can't wait to use it more often!"" — Elizabeth Get a set of two from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). Promising review: ""Exceptionally easy to use even for lazy people like me. I saw good gradual results despite only using once daily — very happy as I cannot tolerate trays and hate strips!"" — belle rouge Get a pack of two from Amazon for $17.95 (also available in three other sizes). Promising review: ""I am a licensed cosmetologist of 30+ years and I couldn’t be more pleased! Salon-perfect, shiny, bouncy blow outs! Dries and styles in one or two easy passes ( on damp hair) and provides maximum lift if I style it that way. Easily dries and styles large sections of hair making this THE BEST hairstyling tool! Highly recommend! I use the low setting and cool blast. Surprised and very happy that I don't need med/high settings. Only caveat I have come across so far: the temp/speed setting is in an awkward place to be able to change it while using. Learning curve, I suppose. Otherwise, another GREAT styling tool from Revlon! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"" — ERJ Get it from Amazon for $32.99 (available in 11 styles). Promising review : ""You need this! Super soft hair and cuts drying time! This stuff is seriously magic. I have thick hair and I hate drying it because it just takes so long. I separate it, pin it up and spray the bottom half and dry and then do the top. It’s perfect! Agree with some of the other folks that said you need to find the perfect amount...too much you could be greasy. But you’ll only do that once. Regardless it smells amazing and your hair will be so soft! Get this!"" — Jessica W Get it from Amazon for $16+ (available in five sizes). Here's what BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes has to say about it: ""I picked up this color removal sponge from Amazon after hearing about this hack on TikTok and can testify that it actually works SO well. I'm *so* bad about cleaning my brushes (I know...shameful) and this makes it super easy to clean a brush in a matter of seconds. So even if I'm trying to do a *slightly* more elaborate eyeshadow look for the day, this makes the process of switching colors as quick and painless as possible. Also, it's *super* lightweight, and I've already tossed it in my bag and brought it on vacation with me. This is one of those products I won't be traveling without in the future if I plan on doing eyeshadow at any point — and it means you only need to pack one or two eyeshadow brushes !"" Promising review : ""This product makes it even easier for me to be lazy when it comes to cleaning my brushes. It also allows me to use the same brush for a makeup look since I can swish away a previous shadow and move on to the next. Great buy. Super easy to wash. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, but when I do finally travel again, I'm sure this will be excellent to travel with and make it so that I only need to bring one or two brushes."" — Azaleah Bumpus-Barnett Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (also available as a pack of four). This device cooks up eggs in any style: hard-boiled, poached, omelet, or scrambled. BuzzFeed Shopping editor Emma Lord says, ""I've owned one of these babies and have faithfully used it every week for upward of two years, and especially love it while working from home — it simplifies breakfast because I know no matter what assortment of groceries I'm working with, there are precooked eggs to add some protein to it. (I like mine medium-boiled. 🍳) If my dinner is boring or seems like it needs a little extra oomph to it, I'll throw in an egg from this too. Some reviews note that the alarm on it is a little loud, but the new models have significantly decreased the volume and sing a little song instead! "" Promising review : ""I saw someone on TikTok with this and gasped! Ordered it right away. I had no idea these things existed. Super easy and convenient and the hard-boiled eggs came out perfectly. I’m testing a batch now without punching a hole in the eggs to see how they come out. Because why not make an easy process even easier?!?! LOL."" — Gina Get it from Amazon for $16.18+ (available in six colors). Promising review: "" The easiest lashes to apply!! With traditional lashes I really struggled because my hand wasn’t as steady and my eye would flutter while trying to put them on, but with the magnetic liner the lashes just latch on to the liner with no problem once the liner is semi dry. Definitely will buy a second set to have on deck. I recommend for those who struggle with regular lashes!"" — Tamara Get an five-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 . Promising review: ""When I bought my house in 2017, the upstairs bathroom had a shower that was nasty. I thought 'no problem' because I’ll just use elbow grease and clean it up. I scrubbed and scrubbed and scraped and used everything under the sun. NOTHING worked!!! UNTIL...The Pink Stuff. This stuff has done what no other cleaning product, no amount of elbow grease, no amount of cursing, no amount of anything of anything else has ever done. I’m relatively convinced it’s made with tears of the gods or just some magic that I wish I discovered years ago. My tub looks brand-new!!! "" — MNee Get it from Amazon for $5.49 . Promising review: ""I don't want to get all gushy over a pasta maker, but man...I really love this gizmo! I like spaghetti — either with normal Prego-type sauce or sometimes just with butter and Romano cheese sprinkled on. But I'm lazy and impatient, and don't like things that take a long time to make, with a bunch of steps, and a big clean up afterwards. The Fasta Pasta is perfect for me. I get the exact amount of correctly-measured spaghetti; it's faster than boiling water in a big pot then having to watch and stir the pasta; the pasta comes out perfectly cooked every time; and the cleanup is a snap."" — Smilin Sam Get it from Amazon for $17.95 . Promising review: ""I have very, very fine and fragile hair. It’s wavy (2b–2c with some 3a curls mixed in). My ends are dry, and my scalp gets very oily quickly. When the product arrived, I was on second-day hair. I worked the foam through my roots and the sides of my head. The most oily places for me. It was easy to work through, and it smelled fresh and clean. My results were amazing! My roots looked clean, no residue or buildup like powder dry shampoos. My scalp does not itch, and it gives my fine, flat hair a ton of volume. Also, my hair looks thicker when I use it. I usually can’t go more than a day or two without washing my hair. With this product, I was able to go four days without washing my hair."" — Amelia Tilton Get it from Amazon for $9.69 . Promising review: ""I've been a certified makeup artist for 12 years. Used for my cousin's wedding makeup, and they worked really well as far as catching fallout and shaping goes, but taking them off, they really stick, so just be gentle. Still great."" — Andrea Get a box of 120 pieces from Amazon for $6.99 . Promising review: ""We cannot BEGIN to tell you what a lifesaver this is! We have two old fiberglass tubs with vinyl shower enclosures that no matter what amount of scrubbing we have done with everything from bleach to cleanser to vinegar and baking soda would NOT come clean. After I took my shower last night, I sprayed down the tub and walls. Within minutes, all the built-up water deposits and dirt and grime began to melt away in front of my eyes. I left it on overnight, and when I got up this morning, it did not look like the same tub and shower. This product is a godsend, especially for old folks like us who have difficulty getting down on our hands and knees and scrubbing anything. More importantly, it performs as advertised. We plan on using it as part of our weekly cleanup routine, in addition to purchasing the Wet and Forget Mold and Mildew Remover for use on the vinyl siding of our house. This is truly an overnight sensation!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $20.98+ (available in two scents and three sizes). Promising review: ""Saw on TikTok (don’t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you’re left with a clean sink!

Uncle Funky's Daughter is a Black woman-owned company that was acquired by Renee Morris in 2014. She has used her own 20+-year natural-hair journey to expand the natural haircare line.

I just got it and already have had so many compliments."" — Meredith Coartney Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in 23 scents). Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container. "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in five styles and four colors). Fly By Jing is an Asian woman-owned small business that makes sauces, seasonings, and dumplings featuring flavors from Sichuan. Here's what BuzzFeed contributor Brittany Ross says about it: ""Ever since my sister introduced me to this life-changing condiment, I've slathered it on pretty much everything I could think of — from roasted vegetables and noodles to seafood and popcorn. It's got a kick, yes, and while I'm a big fan of spicy food, the thing I love most about this chili crisp is that it also has great flavor that doesn't get overpowered by the heat, which happens with so many other spicy sauces. That deep savory flavor comes from ingredients like fermented black bean, shallots, mushroom powder, ginger, and seaweed, so it's no wonder it's become my go-to pantry staple when I want to zhuzh up my dinner in a matter of seconds. PS: Some people even swear by it as an ice cream topping!"" Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in three sizes and three flavors). The razor has two edges, a fine tooth one for thin hair textures, and a wider one for thicker hair textures. (FWIW, people also use this on their pets as a quick grooming solution!) Promising review: ""I recently got a pixie haircut, I was hesitant to get one based on the fact that I'd have to get frequent haircuts, the cost of which would add up quickly. I did some research on YouTube and found some videos using the tinkle hair cutter to trim hair in between salon visits . I LOVE this thing! It is easy to give a little trim or a drastic cut, both of which I have done since getting the tinkle cutter . I was very nervous to try it, fearing that I might mess up my hair so I just did a little bit first, but it was easy and only takes off small amounts of hair at a time, remember, I have a pixie cut — if you have long hair it will cut that off! Basically all you have to do is comb your hair in the direction it grows until you're satisfied with the cut. Seven months post pixie haircut and I have only been to the salon once to have a re-shaping done of my hair. I will say that when the cutter feels like it's 'pulling' your hair, it's time to get new razors. I still prefer my pixie cut to be pretty short and assuming I would have to go to the salon once a month for upkeep I have saved $210 since having my hair cut. TOTALLY WORTH IT!"" — brandi in louisiana Get it from Amazon for $6.49 (also available as a two-pack). It suits all dishwasher machine makes and models. Just pop them into the tray where you'd normally put detergent (or on the bottom of your dishwasher if you're washing dishes at the same time), and run as usual! Promising review: ""This really works great for cleaning dishwashers. Don't tell anyone, but I haven't previously cleaned my dishwasher since we bought it about four years ago. It had a decent amount of funk on it and it started to smell funny. That's why I bought these tablets. I used one — put it in the detergent compartment and turned on the dishwasher on normal setting. After the cycle was done, all the sediment from a few years of use was gone and any unpleasant odor was nonexistent. Zero effort required, easy to use, and worth trying! "" — Agy Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $8.99 (also available as a 12-pack). Check out BuzzFeed's full write-up on this spray . Promising review: ""It WORKS!! Since my husband and I moved into our home two years ago, the hard water stains in our shower drove me wild! I tried everything from bleach to all-natural remedies. Nothing worked. Stumbled upon some before and after photos for this product and had to try. Especially for the price! The photos I posted were with minimal scrubbing. The product does all the hard work!!"" — Julie Dufour Get a two-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (available in four pack sizes). This is made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel. The simple lever system is what makes pulling weeds with this so easy! Grampa's Weeder is a family-owned small biz that sells tools to make weeding easier! Promising review: ""Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled."" — JG Get it from Amazon for $39.99 . It's BPA-free and dishwasher-safe! Also, it's perfect for parents who are still in that steaming veggies for the baby phase! Promising review: ""For years, I would buy those metal fan-like steamers that adjusted to the size of the pot; a good concept, but the fins would always fall off in short order, and they really were kind of a pain to clean (plus you had to clean the pot too!). This steamer, on the other hand, is ideal for me. It is the perfect size for a single serving and best of all, it's made for the microwave and not a pot on the stovetop. Cleaning is a breeze, and I usually hand-clean it so it's ready for another meal right away. It does take a few tries to figure out the timing for each type of vegetable, but that's okay — they come out crisp and fresh tasting. I'll never buy another metal steamer again. :-)"" — dvd Get it from Amazon for $15.49 . The temperature range is 32–197 degrees Fahrenheit. The cooker can be controlled right from your phone, so you don't even have to stay in the kitchen while cooking. It also provides cooking notifications and stays connected through Bluetooth from up to 30 feet away. Plus, you get access to over 1,000 recipes, so you'll have inspiration for yummy meals! Get the Anova app here . Promising reviews: "" For us lazy cookers! I use this at least three times a week. Great so you don’t have to stand in the kitchen waiting for your food."" — Craig R Payne III ""Since I started cooking sous vide, my family says my cooking has gone to a new level. I started with the original Anova and just recently picked up this Nano. The Nano is awesome because it's much smaller compared to the first Anova, making it easier to store in a drawer.  It sounds trivial, but by making it easier to grab, I'm more likely to use it compared to the Anova, which I kept in a special case in the pantry. Setup is so much quicker, and I can cook a beef roast for 30 hours without adding ANY water. If you're just starting out in sous vide, I recommend this cooker."" — Jeff Nichols Get it from Amazon for $78.96 . It's super quick to install, and one cartridge can last up to three months! Promising review: ""I've been using these on all my toilets for 60 days now. My toilets generally get a hard water ring around them within a few days of cleaning. It was infuriating, and I found myself cleaning toilets literally two to three times a week just to get rid of that little ring around the water line. These were so cheap, so I bought three of them and OH MY GOODNESS THEY WORK!!!!!! I've had these installed on all three of my toilets for 60 days now, and from what I'm seeing, I should be able to clean my toilets maybe once every two months now. I am so happy. If you have hard water build-up issues, do yourself a favor and buy one of these. Try it on a single toilet first just to be sure, but I think you will be happy :)."" — nima bean Get it from Amazon for $10.59 . This is dishwasher-safe! Promising review: ""A dorm room necessity! Makes pretty good rice fast and simple. Way tastier than minute rice, and no hassle of buying an expensive rice cooker or using the stove. Definitely recommend to lazy rice lovers or college kids who barely have time to cook real food."" — Cristina L Get it from Amazon for $19.90 (available in two stayles). Promising review: ""It's very light, with a huge capacity for soups, salads, mac 'n' cheese, spaghetti, stews, etc. If I didn't have any dishes, this actually would be the only thing I need other than a plate. Love the lid, as you can put it in the microwave, and the top does not blow off. It WILL stain with tomato based sauces. Who cares, as long as I've got my bowl I'm happy! Great for camping as it is virtually weightless. :) It's pretty much indestructible."" — Sheryl L. Ketchum Get it from Amazon for $14.24+ (available in three colors). Check out a TikTok of the butter spreader in action. Promising review : ""I remember having a butter holder, exactly like this, for corn when I was growing up. It was nice to find the same one. No more having the butter slip off the corn when applying it with a knife. No more tricks like using a fork and having the butter melt through the tines or how about buttering a slice of bread and wrapping it around the corn and spinning it. It’s also great that the butter is covered at one end by the plunger and the other end by a cover. This way, the butter will stay fresh and always ready when you need it."" — Allison Get it from Amazon for $6.95 . I personally have quite a few HexClad pans and a wok. I LOVE them. They have made the cooking and cleaning process a whole lot easier than it used to be. Heck, because of them, I end up cooking a lot more! Promising review : ""I needed to replace the old one I’ve owned for many years. Bought this nice HexClad 10” Wok for $95 on sale, with lifetime warranty. It’s a little pricey, but I think it’s worth it, especially, if I’ll never have to replace it! Nothing sticks to it, very sturdy, very easy to clean, not too heavy and it does as advertised. I’m looking forward to use this a lot for sti-frying, making fried rice, etc.. I do plan on buying the popular 12-piece set sometime soon."" — LAMARIZ@524 Get it from Amazon for $119+ (available in three sizes). Promising review : ""Where do I start?!?! This is honestly the best thing to have in your house . I sweep my house, and of course, the broom picks up the big stuff, but it’s the crumbs/ dirt/ sand, etc, the small stuff where even sweeping into the dustpan can’t collect it…. Well, with this device, say no more. I sweep those little crumbs, and it sucks it right up. It’s a breeze with the pet hairs as well. It makes cleaning easier. Easy to assemble. Good size, lightweight, and strong suction power. "" — Rachel Wangrycht Get it from Amazon for $149 (available in three colors). This robot vacuum and mop can even be controlled from Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri! I love this mop/vacuum combo! So I despise chores (as most people do), and as a busy mom of an infant who also works full time, keeping on top of cleaning is a lot harder that it seems. Between washing and sterilizing bottles, whipping up meals, and tidying up I literally find I don't have enough hours in the day for vacuuming or mopping. And then I got this baby. All I have to do is click a single button on the app or activate it via my Google Assistant (I named my robot Squidward, so I can say ""Squidward, start mopping""). First thing it did was map my home (pictured above), and then it started out the clean cycle. It moped my tile, and once it sensed a rug it switched to a vacuum, so my precious carpet was spared! I was amazedddd to see how well it cleaned up my floors! Plus, it totally did not crash into any furniture (and with an infant, trust me, there's a lotttt of furniture and gadgets strewn all over the place)!! It's a bit load when it's emptying itself out, but otherwise the actual cleaning portion of it is fairly quiet. All together, Squidward has proven himself to be an absolute time save for me. I highly recommend! Get it from Amazon for $599.99+ (available in white). Promising review: ""I bought this because I saw a TikTok about it. They really sold me on the video, but this is literally the best thing I could have ever bought off Amazon! When my son and niece are out of school for spring break or summer break, they are always at my house. They HAVE to have pancakes every morning, it seems. Mixing everything in the bowl and trying to pour that into the pan always makes such a mess, I feel. This eliminates the constant dripping off the bowl. It’s so easy to use; just throw all the ingredients in the bottom of this bottle, and you’re good to go! This is especially helpful with mini muffin pans! I love to make little bites at home, and this has been the best tool in helping make this baking project so much easier. So easy to clean; I just take it all apart, rinse it, and in the dishwasher it goes! Such a great purchase, and if you have littles who need pancakes more than once a week, this is for you! "" — Kristian Jones Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Wine Wash Co. is a small business based in Houston, Texas. Promising review: ""These work with all of our wineglasses, including my Riedels, thin champagne flutes, and crystal wineglasses. Our KitchenAid dishwasher came with a wine rack, but it didn't hold our taller wineglasses, so this little gadget did the trick. Very easy to use.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/monicatorres2/hardworking-immigrant-trope-rethink,Culture,2025-06-24T12:31:02.000Z,People Usually Think They're Paying Immigrants A Compliment With This One Adjective — Here's Why You Might Want To Rethink Using It,22,924,6,14,"This common phrase sounds nice, but it doesn’t take someone’s full humanity into account. HuffPost Writer In response to ICE raids in Los Angeles, Kim Kardashian, for example, wrote on social media that “When we witness innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families in inhumane ways, we have to speak up,” while Republican Rep. David Valadao of California, recently wrote that he is urging the Trump administration “to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully.” Being hardworking and productive are not bad traits, but when people exclusively praise and defend immigrants for being hardworking, it is not the full compliment people think it is. Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice, said when she grew up in Bolivia, working with “ahínco,” meaning to put “your soul and your heart into it,” was a good thing to be. But as a Latina, she has qualms when “hardworking” is used to suggest that “immigrants should just be doing the jobs no one else wants to do.” “I think the focus of the conversation needs to be on the fact that this administration is targeting people in an indiscriminate manner, and in that process, they’re really harming families and communities and really affecting not just their livelihoods, but their communities’ livelihoods,” Cárdenas said. It is true that immigrants do hard work, and without them, the American economy would collapse. The government estimates that about 40% of hired crop farmworkers that harvest food for our tables do not have work authorization. Immigrants are also the demographic that is most likely to work evenings, overnights, and on the weekends in a range of critical fields like health care, commercial bakeries, dairy and meatpacking firms, or in construction labor, according to a report from New American Economy . But they are also a vulnerable group that can get hurt on the job without recourse like workers’ compensation. Most immigrants who work on Wisconsin dairy farms frequently get hurt on the job and often go without medical care, out of fear of getting evicted and fired by employers or deported, as one 2023 ProPublica report detailed . Praising immigrants as hardworking “masks the degree to which, for so many immigrants, being ‘hardworking’ means working in risky, exploitative conditions, further sidelining people who are vulnerable, can’t work, unemployed, or trying to resist exploitation,” said Soraya Chemaly, an activist and author of the upcoming book All We Want Is Everything: How We Dismantle Male Supremacy . “Is a person [who’s] seeking safety and peace, but unable to work, deserving of care and dignity?” Chemaly continued. “In the end, the logic of ‘hardworking’ goes a long way to subtly reflect a deep strain of white supremacist, gendered, and capitalist logic in which people are ordered as resources, in terms of what can be extracted from them, rather than their inherent humanity.” Michael Lechuga, the chair and an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, said the focus on migrants’ hard work in the US has historic roots in the 1940s-1960s Bracero Program that allowed millions of Mexican men to work legally in the United States on short-term labor contracts. This characterization of migrants as braceros “limits or reduces the migrant to the bracero ... [which in Spanish means] the arm,” Lechuga explained. “All you care about is their arms. You don’t really care about their whole body.” He noted this focus on migrants’ labor persists to this day and can lead migrants to be “demonized” by conservatives for stealing jobs, but he noted the defense of those on the left that “No, they’re actually really hardworking” is not a useful counterargument, either. In both cases, migrants are “valuable only at economic terms, but any sort of a social responsibility that the state needs to provide for the well-being of the whole human ― that’s too much of an ask,” he said. As someone who grew up in an immigrant family, Lechuga finds that being called “hardworking” brings up mixed feelings. “On the one hand, it is a way to flatten who people are,” he said. “But at the same time, in my own personal experience, that was what we were told we needed to develop in order to advance in society.” He noted that being hardworking can become a narrative immigrants take on for themselves as part of their “assimilation narrative.“ Ultimately, a more inclusive, whole-hearted support of immigrants doesn’t need to come with a qualifier or caveats of what they do or will do for the US ― it acknowledges that their existence alone is worthy of care, dignity , and respect from the people and institutions that govern them. They are not just our co-workers ; they are our neighbors, relatives, and friends. Take what Los Angeles Dodgers player Kiké Hernández wrote on Instagram over the weekend to defend the people in his city being targeted by ICE. “This is my second home. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused, and ripped apart,” wrote Hernández , who was born in Puerto Rico and plays in Los Angeles. “ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity , and human rights.” Notably, he includes no commentary about how productive or law-abiding immigrants are or what immigrants do for the US economy as reasons they deserve respect and dignity. That emphasis on “all” is pointed, and one we could all learn from. This article originally appeared in HuffPost .",2025-06-24T17:14:55.710963+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff “The disease is what the disease is. And I think you have to be in real deep acceptance of what that is. But for where he's at, he is stable,"" Demi said at the 2024 Hamptons International Film Festival. “What I always encourage is to just meet them where they're at. When we're holding on to what was, I think it's a losing game.” “To hug you and ask you about life and your stories and struggles and successes,” she went on. “I wish I asked you more questions while you could still tell me about it all. But I know you wouldn’t want me to be sad today so I’ll try to just be grateful reminding myself how lucky I am that you’re my dad and that you’re still with me and I can still hold you and hug you and kiss your cheek and rub your head I can tell you stories.”  Referencing her 2-year-old daughter Louetta, Rumer added: “I can watch the way your eyes light up when you see Louetta I will be grateful for every moment I have with you. I love you so much dad happy Father’s Day. Sending love to all those who are in the boat with me or have lost their fathers.” And Tallulah took it upon herself to address the criticism by replying to this comment, explaining: “hi. I hear that. As a family we use our discretion when posting. Today was a great day filled with smiles. I made the judgement call to show that to the world, because I know what he means to everyone.”  Her words struck a chord with many, who praised Tallulah for having this approach. One person wrote: “As a caregiver for my mom, who battled Alzheimer’s for over 10 years, your posts are a beautiful way of showing the joy in the small moments. Having a network of families who share this experience, and who are NOT judgmental, is everything. Those making negative comments hopefully will never have to go through this. I wish you all the best. ❤️”  “Thanks for sharing Bruce with us. It’s good to see his smile and yours as well,” somebody else added.  Another commented: “This is a loving picture. There should be no criticism of her posting this picture. Bruce and his daughter are raising awareness, so this can be cured someday.”  While one more wrote: “It's really generous to let us see these moments, because you know how much we love him, too. ❤️” ",2025-06-24T17:14:55.860928+00:00

Simone Ashley reduced to a cameo in F1. Tracy Ifeachor and the other actresses of color left off The Pitt’s Variety cover.

Huffpost UK Writer Danny Boyle has admitted he doesn’t think he could make his film Slumdog Millionaire today. In 2008, Danny directed one of his most popular movies, in which a teenager raised in a Mumbai slum wins the top prize on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? , answering the questions based on knowledge he acquired over the course of his life. At the time, S lumdog Millionaire received near-unanimous praise, winning both Best Director and Best Picture at the Oscars, although it proved more divisive among Indian communities , with some critics suggesting filmmakers from India have not received the same reception for similar works. In a new interview with The Guardian to promote his new film 28 Years Later, Danny admitted: “We wouldn’t be able to make that now. And that’s how it should be. “It’s time to reflect on all that. We have to look at the cultural baggage we carry and the mark that we’ve left on the world.” He continued: “At the time it felt radical. We made the decision that only a handful of us would go to Mumbai. We’d work with a big Indian crew and try to make a film within the culture. But you’re still an outsider. It’s still a flawed method. “That kind of cultural appropriation might be sanctioned at certain times. But at other times it cannot be. I mean, I’m proud of the film, but you wouldn’t even contemplate doing something like that today. It wouldn’t even get financed.” Danny added: “Even if I was involved, I’d be looking for a young Indian film-maker to shoot it.” The British filmmaker’s new offering, 28 Years Later , is now in cinemas, rebooting the franchise he originated more than 20 years ago with 28 Days Later. He has previously said he hopes the movie can be the start of a new trilogy, with a sequel, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple , having already been shot, with Nia DaCosta on directing duties.",2025-06-24T17:14:56.380985+00:00

Williams Get them from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–11 and 26 styles). You can count BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord among this balm's many fans: ""I love love love this lip balm. I compare it to the $24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on — I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go. It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries."" Promising review: ""I got this product because of the hype of it on TikTok. This lip balm smells SO GOOD. And hydrated my lips."" — kayla Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five flavors). Promising reviews: ""I saw this little potato at a restaurant counter and loved the quote so much I bought one for me and my two best friends. Such a cute and motivating carbohydrate. "" — Ess Vee ""Purchased for my wife for giggles. I figured it would be just another [thing] that was fun to open and would disappear over time.

Promising review: ""This is one cute little powerhouse. It's a fan, a flashlight, and a power brick all in one. I got this a few weeks ago to help when I'm in the throes of a pre-menopausal hot flash. I've used it quite a few times, and I just had to charge it for the first time today. The fan has two powerful speeds, and I like that it has a quick automatic turn-off feature if the blades come in contact with anything; the blades are plastic and don't hurt, but it's still a nice feature. The flashlight is bright, and the charging feature is really great. I love it!"" — HolNicHai Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in six colors). Heads up! If you plan to toast marshmallows or do any other cooking over the fire, don't add this colorant until after you're done! Promising review: ""Mystical Fire Colorant is amazing. For a really fun experience, get some of these for your next camping trip. As if a campfire needs improvement...but this stuff is really neat. I'd say the adults love it even more than the kids. We only used one packet, and the colors were so good — it seems like they lasted at least 20 minutes. There was even color left in the ashes the next day. We will never go camping again without several packs of Mystical Fire on hand."" — TeNe Get it from Amazon for $7.20 . Schylling is a small business that specializes in modern and retro toys, games, and sets. Promising review: ""Great, and I love that it has a tray to sit on.

I’ve done an escape room before and was surprised at how well this card game mimicked it ! My 11-year-old and I did it together and did have to use some hint cards, but that aside, it was fun to try to figure out mostly on our own. You have to give it a try! We’ve already selected another game to play next."" — GMP Promising review: "" If you're new to the 'Exit, The Game' franchise, this is a great one to start with. It will give you an idea of how the games work, and the puzzles are varied enough that you can get a good idea of what their range is.

Get it from Amazon for $32.99 . Promising review: “I ordered this because my 13-year-old loves the game and I thought it might inspire her to want to learn to cook. I expected it to be more of a meme cookbook than anything, and it doesn't disappoint on that front! The illustrations are beautiful! and there are more than a few paragraphs devoted to the storylines and characters in the game. I did not in any way expect the recipes to be worth actually cooking. I was very surprised then to see how much effort went into turning awful-sounding dishes like ""Seafoam pudding"" into legitimate dishes. I am an experienced chef, and after reading through these recipes, I can say there are only a few that I am not excited about trying. Even the ones making familiar dishes have a couple of unexpected twists that sound really good. So to sum up, if you're a Stardew Valley fan, this recipe book is a no-brainer, and if you are a collector of interesting recipe books with unusual, but enticing twists, this is all a must buy."" — Zachary C. Hoskins Get it from Amazon for $18.38 . Note: Slight cracking can occur with air-dry clay, especially with larger projects. One way to help reduce them is by covering your craft with a damp cloth during the drying process! Promising review: Air dry clay is such a fun and inexpensive hobby to take up (versus regular clay pottery making: kiln, pottery wheel, etc). It’s incredibly easy to work with, easy to clean, and easy to store. I’m 23, and it is possibly my favorite pastime — I’d imagine it’s fun for any and all ages. This particular clay is just the best I’ve used, in my opinion. Others have been almost rubbery consistencies — and, although they dried beautifully and were easy to sand/fine tune, I just couldn’t get past how hard they were to get off my hands/tools/etc. This one is just perfect. — Lyss Get it from Amazon for $10.62 . The kit includes 2 wood carving blocks (1 cherry and 1 brasswood), a super sharp carving knife, sharpening supplies, a birdie template, and 3 types of sandpaper. Promising review: ""What a fun and relaxing project. Very easy to accomplish a bird figure with this kit. This is a very beginner-friendly project, and also fun for experienced carvers. The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, with pictures to guide you through the process. Everything you need to carve, sand, and finish the bird is provided conveniently in the kit. I really enjoyed crafting a bird figure with the kit and recommend this for anyone who wants to get into wood carving or is looking for an easy project for the weekend. Have fun and don't forget to strop the carving knife often to maintain a sharp cutting edge."" — J.leprgoblichaun Get it from Amazon for $32.99 . Lego has a few other potted plants, like these bamboo or chrysanthemum sets. Or, if you have a vase you've been wanting to fill, this cult-classic bouquet is a gorgeous, more intricate option.

The finished piece looks so realistic — I’ve had people mistake it for a real plant! It makes a great display piece and doesn’t require any watering. Perfect for Lego fans and plant lovers alike. Highly recommend as a gift or for yourself!"" — Jess H. Get it from Amazon for $23.98 . Promising review: “This book is wonderful for getting away from my phone and engaging with a great array of puzzles. With different difficulties and types, I can pick between a thematic crossword puzzle or just end my night with some colored pencils. This is an excellent nightstand book to end a long day of work!” — Samuel Get it from Amazon for $12.59 . The kit includes two sushi mats, a rice bazooka, cucumber and avocado slicer, rice paddles, sushi knife, dipping plate, nigiri maker, sushi brush, and four maneki-neko (chopstick holders). Promising review: "" This kit is a total blast for anyone who loves sushi, whether you’re just starting out or already know your way around a bamboo mat. The rice bazooka is a standout — it packs sticky rice into perfect cylinders for mess-free rolls, which is great for beginners like me who struggle with even spreading. The sushi knife is legit sharp, slicing through seaweed and fish cleanly without squishing the rolls, though I’d recommend hand-washing it to keep the edge pristine. The bamboo mats are sturdy yet flexible, and the avocado slicer made prepping ingredients a breeze. Everything’s BPA-free and dishwasher-safe (except the knife), so cleanup was no hassle."" — Martin E. Get it from Amazon for $22.09 . A few other popular Creative Haven books are Magical Fairies and Around the World , which is a color-by-number option! Promising review: ""Great therapy for my post-Lyme recovery, which still keeps me from my former more intricate crafts …and is beautifully relaxing after a long day at the office. Creative Haven makes some of my favorite coloring books — nice paper for colored pencils, nice detail, love the perforated pages, fabulous quality for the nice price point."" — Northwoods Charm Get it from Amazon for $4.79 . If you're looking for some markers to begin your coloring adventure, the Caliart alcohol markers are a great option — reviewers report little to no streaking! Note: This device requires Instax mini instant film , sold separately. And, if you’re looking for a sturdy case to protect your mini printer when you’re out and about, this one comes in 10 cute colors. Promising review: “I love this little printer so much. I actually bought the square printer a long time ago, but I’ve been wanting the mini one for a while now. I finally bit the bullet and bought it, and I have had no regrets since then. I use it for my scrapbook, and let me tell you, with the other printer, I have to lighten the picture a lot. But the picture quality here is amazing . You get what you print. Super easy to use and I can’t wait to use more of it!” — Lee Get it from Amazon for $89.90 (also available in white and pink). The kit includes 50 colors, 10 watercolor papers, a water brush pen, nylon brush, drawing eraser, pencil sharpener, sketching pencil, color chart, natural sponge, portable tin box, and velvet bag. Promising review: ""I LOVE this set. I'm a beginner and trying to paint one bookmark every day as I learn — 21 bookmarks so far. This kit makes it easy to take with me everywhere. All you need is a napkin and your paper, and you're all set. I do think it would be tough to make a large painting with this, but that's the same critique of any pan paints. I'm very pleased."" — Dee Bundy Get it from Amazon for $15.99 . The company offers a few other themes, like animals and enchanted forest . Promising review: “So peaceful. I was looking for something 'mindless' to do while listening to audiobooks. This is it! I can listen and not be too distracted from the story, and create beautiful sticker art. I thought it would feel juvenile or come out misaligned — not the case! Sophisticated and pretty!” — Freshlyberry Get it from Amazon for $10.65 . The kit includes 32 bottles of gel nail polish, a bottle of base, 3 top coats (no-wipe, matte, and glittery), a professional nail lamp, and some nail tools. Promising review: “Salon quality nail product!! I was apprehensive because of the price, BUT the kit worked exactly as described. I cured my nails for twice as long as is recommended, and I didn’t have ANY problems with runny or wet polish getting ruined. As others have said, the bottles are small, but to say “you can only use them once or twice” is an exaggeration. There’s more polish in there than that. It WOULD be nice if the base coat and top coat bottles were bigger than the rest because you’ll use so much more of it, but they aren’t. I’d buy this set again in a heartbeat!!” — Andrew jacone Get it from Amazon for $29.99 . Promising review: “ I have fibromyalgia, and it affects my feet if I don't wear good shoes . When my daughter asked me to take her roller skating the next day, I cringed at the thought of wearing rental skates. To my surprise, I was not only able to find women's size 11 skates, but they also offered next-day delivery to my address! These skates are super comfortable, durable, and high quality. I am excited for our new hobby!! ” — Melanie Cade Get it from Amazon for $60.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and men's sizes 4–11 and 4 colors). The complete kit includes two yoga blocks for support, a mat, a yoga strap for stretching, resistance bands, door anchor, and booty bands. Promising review: I’m very happy with this purchase, the mat is thick and comfortable. I like all of the additional pieces as well. The resistance bands are so well made and definitely give a good workout!!! I would 100% recommend! — Queen718❤️ Get it from Amazon for $59.99 (also available in pink) Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:14:57.248110+00:00
BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniesoteriou/brooklyn-beckham-nicola-peltz-proposal-best-decision,Celebrity,2025-06-24T13:27:48.000Z,Brooklyn Beckham Has Asserted That Marrying Nicola Peltz Is The “Best Decision” He Has Ever Made In A Defiant Instagram Post Amid His Rumored Family Feud,26,689,20,11,"Brooklyn’s gushing tribute to Nicola comes after he completely snubbed his dad, David Beckham, on Father’s Day. BuzzFeed Staff Throughout 2023, it was widely speculated that Nicola and Victoria were at odds , however, they appeared to put whatever beef they had behind them at the start of 2024, when they returned to being incredibly vocal about how much they adore one another in social media posts.  But this didn’t last very long, with the feud rumors resurfacing earlier this year when it was noted that Brooklyn and Nicola had skipped all three of his dad, David Beckham’s , 50th birthday celebrations, which spanned from March until May.  A source later told People : ""There are tensions between Brooklyn and Nicola and the family,” before insisting that “the relationship is definitely not beyond repair.”  The insider also said that the couple had been invited to David’s celebrations but chose not to attend, adding that the Beckhams “love and are always there for” Brooklyn, but are “hurt and disappointed that he’s now playing no part in family life.” According to a source who spoke to People , Nicola left the room in tears and feels as though Victoria “ruined her wedding.” Another insider added to the same publication: “Brooklyn feels torn. It’s his family and blood, but he’s always had a complicated relationship with his dad. A lot of their relationship has felt like ‘business.’”  It’s worth noting that the wedding was three years ago, and it isn’t known why any ill feeling between Nicola and Brooklyn and his family would have resurfaced now. And his cryptic Instagram post came soon after Cruz seemingly sprang to his parents’ defense after Brooklyn called Nicola his “whole world” in a divisive Instagram post that appeared to allude to the family beef.  “My whole world x I will love you forever x I always choose you baby x you’re the most amazing person i know xx me and you forever baby,” Brooklyn wrote at the time, sparking backlash from followers who accused him of shading his parents.  But Brooklyn is standing firm, with the 26-year-old shocking people when he completely snubbed David on Father’s Day earlier this month, despite David gushing about all of his children, including Brooklyn, in multiple posts that were shared throughout the day.  Brooklyn also publicly ignored his dad being awarded a knighthood by King Charles III the day before Father’s Day, despite the rest of the family sharing their pride. After being asked: “What’s something about love you didn’t know before this relationship?” Brooklyn replied: “You should marry your best friend. Someone who feels like home. For me, that’s Nicola.”  He also suggested that he is not interested in the constant scrutiny that their relationship with his family faces when asked how he protects their romance in the public spotlight. He said: “Ignore the noise. Keep your head down, work hard, be kind. People are always going to talk. What matters is that we’re happy together.” Sharing a photo of himself kissing Nicola on the cheek as she takes a mirror selfie, Brooklyn wrote: “It’s been 5 years since I asked this beautiful woman to marry me xx best decision ever x I love you so much ❤️”  However, some found this post to be in bad taste as they called Brooklyn out for appearing to choose Nicola over his parents and brothers in the comment section.  “Not cool how you’re treating your parents and brothers,” one person wrote. Another popular comment advises: “One day, you will realize that your Mum and Dad won't be around forever, and believe me, unless they have done something totally unforgivable, you need to make your peace or you'll regret it until your dying day. I dont know you Brooklyn, but maybe take a little time to assess your values and more importantly, your direction in life.”  “It’s a shame you allowed it to come between you’re parents and siblings. Really sad,” somebody else added, while one more wrote: “You will regret missing out on such wonderful family moments. Falling in love is wonderful! Remember the start of your journey into life.”",2025-06-24T17:14:57.382525+00:00

I tested it on all the different areas of my body. It didn’t do a thing to my well-exfoliated palm, but my face, legs, LIPS… baby soft with big balls of dead skin coming off . Like one of those Korean exfoliating gloves, but you don’t have to scrub like you do with those. You just gently rub it in, and your dead skin peels away .

Wonderful!"" — Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). Promising review : ""This 100% works. Two weeks after the first use and I’m afraid to say it out loud but we have ZERO drain flies. We’ve been inundated every spring and summer for the last few years. Biblical plague level. Nothing has worked: baking soda, boiling water, other drain treatments. Nothing. Until Terro. I will buy this every year until I die. "" — Seth Parry Get it from Amazon for $15.97 . Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms.

I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" — Monica T. Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" — Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.99 . Quitch is a small business that specializes in family-friendly bug repellent and bug bite relief products. Promising review : ""I don’t know how this works but it helped my itching SO MUCH! It sticks quite well and even stayed on after a shower. I got them because I was traveling to an area that had lots of mosquitos. I would be itching so bad but once I placed one on the bite, it reduced the itching to almost nonexistent. The pack comes with different sizes. It’s helped with not scarring my legs from the bites. I’ll definitely rebuy this for summer. It’s so easy and great to just throw in your bag."" — Holly C. Get a pack of 36 from Amazon for $9.95 .

I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify!

Here's what BuzzFeeder Jenae Sitzes says about it: ""I finally tried out this tool with my Crave Naturals brush , which I used for (*checks Amazon order history*) TWO YEARS without every doing a deep clean of it. I mean, sure, I would regularly pull out the loose hair and whatever I could get to using my fingers, but there was always this gross layer at the bottom I couldn't reach, and I kind of just tried my best to pretend it wasn't there. LET ME TELL YOU: This tool is genius. With barely any effort, it pulled out that gross, years-old layer of *stuff* at the bottom of my brush (the photo above shows that layer already ~dislodged~ by the tool , right before I pulled it out), and now I don't have to feel disgusting every time I run it through my hair . It actually feels like it's doing a better job of *brushing* now too! Seriously, if you are a human with brushable hair on your head, you need this."" Get it from Amazon for $11.95 .

My husband has had a lot of earwax impaction problems in his life, and up until this point, we have paid to have a professional take care of it. But recently, he suddenly lost about 80% of his hearing and just couldn't wait for an appointment, so we bought this item. From the reviews I have read, it was a particularly easy solution for my husband. Nasty huge chunks start falling out after just a couple of squirts. Cleared everything out, no problem.

Promising review: ""I recently tried the Olay Super Serum Body Wash, and I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is incredibly hydrating, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth after every use . It lathers beautifully and has a lovely, light fragrance that isn't overpowering. After just a few uses, I noticed my skin looked more radiant and felt deeply moisturized. The addition of serums in the body wash is a game-changer. My skin feels nourished, and I no longer need to apply lotion right after showering. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a luxurious, skin-loving body wash!"" — Darina ""I have been using Dove moisture body wash for a long time, but it just wasn’t getting the job done.

I also have fairly sensitive skin and this has yet to cause any irritation on my lips which is a huge plus.

Promising review : ""The 'abrasive sponge when cold' or 'squishy when hot' is an awesome feature for the type of scrubbing you want to do. The Pink Stuff with the sponge does wonders!

It provided instant cooling relief and took the sting out of my sunburn right away . The spray made it easy to apply without having to rub it in — perfect for those sensitive areas. The aloe was super soothing, and the lidocaine helped calm the burn fast. It absorbed quickly and didn’t leave any sticky feeling behind. Definitely a must-have for any sunny vacation or cruise — I'll never travel without it again!"" — Barbara Get it from Amazon for $9.98. Promising review: ""I saw this product on TikTok and decided to try it out for myself. The name doesn’t lie — spray it on, shut the bathroom door, and in a few hours, the shower is 100 times cleaner. Usually I’ll let it sit overnight, and by morning, the visible grime on the shower is gone, including soap scum. I’ll usually let the shower water rinse the residue out, and then will take a bucket just to get everything off the shower walls. It is a bit slick if you try to get in the shower without rinsing the residue, but otherwise it’s a worthy cleaning staple in my house."" — Tara D.

Promising review: ""This stuff really is magical! When we moved into our house, the previous owners did a horrible job of cleaning the stainless-steel appliances. There were permanent run marks going down the front that I could not remove....and I tried EVERYTHING. I should note that I’m not actually positive that these appliances are true stainless steel or just manufactured to look like that. I wanted to cry tears of joy after wiping down the dishwasher because I had been looking at those awful run marks for three years, and they were finally gone! The whole tub is worth it for that appliance alone. "" — MayBae Get a pack of 90 from Amazon for $14.98 . Promising review : ""These are the best for half of any round fruit or vegetable.

I had originally bought a completely different brand (because I was being cheap), and let me tell you, you get what you pay for. I found these Loop earplugs and decided to give them a try and I’m so glad that I did! They are so comfortable! Made from silicone so they are flexible and fit great . I’ve slept with them in all night without issues. The noise cancelling is fantastic! Now does it block everything? No, but I think that’s a good thing for safety reasons. They do block my husband’s chainsaw snoring and that is exactly what I needed them to do.

Joesoef Skin Care is a small business that specializes in anti-acne skincare products. Promising review: ""I recently saw a dermatologist talk about those clogged pores on and around your nose. If they are of uniform size, they aren't blackheads. She suggested using a sulfur soap to get rid of or minimize those stubborn clogged pores. This has a slight sulfur smell, it is not overwhelming, and it disappears when dried. It works! My pores are much smaller. After applying and drying, moisturize.

The cost was $700 but I could have one for $500. I decided to try a less expensive alternative. I purchased these and woke up this morning pain free. They are comfortable and I had no problem falling asleep. Pain is gone and I saved $500. I would say that's a win-win.

Promising review: ""I rarely ever get pimples, but every once in a while, when I do, they seem to last forever. A coworker of mine suggested I try this. I am SO happy I did. I had one very large pimple and two tiny ones — when I used this, they were all gone by the time I woke up . It does have a semi-potent smell, but it goes away after applying. I have never used a product like this before. I am so pleased to have this. I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this did not irritate my skin at all. I find it fun to put on. Would definitely buy again in the future."" — Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $20+ (available in glass or plastic bottle, and in packs with drying patches). Juno & Co. is a small business specializing in personal care and skincare products. Promising review: ""I’ve loved the Farmacy Green Clean for many years, but at $30+ for a jar that lasts 1–2 months max, it was a pricey product to buy on a regular basis. I wanted something just as good at a lower price and I FOUND IT! This cleanser absolutely melts away makeup and deep cleans the skin without any drying or eye irritation!

You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review : ""Like a lot of women over 50, I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas . Best of all, it does not settle into pores or fine lines at al l. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" — Chartwell Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted). First Aid Beauty is a US-based small business that specializes in clean, fragrance-free, cruelty-free personal care products. Promising review: ""These have been a game changer for me! For as long as I’ve been shaving, I always end up with bad razor burn and ingrown hairs :/. I switched to waxing for a while, but with summer around the corner that’s not ideal to keep up with. I was looking for a product that would help soothe my irritation and decided to try these. They’re easy to use and have really helped my skin! I use them right after my showers when I shave (armpits and down below) and then in the mornings the next day to keep irritation down, and they’re great. No burning or weird residue left after. 10/10 would recommend!"" — Tori Wag Get a set of 28 pads from Amazon for $18.53 . Promising review: ""First off, if you have extremely oily skin, this. is. it. I was so tired of getting blotting powder/wipes. It felt wasteful and always left residue on my face. I saw this on TikTok and NEEDED it. It was backordered but then I got an email saying it was in stock and I was SO excited. Not only is it affordable, but it's washable, which helps you save money and be less wasteful."" — Kelsey B. Get it from Amazon for $7.75 . I have been buying a new set of these every year since 2020, and they have kept my VERY blister- and chafing-prone feet snug and moisture-wicked on every single long run . They've essentially phased out any of my other socks, because they're extremely comfortable to boot. As a runner who often clocks in 25+ miles a week and often in some ""yikes!"" summer heat, I cannot recommend these socks enough. Promising review: ""These socks are designed perfectly for running socks. The bottoms and toes are thick, the tops are thin, the lower heel is reinforced, the heel top has a tab that provides extra cushion on the Achilles where some shoes like to wear into you.

Peach Slices is a small business that specializes in affordable skincare products. Promising review: ""I use these once a week and they really help my huge nose pores look way smaller and cleaner . The first time, I still had some oil and gunk in my pores, but the second time, I had even less. By the third time I used them, the only oil was on the patch, and my nose has never looked better. My pores appear smaller, and my nose is smoother."" — Sarah Cavasos Get a pack of seven from Amazon for $9.98 . First Aid Beauty is a US-based small business that specializes in clean, fragrance-free, cruelty-free personal care products. Promising review: ""I saw a dermatologist recommend this on TikTok, and I figured I’d give it a try. I have had red bumps on the back of my arms for as long as I can remember and have tried multiple things, so I didn’t have very high expectations . After one use, I could already see a difference! It says to use it 1–2 times a week, but I use it usually every other day, and I use Cerave rough and bumpy lotion after, and now my red bumps are almost nonexistent. This product has truly been life-changing, and I would recommend it to anyone struggling with red bumps! 10/10! "" — Sydney Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes).

This shampoo was designed to work for sensitive scalps, color-dyed, and chemically processed hair, as well as for all hair types and textures, with reviewers with 3b–4c curls mentioning it worked for them. Promising review : ""I was hesitant. I have been dealing with dandruff for almost 10 years, fortunately not that heavy but enough where it was embarrassing. I tried everything. Leave in conditioner, tea tree oil, Head and Shoulders, etc. One brand did work for a couple of days but that's it. But this product has worked EFFECTIVELY. Dandruff-free for two months so far. Can leave your hair feeling a little dry so just use conditioner and it will balance out. If other products aren't working for you with dandruff I can confidently recommend this one."" — Martin C. Get it from Amazon for $15.88 . Promising review: ""TikTokers have done it again. This was one of the products on Amazon a person could not live without, stating all-day freshness. It's true, I cannot believe it. The taste isn't strong. It does not burn at all. It keeps my breath smelling fresh all day, no matter what I eat. This brand will be a new staple in my bathroom and morning routine."" — Zac Get a two-pack from Amazon for $15.34 . You should change the pads every 48 hours, and note that they do not work on moles, birthmarks, warts with hair growing from them, genital warts, or facial warts. The brand notes that you should not use this product if you have diabetes or poor blood circulation. Promising review: ""These work amazingly well! I had taken my daughter to the dermatologist and paid a hefty amount for them to burn a wart off of her arm . It didn’t get rid of it; they only made it smaller, and they recommended a follow-up appointment. Then I found these! She wore one overnight, and literally the next day, it was smaller to almost nothing. Looked just like a small scar. Now it’s completely gone after wearing it only two times. One time overnight, and the next day. That’s all! I will never try any other treatment for warts except for this!"" — Cole Hagele Get a pack of 14 from Amazon for $7.29 . Promising review: ""I was skeptical at first, but I’m so glad that I purchased this. I finally cut my hair short after losing so much hair and thinning.

BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: ""It is a lifesaver . If you can't fit or afford a full sit-stand desk, this unit has been going up and down a few times a day for 6 months strong . Also if you think you will be standing for more than a couple of hours a day, I assure you no.

I have a FlexiSpot electric standing desk at home ( this one, specifically ) and love it — it's a great brand, and mine hasn't given me any issues over the past few years.

It will be the perfect addition to your workspace."" — Rebecca Jeanette ""After assembling it, I am thrilled I chose this desk. With a press of a button, I can raise and lower it to appropriate heights for either comfortably sitting or standing (I'm 5'10""). The material itself is very sturdy. There are NO drawers, which, after 20 years of having the other home desk and having desks at work, I realized that drawers do nothing more than collect and store junk. Can't do that with this desk as this desk encourages minimalism and storing that junk somewhere else."" — David Taylor Get it from Amazon for $149.99+ (available in five sizes and 12 styles).

I work from home and having the ability to hop on this thing regularly throughout the day is a lifesaver. The quality is top-notch, no issues whatsoever in the 3 months I’ve had it. Not having the room (in both my space and budget) for a treadmill, having cardio equipment that allows for a natural standing, upright position is critical for keeping my back healthy.

This product is amazingly perfect, so much so I bought a second set for one of the drawers in the kitchen."" — Gentles Lewis Get a six-piece set from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in two larger sets). I've had this exact lumbar support pillow since 2018, back when I was still working in an office, and I can't express enough how much it's improved my posture and reduced back pain after long hours of sitting . I initially got it because I was stuck working in one of those awful office chairs with zero lower back support, and years later, I still use it at home. It fills the curve of your spine *perfectly*, and you can adjust the positioning as needed, with straps that go around the back of your chair to hold it steady. I personally use it in conjunction with an ErgoFoam footrest , and I never have back pain after working anymore. Promising review: "" Saved my life . I bought this for work and it’s been so incredibly comfortable for my back, especially since I’m a petite and short person, I can’t sit against the chair or else my legs will be strained.

If you’re short I would recommend getting this + a footrest ."" — Aja Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in five pillows and a bundle with their seat cushion). The cover is removable and washable! Promising review : ""I have a cute but not great desk chair that I sit in all day in my home office, and my back was KILLING ME — it was making an old tailbone injury worse, and my spine was hurting a lot. I didn't want to spend $$$ on a new desk chair, and I figured this pillow was a good way to bridge the gap. I've been using it 8 hours a day for two months, and it's fantastic. I have zero back pain at all anymore, and it's sturdy and hasn't worn out or gotten less cushy. Highly recommended, and much better than getting a fancy new ergonomic desk chair that costs hundreds of dollars."" — Bee_87 Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in six colors).

Sleek Socket is a small biz focused on sleek power outlet solutions for the home! Promising review: ""I have a velvet lounge chair that sits up against the wall and covers an outlet. Every time we need to plug our phones, vacuum, laptops, or anything, I would have to move the chair to ensure the cord/plug doesn’t ruin the material. This outlet cover was a lifesaver! Lays perfectly flush up against the wall with the added befit of a third available plug, and sits neatly under my lounge. Love this product!"" — lisa ledoux Get it from Amazon for $21.95+ (available in four sizes and two styles). This whiteboard also comes with a dry-erase marker, an accessory channel (to hold the marker), and a storage drawer. Promising review: "" When working from home, this was a lifesaver! I saved paper by jotting down reminders, notes, and to-do lists that stayed in sight, and therefore, on my mind. I no longer work remotely, but this continues to be useful for home life reminders, such as bill payments, shopping lists, and the next shows to binge, LOL. I use the marker that came with it, as well as markers from other brands, such as Expo."" — D. Williams Get it from Amazon for $26.99 (available in five styles). Promising review: ""Absolutely love these cable clips. I have used them around my desk for holding charger cables so they don’t continuously fall. It has also been great with holding up to four charging cables for charging all my children’s school tablets. This has been a lifesaver with keeping these organized amongst all the chaos right now. Highly recommend."" — Leighann R. Get a six-pack from Amazon for $6.97 . Promising review : "" For anyone with cable clutter, this is a god-sent solution. You can even stick it if you're mounting it to a wall. These days everything is electric and there are just too many wires in my house. I can used this to make everything look clean again. I love how my house looks now. Lifesaver! "" — David Rizk Get a pack of six from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in three colors). It comes in two pieces — one you can prop in front of your keyboard, and the other in front of your mouse. Promising review : ""Being that I have carpal tunnel, the pain in my wrist and arm was becoming unbearable. I ordered these while working from home and these have been lifesavers. The pain has subsided and I wish I’d purchased these sooner. Excellent purchase and highly recommended!"" — BlessedMomma Get it from Amazon for $13.81+ (available in 15 styles). I use this mat anytime I use my standing desk in its lifted position, because standing barefoot on my hardwood floor for any lengthy period of time is *not* the greatest feeling. That said, you can use this with shoes on, too, if you're at the office! It's designed to wipe clean . Promising review: "" This mat has been a lifesaver with my standing desk . It has a nice cushion in depth and has enough width to allow for some movement. It stays in place when I need it too, and while it is a bit difficult to clean, it's a great overall mat for my needs. I liked it enough I bought a second one when we returned to the office!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in 10 sizes and in eight styles). This cordless mouse is recommended for small- to medium-sized hands — if you have large hands, Logitech recommends the MX vertical mouse ! Get a closer look at this mouse on TikTok , where the reviewer talks about how much more comfortable they find using it compared to a traditional mouse. Promising reviews : "" I have carpal tunnel so this mouse is a lifesaver. I've been using an ergo mouse for a few years and will NOT go back to the traditional style. This is a wonderful small investment that makes a huge impact on my life! EEEEEK THANK YOOOU."" — Barbie Larrinaga ""This mouse is perfect for smaller hands, or people who have any kind of hand pain . I find this extremely comfortable. The buttons on the mouse are very easy to push, and they’re quiet. If you have any arthritis or discomfort in your hand, this is perfect!"" — Jaye Hockenberry Get it from Amazon for $79.60 (available in three colors and right- and left-handed styles). Promising review : ""Thank goodness I came across these mats! Lifesaver when it comes to my mouse falling off of the small mouse pad. Nice and comfy for my small computer table. Just what I needed. A MUST have."" — Regina Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in 17 colors and five sizes). Promising reviews: ""This has been a lifesaver for my eyes !"" — Robin OConnor ""I love this product. I always buy one when I move into a new office. It’s basic, but it works. Clip adheres very well to my computer monitor when both surfaces are clean and dry. Use some rubbing alcohol to clean both services before trying to adhere it. I like this document clip because it helps me be more productive. I also use it to hold papers that need my immediate attention if I am not doing data entry. In summary, I’ve purchased this product many times for a reason. It does the job with no frills and it’s a great value!"" — Cassidy Get it from Amazon for $12.27 . I've had this cooling pad since 2018, though I mainly use it with my personal laptop when I'm playing PC games. The pad itself is super quiet and not distracting, and it does a fantastic job of actively cooling down my now-older laptop while it's working hard to run games, so I can vouch for its effectiveness. It's also *fantastic* to use while you're working with your laptop on the couch, keeping your legs away from the heat without feeling bulky or heavy. If you're using a MacBook, be sure to pick up a USB-C hub to connect this (I've used this one for years and like it!). Promising review: ""My MacBook Pro has been a nightmare to work on this summer. After working for about 4 hours, the keyboard is jumpy. Loading tabs, websites, and programs take forever because it heats up as the day progresses . I realized the heat was mostly the issue after placing ice packs and frozen peas under the laptop to cool it down. I purchased this cooling pad, and the difference is amazing! No more frozen peas! It is running like new again. Whoop!! Lifesaver , I am sure that the laptop is a lot happier too. :)"" — Liz Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (available in three colors). Reviewers suggest turning the heat down from high to medium once the drink gets down to about the halfway point so it stays a comfortable temperature! I can vouch for this mug warmer: It not only looks good, but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long (because yes, I'm one of those people that'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!). I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for use with this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste. Also, I looove how sleek the white version looks on my white desk, and the auto-shutoff function is a nice safety feature as an absent-minded person. Promising review : ""This product is part of my answer to coffee or tea which goes forgotten while I get smacked with a call or Zoom or projects or scheduling, which always seems to happen just as I'm pouring a hot cup. A lifesaver, especially for working from home ."" — E. Johnson Get it from Amazon for $21.74+ (available in nine styles). Remember to also stand up every hour or so to give yourself a break from sitting! And the brand recommends acclimating yourself to it slowly since you'll be using different muscles in a kneeling chair than you normally would in your traditional office chair. Promising review: "" This chair was a lifesaver . I work from home and spend most of my day at a desk, I was having some pretty decent lower back pain from my chair and noticed my posture suffering. I started looking for a better option and found this chair. It took about a week to get used to and for my core muscles to adjust but even during that time I noticed it was more muscle soreness as opposed to spinal pain. Now I absolutely love it!"" — C & J Get it from Amazon for $99.99 (available in three colors). Each of the attachments has a sticky film that's strong enough to adhere to your monitor, but easy enough to remove that it won't damage it. Promising reviews: ""This product is a lifesaver if you need lots of reminders . I love it."" — Linda Joy Rumph ""I have 568 stickies on any given day and this is exactly what I needed to keep myself organized. It came packaged nicely, no cracks or scratches, and was easy to adhere to. The adhesive is awesome. It's not going anywhere!!! I recommend this to anyone like me who needs a cool place for their notes. You will be the envy of your coworkers!"" — Mason's Mom Get it from Amazon for $5.97+ . Each folder can hold up to 25 sheets and the whole thing can be collapsed and secured with the attached cord for easy transport — which is *so* convenient if you're working a hybrid office-WFH schedule. It even comes with blank stickers for labeling the tabs. (Check out our Smead wall organizer deep dive for more deets on how helpful it is!) Promising review: ""Wow! What an absolute lifesaver! This wall organizer is perfect in my very limited office space! I bought it because I don't have much room and I hate an unorganized office which was beginning to happen. I found this and thought it was adorable (I love the colors). I hung it on my wall, filled it with papers, looks great, and saves a lot of desk space! I think I'm going to buy a couple more! LOVE IT!"" — Kari Get it from Amazon for $8.51+ (available in four colors). BuzzFeed Shopping editor Kayla Boyd loves her floating bookshelves: ""They save a lot of space and since I colorized them, they look like fun decor in my room. It definitely helps me get excited about reading more since they're so cute and visible. The shelves were also super easy to hang and they're very sturdy."" Promising review: "" Sturdy, easy to install, and a lifesaver. I am one of those folks with object permanence issues — if I can't see it, I'm liable to forget it's there, so it helps me to have things out where I can see them. These shelves are easy to install, look cool, and clear up so much desk space while I'm working on several articles or research projects at once. Yeah, the large shelves are a bit too big for most covers to catch and create the invisible/floating effect, but that doesn't bother me. The hardware that came with the shelves worked well on my plaster walls — just needed a drill, a pencil, and a level."" — Sara Potter Get them from Amazon for $21.51+ (available individually or in a set of three, and two colors). Promising review: ""I love this so much. The only part that was difficult was cutting it correctly. Besides that, this is amazing. I live in a townhouse so there’s literally zero privacy as soon as I open my blinds. Not anymore! I work from home, so I’m home all the time and this is a lifesaver. Also, I’m no longer the naked window neighbor! LMFAO! I need more of this stuff ASAP!"" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in 14 sizes and four colors). Great Useful Stuff is a small biz based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Promising reviews: ""Awesome product! I was looking for a way to keep all our tech stuff off my kitchen counter, this was it! It has been a lifesaver — keeps our items charged and in one spot!"" — Amazon Customer ""It is so simple. It required no setup and the magnets that hold the bottom compartment on are strong. I literally did zero work for this product to help me out so much in my everyday life. It clears up my desk clutter and charges my electronics. Plus, it looks and feels quality for the price without paying a huge amount for such a simple concept. I use an iPad air, an iPhone 6s, and an iPhone 7. Because I work from home, my work and personal electronics have to mix but stay organized. This holds them all."" — Rachel R Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in three colors and with or without USB ports). The shelves come in two separate parts that can be arranged close together or spread further apart, depending on what you need! Some reviewers even picked up several of these to build a bigger shelving unit on their desk [pictured above right]. Promising reviews: ""This organizer is a lifesaver . Made my desk less cluttered looking and works great!"" — Elizabeth ""Absolutely love this shelving. I’ve been working from home since the pandemic hit and I went from a huge office to a nook in the corner of our sitting room with no shelving or filing cabinets. The clutter on my desk was driving me nuts. Finally found what I was looking for: a place for my little knickknacks and pictures and my notepads/mail/important papers. Building it was pretty easy, although I did need to turn a piece around, but took less than 15 to put together. Makes my organizing heart happy."" — bdeleone Get them from Amazon for $25.99 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I sit at a desk all day and this saves my life every day at work ! All my co-workers ask to borrow it. The heat and the moving massage balls feel so amazing!

This compact, rolling desk bike is also height adjustable so you can get your perfect fit with the tray, and has ""whisper quiet"" pedaling, eight resistance levels, and a way to track your mileage, rpm, and other stats. Psst — you can watch the viral desk bike TikTok featuring it for more insight on how it works. Promising review: "" I honestly want to rip the seat off and put it on my own bicycle because of how comfortable it is . It's a plushy seat that adds tons of comfort and support. I LOVE how easy and self-explanatory the bike is, as well as PORTABLE. The wheels make it super easy to move. The desk is a dream come true — nice and spacious and I love the plushy armrest that sits along the edge. If I could give this product 100 STARS I would! For the amount of HOURS I am sitting down at a computer a day, this has been an absolute LIFESAVER and I highly recommend this to anyone wishing they could not only be more active, but who wishes to have better posture while working at their computer."" — Alexa Chalnick Get it from Amazon for $599.99 (available in six styles). Promising reviews: ""I love them! Super lightweight on my face and help so much with glare! I would get migraines all the time but these glasses are a lifesaver! "" — Allie Bouziga ""I honestly can't say enough great things about these glasses. They are cute and for an unbeatable price. The anti-glare isn't bad and they are thick and feel sturdy. Very comfortable to wear and definitely help during the day when you are sitting on the computer and want to give your eyes a rest. I used to get terrible headaches and dry eyes from sitting in front of the computer all day for long hours and this has significantly reduced that. I no longer get headaches as much and my eyes don't feel nearly as dry because I'm not straining them as much."" — Jessica Kravitz Get a set of two from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in 16 color combos).

I use it for carrying my ponytail holders, bobby pins, etc. in my purse. I totally heart it."" — Pudingal1 Get it from Amazon for $4.95 . You deal all the cards out to your two to four players, and everyone keeps their mini-deck facedown. Everyone takes a turn putting a card down in the middle of the table, saying one of the words ""taco,"" ""cat,"" ""goat,"" ""cheese,"" and ""pizza,"" in that order. If the picture on your card matches the word that's said, everyone slaps their hand on the card in a pile as quickly as possible. The last person on the pile has to take the stack and add 'em to their cards, and whoever runs out of cards first wins! Promising review: ""We love Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza original game , so I am so happy that now I can bring this with us to the beach! My kids have already put these in our pool and have been 'diving' for them. It's not exactly how you play the game at all, but they think it is fun! Also, the little outfits for the characters are adorable. I was skeptical about the travel clip at first, but the circle shape makes it much easier to get the cards on/off."" — Timothy M. Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Promising review: ""I didn't know what to expect from this super adorable anxiety bookshelf, but it delivered! I shake it up when I feel anxiety, even frustration, and I sort all the little books back onto the shelves any way I want, and it is sooo satisfying ! The bookshelf is super cute and well-built. It is sturdy and beautiful. The tiny books are detailed, and their covers are amazing. They aren't actual books, but they really look like they are. This is the most gratifying gift I have ever purchased for myself. Beyond satisfied! "" — Elda M Ferguson Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in brown or white). KAF Home is a small business!

The straps fit over your shoulder nicely so they are easy to carry."" — Susan Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in seven styles). Promising review : ""I was amazed how real this looks, even side by side with the real thing. Of course, when you turn it over, you can see the compartment, and you will have to add weight if you want it to feel real, but just sitting in the pantry, it looks real!"" — Brenda Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in nine styles). Promising review: ""Santa left this under the tree for my 9-year-old son, and he LOVES it! So easy to use and takes only a few tries to figure out the boomerang effect!

Lasts long enough to give you breaks!!"" — Kerri "" My teenager loved getting this as a stocking stuffer . It's easy to figure out, durable, and won't give anyone a concussion if you get hit with it.

Promising review: ""Never have I ever been obsessed with a lip balm until Summer Fridays. Love the color, love the applicator, love the scent!

Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in 10 flavors). Promising review: "" This item is the most convenient. It is perfect for someone who does not like to carry around a purse all the time.

It's great for layering or wearing on its own."" — Averie Get it from Amazon for $14.45 (available in white or yellow gold and nine styles)/ If you're wondering *how* these compare, the one on the left is similar to a diamond tennis bracelet (which you can nab from TONS of places), and the middle and right-hand ones bear a striking resemblance to Cartier's $8,000 ""Juste Un Clou"" and the $6,000 ""Love Bracelet."" Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bracelet set! The pieces are delicate yet sturdy, and they can be worn together or separately for different looks.

I'm sooo happy with this. It's a little tight on my finger but I just wear it a little higher where it isn't uncomfortable. It was very easy to set up for my Android device.

I've tried many (and I mean, MANY) water bottles in my time as a shopping editor and I may just go out on a limb here and say this is the best one. I adore my Stanley tumbler, and my BruMate is lovely, but this Owala bottle is such a game-changer. I love the 24-ounce size (not too big, not too small), and the dual spout is UNREAL. I barely know how to describe it except that it's a very smooth drinking experience, and the color options are so fun! I'm definitely a convert and will be using one of these, dare I say, for life. Promising review: ""I have six of them and absolutely LOVE them! The design is amazing, and the colors are stunning! I have recommended them to my friends and even gave some as presents.

Promising review: ""I also ordered one of those book lights that you have to clip directly onto your book. I haven't even tried the clip-on yet because I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH!! It's so versatile. It is the perfect solution for when I'm up in the middle of the night and I still want to stay in bed and read while my husband sleeps next to me. Even when I don't have to worry about disturbing someone, this light is still my go-to when reading. It's better than any nightstand lamp because you can focus this light directly on your book or other types of hands-on projects. I had worried that it would be uncomfortable around my neck ,but it's so lightweight I hardly even notice it."" — Linda Holloway Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in eight styles).

They are an affordable pair of pickleball paddles that I have used for almost a year. Having a pair of paddles makes it easy to play with friends and makes this set a great value for the price.

It smells absolutely divine and I can't wait to try out more of their scents. Promising review: ""Gorgeous scent! I love perfumes, and I’m super picky. I either love or return. This scent is gorgeous. Smells a bit sweet but not overly sweet, not super vanilla, just a hint of it with sophistication. Very soft and sultry. I applied moisturizer (thin, thin layer of Vaseline) and then sprayed perfume. It stayed on my skin for probably over eight hours. I checked my sweater the next day, you could easily smell it on my sweater. Definitely worth the money."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29+ (available in two sizes).

BuzzFeed Staff After the Karate Kid actor purportedly insisted that “he did not do anything wrong,” Alicia reportedly found an on-site officer who confirmed that she had a “noticeable bite mark on her arm that was already turning blue and bruising.” The officer reportedly questioned Martin after seeing the bite mark, after which the actor allegedly “admitted to biting” Alicia “out of jest.” The file alleges, “He thought he was being funny, and they play fight all the time on the set of Cobra Kai, and he did not think it was a big deal.” Alicia allegedly made it known that Martin “had legitimately caused her pain.” Reacting to the report online, several internet users were incredibly concerned for Alicia. “this is not okay like what???” one user replied to Variety’s tweet about the incident. “Everything about this is crazy,” another person said . “Martin Kove (Sensei Kreese) just completely destroyed and ruined his reputation,” one user tweeted . Someone else wrote on Reddit , “What a strange thing to do. ‘Play fight’? Like it would be one thing if they mimed karate moves at one another, since it's a fucking karate show, but actually biting someone? What the hell?”",2025-06-24T17:14:58.463455+00:00

Anything anyone threw at me. It was a difficult time. I needed rebooting.” BuzzFeed Staff After eight years of intense legal fighting, Brad and Angelina’s divorce battle finally concluded in late December last year. Discussing the need to “renovate” himself, he added: “You strip down to the foundation and break out the mortar… For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street.” The trio got into an honest conversation about what it’s like to join AA and talk honestly about your experiences when you’re someone as famous as Brad. Interestingly, the Oscar-winner called AA an “amazing thing” and said he felt “quite at ease” being vulnerable. Brad also said he had a similar “desperate” approach when talking to a therapist about his personal struggles, saying: “When I jumped into therapy then, I was just like, ‘Blah, blah, blah, and I did this and I did that and da da da da.’”",2025-06-24T17:14:58.613333+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff Before he was running the show behind the camera, Deepak Kumar Mishra was cracking everyone up online as the guy who nailed a spoof of Raghu Ram. Who would've thought the Rowdies guy would go on to make one of India’s most loved web series? Panchayat was originally going to be called SDO Saheb, because the story was based on a Sub-Divisional Officer. But since the Panchayat office kinda became the star of the show, they went with the much simpler—and catchier— Panchayat . Composer Anurag Saikia wanted something that felt emotional without actual words, so he made up lyrics inspired by Assamese chants for the track “Hiya Tho.” It sounds deep, but it’s actually just beautiful nonsense. And it works. Like his character, Jitendra is an IIT grad who left the corporate life to chase his passion. Thankfully, instead of running a Panchayat office, he landed in front of a camera. Before becoming Sachiv Ji, Jitendra Kumar faced a major blow when he was rejected by both the National School of Drama and FTII, despite his passion for acting and a diploma in engineering But that wasn't the only twist. At one point, he even considered switching lanes and entering rural politics before fully committing to his acting career. Talk about a plot twist worthy of Panchayat itself! Chandan Roy originally came in for a minor part. But he nailed his audition so hard that the makers were like “OK yeah, let’s make him central to the plot.” Enter Vikas, the MVP of quiet chaos. With over 28 million viewers (yep, you read that right), Panchayat season 3 became the second most-watched series in India in 2024, according to the Ormax Media Report. And guess what? It’s still chilling in the top 3. Not bad for a show where the biggest twist is usually someone stealing an election or a water tank. At the 2024 International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Panchayat was crowned Best Indian Web Series. For a show that’s kept things simple (and sincerely funny) since day one, this win isn’t just a pat on the back. It’s a huge moment for Indian OTT content finally getting the serious recognition it deserves. For Season 2, writer Chandan Kumar wanted the real inside scoop of how village panchayats actually function. So, he rang up a bunch of local leaders—inlcuding an ex-mukhiya from North Bihar. But instead of talking about governance or issues, the guy went off script and just trashed his opposition. Method research? More like live drama. Yep, before becoming Abhishek Tripathi, he spent time in Mahodiya village, chilling with local officials, soaking in the everyday chaos, and watching real panchayat meetings go down. No wonder he nailed the confused city guy–turned–reluctant secretary vibe so well. Those cozy Republic Day scenes in Panchayat Season 1? Total illusion. The cast was sweating it out in shawls and sweaters while filming in a brutal 45–47°C. There were no air conditioners, no fancy setups, just peak summer, and a lot of patience.",2025-06-24T17:14:58.938807+00:00

Intimate Rose is a small biz creating wellness products, like dilators, weights, supplements, and more that help treat issues and pain related to the pelvic floor. Promising review: ""Since starting, my bladder control has significantly improved. I am now able to sneeze or cough without peeing myself. Yes, that's right. I am able to hold my pee longer, which means I can actually make it to the bathroom without dribbling on myself. The best part is that just a few short weeks into the program you will have results you can feel. I think every woman who has ever had kids should try this out. The overall quality of my life has improved. Ditch your panty liners, stop the embarrassing dribbles, and no more mad dashes to the restroom because of a weak bladder. Even my sex life has improved; I have control of those pelvic muscles now. Just remember to wash the weights before and after each use with an antibacterial spray, and allow time to air dry before putting them away. I say air dry because if you wipe them dry with a cloth you run the risk of giving yourself a bladder infection or urinary tract infection, and those are no laughing matter.

Long story short, I got these medicated Band-Aids and the results are incredibly satisfying. Used these Band-Aids every day for a week and the next week, my wart is gone.

One cycle with this stuff, 15 minutes, and the results are amazing! The first photo (above) is with my tub running with the solution. Then I drained it (second photo) and wiped it down with a sponge.

The set includes five fabric pants button extenders, five fabric hook-and-eye extenders, and three denim jeans waist extenders in a variety of colors. Promising review: ""Why didn't I get these sooner? These work perfectly! You have all of those pants that used to fit great, until a few years ago — you know, the ones in the back of your closet that you will wear again 'as soon as you lose a few pounds.' These extenders look simple enough but you think that they won't work or will show. The good news is, they never show once you put your belt on and, in my case, I've now got five pairs of chinos, three pairs of dress wool pants, and three pair of jeans now back into my rotation! Buy these!"" — JCI Get a multipack from Amazon for $7.99 . If you suspect you have tonsil stones (also called tonsilloliths), talk to your dentist or doctor so they can perform a physical exam or imaging scan and deliver a diagnosis. Promising review: ""I'm in my early 30s and just started getting tonsil stones. Until a few months ago, I never even knew what these things were! Anyway, I've been struggling with cotton buds to fully remove the stones, but I couldn't get rid of them, and they would just come back within the week. I received this and OMFG...best investment ever. No struggle holding my phone as a flashlight while awkwardly poking myself in front of my badly lit bathroom mirror. I sat comfortably at my vanity, used one hand, and removed the whole stone in less than a minute. Why did I not know this was a thing? Why have I been struggling? Get it! Stop struggling, suffering, and awkwardly dealing with this ridiculous condition...trust me."" — Wren Get it from Amazon for $8.94+ (available in two colors and a multipack).

I love giving them as gifts!!!"" — AML Get it from Amazon for $4.97+ (available in six sizes). Promising review: ""I am one of those women who just hates those thick pads. I tried others that claimed good protection but found out very soon that they leaked. I want to know that I am protected from embarrassing situations. I am an older woman with urinary incontinence. It's bad enough being old and having all the problems old people go through, but add urine leakage and bad urine odor, and you see others turn away from you. These pads are exactly what I like. They are thin and fit comfortably, and you don't smell like you got a diaper on; no leaks and no discomfort.

Community Contributor She came in cool, confident, and immediately had guys second-guessing their connections. She was the kind of bombshell who changed the vibe just by being there. Kat didn’t cause drama on purpose, but her entrance had the villa’s energy shifting instantly. She gave sweet bombshell energy, but left everyone questioning their ""secure"" couples. Kenny's impact was instant: one look at Jana and she already saw her whole future ahead of her. No scheming, just pure bombshell charm. Isaiah reminded us that male bombshells can bring the drama too. His entrance had triangles forming and loyalties tested in minutes. He was never there to play it safe! Mercedes gave us textbook iconic bombshell behavior. His chemistry with each islander detonated the most shocking recoupling of the season, IYKYK. Grace didn’t just enter; she owned the villa from the second she stepped in. Nobody was safe once Grace arrived, and the shake-up was immediate. Maura redefined bombshell energy. From bold moves to fierce one-liners , she kept the villa (and us) on our toes 24/7. She bombshelled so hard that the producers made her the host of Love Island Games . Our newest bombshell on the list is Andreina. She came in wanting to stir the pot, and I have a feeling that is exactly what she will do... Okay, yes, I know Zeta may have been an OG, but she radiated bombshell energy. She commanded the villa with grace, emotional intelligence, and star power. Miguel was the bombshell blueprint. Charismatic, funny, and dangerously good at making connections, Miguel had couples crumbling within hours. The villa reset the moment he arrived. He's set the standard for male bombshells that's yet to be matched.",2025-06-24T17:14:59.504757+00:00

Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Some even call these steam cleaners the best purchase they've ever made. Contributor, HuffPost Using steam also allows you to clean with just water, a gentler alternative to harsh chemical cleaners . Steam cleaning can work on tons of surfaces, from tile to stoves, windows and even sealed hardwood floors. Rating: 4.2 out of 5 stars We've previously covered this Steamify handheld option, and our readers have responded with enthusiasm. The steamer can heat up to 230 degrees in three to five minutes and has a 350-milliliter tank, able to produce continuous pressurized steam for seven to 15 minutes. The 12-piece accsesory kit includes a few different nozzles for cleaning windows, doors, corners and even steaming fabric. There's a 9.8-foot power cord. Promising review: ""I recently purchased this steam cleaner for my bathroom, and I’m beyond impressed. It’s incredibly durable, with a sturdy build that feels like it will last for years. The steam output is powerful and consistent, making deep cleaning effortless. It’s also a huge time-saver, cutting my cleaning time in half. I’ve had no issues with leakage, and the speed at which it heats up and gets the job done is outstanding. Overall, it’s an excellent investment for anyone looking for efficiency and reliability in their cleaning routine."" — Rokan Price: $55.89 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars Shark's Steam & Scrub mop is set apart by its rotating pads and and focused “steam blaster” spray, which work together to provide powerful steam and 150 scrubs per minute to remove stains. The mop has three steam modes for different mess levels, a touch-button operation and LED headlights so you can see and tackle all of the dirt and debris. Promising review: ""This product is truly a god send. I have referred so many people to this product just by word of mouth. I can have my entire house mopped within 15 minutes and I have a total of 4 pads that are machine washable (game changer). When I was pregnant, I was able to still mop with ease, submitting little to no effort. If you have a little (or a messy spouse) this is your sign- you NEED."" — Katie N Price: $199.95 Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars With 4.3 stars across over 42,000 reviews, McCulloch's deluxe canister steam cleaner has a two-hour runtime and a 64-ounce tank. The 18-foot power cord, 7-foot hose, wheels and retractable handle make it easy to move the tank around as needed. In addition to flooring, tile, grills and more, the steamer is great for personal car detailing, with tons of brushes, a scraper, mop pads and a squeegee. If you're looking for a more heavy-duty option, this could be the one for you. Promising review: ""Put off buying one of these for a while (2-3 yrs). I’m glad I finally but the bullet!! This is awesome! Took me 15 minutes to deep clean my stove, normally can take well over 45 minutes due to me completing taking it apart. Also got ALL the hard water stains off my windows in minutes WITHOUT me scrubbing! I normally have to get an SOS pad and vinegar. NOT THIS TIME! 3 swipes and I was done with a 4’ x 6’ window! Cord is about as long as a normal vacuum so it doesn’t bother me at all."" — Coral M. Watkins Price: $192 Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars If you like the look and quality of that McCulloch steamer but don't need something so large or with so many accessories, the handheld version of their steam cleaner could be a good alternative. The steamer is much smaller, with just a 6-ounce tank that can run for up to 10 minutes at a time, but there are plenty of other features to like: The handle has a lockable trigger, plus there's a 34-inch extension hose and 10 other accessories like brushes, nozzles and more. The power cord is 15 feet, so you can get into hard-to-reach spots. Promising review: ""We have a 1960s model stove. I've been battling these stains on here for over 14yrs. I've tried every spray and scrubber known to man. I finally decided to purchase this and see what happens. I could cry y'all. She almost looks like new again. I'm so happy with how well it worked."" — Ashley m Price: $66.90 Rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars A rectangular mop head can pose a challenge when it comes to small spaces or unique layouts. That's not an issue with this Steam & Go mop , which has a triangular pointed head to eliminate that issue. The mop has a 10-in-1 design and a detachable handle, so you can use it as a handheld too, with different nozzles, pads and brushes. This steam mop can also be used with cleaning solution if you desire, unlike many others — there's a dual tank system to separate water and cleaning solution. Promising review: ""The floor in my apartment is vinyl with grooves in it which makes it very hard to clean. This steamer works perfectly and best of all it can be hand held. It has a number of attachments, an extra cleaning pad and a longer cord. I like the triangular head for getting into corners."" — Kathleen B. Price: $79.99 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars This steam mop heats up to 230 degrees and is a ""game-changer"" that has one reviewer 's floors ""living their best life."" There are three levels of adjustable steam, so you can get the right amount of power for your cleaning need or floor type. The tank holds 15.2 ounces and the power cord is 23 feet long. This mop has a self-standing design for easy storage, and an adjustable height so you won't strain your back or shoulders when using it. Promising review: ""So far, I am very pleased with my steamer. I have all tile floors, and it works like a dream on them. The steamer is very light weight, heats in no time, slides nicely over the tiles, even the porcelain ones that have a little rougher surface. It sure beats sleping a bucket and mop around and it saves my shoulders from aching afterwards."" — M. Allen Price: $89.99 Rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars Another option with a triangular mop head, this 5-in-1 steam mop can be used as a handheld or standing up. The 400-milliliter tank has four modes and can be heated up in as little as 30 seconds. This comes with 11 accessories, including a few cleaning cloths, window cleaning tools, brushes and nozzles. Promising review: ""This is one of the most amazing tools I have ever used. It was extremely well packaged and arrived in perfect condition. Quality components, especially power cord (which is nice and long) and attachments. Super light weight. I could not believe the cleaning power. I started with the grout in my bathroom and was instantly impressed. Continued to the shower where it got mildew from cracks and crevasses with almost zero effort, even the plastic track piece that holds the shower doors at the bottom. It got the space behind my toilet that I can never reach because there is so little room. Used it on the seal of my front loader washing machine and it immediately got rid of the musty smell. Used it on my sink drains and it got rid of the odor there. I am so over the top happy with this product. Highly recommend."" — alisha mckenzie Price: $169.95 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars Multiple reviews call this Waitbird steamer a ""workhorse"" with ""outstanding cleaning power."" It can heat up to 248 degrees and comes with a whopping 21 accessories for multiple uses. The 38-ounce tank provides up to 45 minutes of continuous steam and only takes five minutes to heat up. You can adjust the amount of steam and also toggle between manual and automatic mode to control the steam flow. Promising review: ""The best purchase I made ever! We moved into our house 2 years ago and have cleaned it pretty well but we have never DEEP clean it like how this steamer did. It was was so easy to use and removed the toughest build up. And a bonus is it is very easy to store away as well. We love it and recommend it to all homeowners!"" — Todd Tolley Price: $99.99+ (available in two colors) Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars This mop has 10 accessories and a 10-ounce water tank, plus a 23-foot cord. Multiple reviews mention that the value is great for the price you pay . The head can rotate 120 degrees left to right, and 90 degrees front to back to get into tough spots, and the three cleaning modes can help you tackle daily cleaning as well as more stubborn stains. Promising review: ""I just love this steam mop!! I used it to clean the tile floor in my bathroom. It has cleaned the floor with out me having to do spot cleaning manually. It is so quick to clean. No going over it several times to get great results. I will be using this steam mop everywhere. It cut down on my cleaning time greatly. There is a sense of cleaest it can be now when I enter in the room not the best I could do."" — Sandra Robinson Price: $89.99 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars This canister cleaner can hold 48 ounces of water at a time for up to 45 minutes of continuous steam, though the lockable trigger helps you conserve water so it's directed where and when you need it. The 15-foot power cord and 6.5-foot hose give this thing serious reach, and the 15 accessories include handy attachments like mop pads, brushes, a squeegee and more for different cleaning needs. A bunch of reviewers were inspired to leave this machine long , multi-paragraph 5-star reviews , in case that tells you how beloved this is. Promising review: ""This unit puts out HOT steam. I've tried another steamer and found the steam to not be nearly as hot as this one. I have steamed tile, wood floors, base boards and cabinets with this machine and have been very pleased with the results. It has a trigger on the wand/nozzle which is extremely useful. I had another steamer where the only control was on the water unit, not the nozzle, which was really a pain. Lots of attachments that reach up high - handy for tile walls in the shower. I've been steaming everything that doesn't run away from me! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."" — DH Price: $119.99 Rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars Another large canister option, this steamer can hold 51 ounces of water and even has a red LED light to let you know when it needs a refill (which will typically be about 30 to 45 minutes after you turn it on). Reviews vouch for its effectiveness in killing bed bugs and insects as well as steaming fabric and whole-house cleaning, earning it ""10 stars"" in one reviewer's estimation . This one also has a child safety lock, if you're concerned about a little one getting near it. It heats up to 226 degrees and has 19 accessories, including two extension tubes for the 10-foot cord. Promising review: ""This is,an excellent steam cleaner! I would recommend this over the lower priced ($30 to $40) range cleaners and the high priced ones that cost a few hundred dollars. This steam cleaner has a large container so it creates steam for more than 45 minutes. The steam is very hot and powerful so it makes cleaning a snap. I especially loved the metal scrub brushes- they got rid of all the sticky stuff on my kitchen gas hood (that no chemical cleaner could even budge) and the tile floor. I hope they sell those as extras. I love everything about this little machine and not to mention that it is safe, effective, efficient and performs better than any chemical cleaner. Also saves a lit of time, money and manpower and makes everything smell super clean. Last but not least it cleans everything well - windows, stainless steel appliances, tile, ceramic, shower, toilets and bathtubs."" — Ak2474 Price: $107.98+ (available in three colors) Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:14:59.677830+00:00

Promising review: ""I pretty much love everything about this romper. I ordered the dark green, but I want it in every color! It is super comfortable. Even right out of the package, it wasn't very wrinkled. The material wasn't too thick or thin. I wore it in summer with sandals, but I think you could easily add a sweater/tights/boots for a cute fall look. It was easy to get on/off in the bathroom (one small button at the back of the neck)... And, best of all, it has pockets!!!"" — Jessica K. Price: $23.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and 17 colors) Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bracelet set! The pieces are delicate yet sturdy, and they can be worn together or separately for different looks. The design is simple but elegant, making it perfect for both casual and formal occasions. They’re also really comfortable to wear all day. Definitely worth the price!"" — Brandy Gay Price : $18.99 for a set of three (also available in sets of two) Promising review : ""I normally don’t love lip products. I have small lips and I am never really satisfied! But this stuff is sooooo good! You don’t even understand how moisturizing and glossy this is. It’s not sticky, very pigmented, and the stain it leaves behind is gorgeous! I got the Rosie one, and it's chef's kiss perfect! I’m totally getting more!"" — Katherine Stanton Price: $11.97 (available in 12 shades) Promising review: ""The hype off TikTok is real about this scent. It’s very warm and vanilla-smelling. Almost like a beachy vibe. I hate how no one would give me any kind of explanation on how it smelled, but glad I jumped on the bandwagon with this one."" — Karli Bullins Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in 11 other scents). It even comes with eight extra brush heads AND a travel case! Promising review: ""I'm now at over three years with this toothbrush and it still looks and works like new. I use it in the shower, rinse it under water after every use, and use it two to three times a day. The only thing that is maybe suffering at this point is the battery (lasts about 1.5 weeks now), but I also only charge it when the red charging light comes on. If you leave it on the charger stand daily, this may never be an issue for you. This is truly a great product for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone. I had originally felt that if it lasted as long as my Sonicare, it would save me some money, but at this point, it has surpassed my Sonicare by 2+ years for a fraction of the price! "" — Jesse Price: $39.95 Promising review: ""Very glam in a '50s starlet way, a real bikini feel without being super exposed. I hate swimsuits, and this is the first one I've worn in about 10 years. I felt confident in it and really enjoyed myself at the weekend getaway. The little cutout makes it sexy to wear with a sarong or wrap for when you need to take a break from the poolside."" — Ms. Willows Price : $36.99+ (available in sizes XS–22 Plus, and 27 colors). Reviewers mention that if you're between sizes, size up! Promising review: ""This suit is so pretty! I was nervous that for the price, it would be poor quality, but it looks just like the photos. The material is nice and thick, and I love that it’s padded. I’m between a small and medium, so I sized up based on other reviews."" — Morgan Meldrum Price : $35.99 (available in sizes 2–14 and in eight styles). Promising review: ""This product is witchcraft. My nails have always been brittle, flaky, and super prone to just breaking. Because of all that, I had the nasty habit of biting them. I didn’t take before or after but the image with no polish is just three days of use. My nails have been growing like [wild] since then and are stronger than ever in my life. The image with polish is about a month of use (once a day). Also, it helped me to stop biting my nails. I can now do my own nails and shape them the way I want. Never in my life did I think I’d have nails I could shape myself. I don’t leave a lot of reviews, but trust me when I say this product is worth the hype. I’m definitely a returning customer."" — Andrea Price: $9.99+ (available in three sizes and packs of two). This travel tumbler is insulated — so your hot or cold drinks will actually stay that way for hours! Promising review : ""I bought the 12-ounce, and let me tell you! This is by far the best travel mug I’ve EVER bought. Super leakproof (and I shove it into my tote bag and duffel bag). Super durable. Great material, and the sip? Super smooth. No slurping because it allows air to flow out and in while drinking . Such a great mug. Worth every damn penny. Highly recommend. P.S. — hot stuff stays super hot for a long time."" — Lindsay Panataleon Price: $24.98+ (available in two sizes and seven colors) Promising review: "" I purchased these originally in May 2020, and I finally bought a second pair in April 2022. I chose these two years ago to help with the foot/knee/back pain I was having while walking on the hard concrete floors of my lab. They soon became my all-day, everyday shoes: at work, at home, and outside. The fabric upper is slightly stretchy, making it feel like the shoe is hugging your foot without binding. I have a large bunio,n and these are the only shoes I’ve worn that don’t put pressure on it or have a seam in that area that causes pain. These sneakers have been through hundreds of hours of walking, along with yard work and hiking. I have machine-washed them countless times (not recently, lol), and they’ve held up without fraying or shrinking. The fabric comes completely clean from the red clay we have here in the south, along with stains from oil and chicken poop (don’t ask)."" — Lauren C Price: $36.48+ (available in sizes women's 5–13, in two widths, and 10 colors). Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products. This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (seriously where was this on my last hiking trip?) Promising review: ""I bought this because I saw it on TikTok, and have been having issues with mosquito bites. Used it a few times to relieve itchiness and I am convinced it works! Have been recommending it to my family and friends. Read the directions and follow them carefully. Don't use this on your face or neck, or other sensitive areas. Don't do a lot of suction, just a little bit. And do it a few times if needed. Great invention!"" — Joe Price : $9.95 (available in three colors). Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" — Tracey Agopian Price : $9.99 . The shade Cheers to No Smears is featured above on the left, and the shade Fast Foodie is featured on the right. Promising review : ""I just love this nail polish! Love the color and how fast it dries. I will order again."" — Georgie Price: $9.99 (available in 31 shades) Promising review: ""I have a pair of the Aerie crossover flare leggings, and those are worn out, so I decided to purchase another pair because I can’t live without my flares! Y'all, these leggings are the truth!! I have never seen such a great [alternative] for the Aerie ones. They feel like butter soft on your skin and have the same durability and thickness, even the same stitching!! Save your money and get these!!!"" — Jasmine Price : $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XXL, four inseams, and in 27 colors) This set also comes with plastic gloves, a plastic cover, and rubber bands. Promising review: "" Bought these as an activity for teenagers. Dye color is vibrant and beautiful. We first made the designs using the provided directions and rubber bands, then dry dyed the shirts. We left the shirts in bags for 24 hrs and then washed them outside with a hose to not get the ink/dye all over. We then let the shirts dry outside in the sun, then we rinsed and dried them in the washer, then washed and dried them again. Color has stayed beautifully, and kids love the shirts!"" — Ariss M Price: $24.74 Reviewer on the left is wearing the shade Pink Ice , reviewer on the right is wearing the shade Mink Brown . Promising review: ""I bought a couple of these lipsticks some time ago, and I was expecting nothing from them, and they delivered a lot. These lipsticks are very pigmented and creamy. One application will last several hours. They are moisturizing, and they look great on your lips."" — Yise Price: $1.29 (available in 23 shades) Promising review: "" As someone who owns multiple pairs of Birks, these sandals are absolutely up to the expectations of real Birks! The Birks I have are the Arizona soft footbed. I wanted this style of Birks, but I couldn’t find the soft footbed version in them. I saw these and thought I might as well try them for the price. Let me tell you, these are even comfier than my soft-footbed Arizona Birks! Omg, they feel amazing. They are nice and padded! They are so adorable, too! Great quality."" — Lee Price: $29.99 (available in women's sizes 5–12, two widths, and 20 colors) Promising review: "" I recently tried this bra, and it has quickly become one of my favorites! The fit is perfect — true to size with just the right amount of stretch to ensure comfort all day. The straps are adjustable and don’t dig in, even after wearing them for hours. The fabric is soft against the skin, and the breathability is great, so I never feel overheated. The support is amazing without feeling too constrictive. It gives a natural lift and keeps everything in place without any uncomfortable digging or shifting. I also love the design; it's sleek and subtle, making it perfect to wear under a variety of outfits."" — Tzippy M Price: $16.94+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 19 colors) Promising review: ""After trying a bunch of different sports bras and tops, I came across this one . I absolutely love it. It’s super supportive and comfortable. The adjustable straps help make this the perfect fit."" — Perrone Price : $28 (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and seven colors) You can also spray it on all over if you need some quick head-to-toe moisture when you're in a hurry. Promising review: ""I wish I could rate this 100 stars. This stuff is INCREDIBLE... My skin instantly looks and feels hydrated, fresh, glowing, and comfortable. I am already on my third bottle of this; it is wonderful to incorporate into skincare as a first step, in between other products, as a setting/finishing spray for makeup, or throughout the day when your skin needs a little refresher. I wish they'd make a jumbo size of this (like, 10+ oz), because I would douse my entire body in this formula if I could."" — bex–7 Price: $14+ (available in two sizes and a two-pack) Promising review: ""Absolutely have become my favorite pair of sunglasses, and I have many pairs. Very trendy and quite affordable. I am shocked at how durable they are for the price point. My sunglasses take a beating on my head, thrown in my bag, and I usually break them in no time, but these have stood up to my normal wear. They offer solid sun protection but not super dark, which I love. They fit the face very well, not oversized and huge, but just right for me. Love them!"" — NittanyLion Price: $15.99 (available in 10 colors) Promising review: "" Product works just as described! Our kiddos are 3 and 1, and both love to use it. We love that the pen can be attached and that we can lock the screen if we want to. Perfect for at home, car travel, and when we need the kids quiet and entertained."" — Sean C Price: $19.99+ (available in three sizes and five colors) Promising review: ""I'm purchasing my third and fourth sets of these sheets today. One will be a gift for my mom and dad. Over a year later, I've had no issues at all. They continue to wash and fit perfectly and are easily adaptable for weather changes. I add a flannel top sheet or blanket when chilly. Can't be beat for under $20 a set."" — nativepeach Price: $12.99+ (available in seven sizes and 44 colors and patterns) Promising review: "" When I first saw the advertisement for this product, I thought it was too good to be true, so I purchased it to see if it truly worked, and it absolutely did... I have 4c hair and everything I have ever used never worked — my hair would get frizzy or even go back to curly as soon as I stepped outside. I had no frizz, no static, and my hair was SO SOFT and it lasted a week and a half. I LOVE this product."" — Chy Marie Price: $12+ (available in two sizes and two kits) It's also available in an extra strength version and a version for curly hair . If you're looking for a water-based cleanser to go with this one, reviewers love this pore-deep cleansing foam from the same brand for their double-cleansing routine! Promising review: ""My skin is *super* sensitive, but as I've aged (44 years), I feel like my pores have become more visible. I hadn't used an oil cleanser before and wasn't 100% sure how it should all work. The Anua oil cleanser works how we all once hoped Biore pore strips would work back in the day but without any pain or irritation. My skin is combination skin, so I have to be really careful about not drying out the dry spots (and getting eczema) and not over-hydrating the oily spots (and getting a breakout). I rub the oil on my face as the first part of my cleansing routine; I massage it in for ~60 seconds and then put a small amount of water on my fingers and begin rubbing that on my face. The water starts the emulsification process and helps to clean out everything the oil has bonded to/mixed with. Then, I just rinse it clean and use a gentle cleanser afterward. I haven't had any irritation, redness, or fallout from adding this product to my skincare routine. I love it. I am almost through my first bottle and if I go a few days without using the cleanser, my pores become more visible/dirty again. I will definitely keep purchasing the Anua oil cleanser."" — Tassa Price: $17.69 Check out a TikTok of the Monday Dry Shampoo in action. Promising review: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months. It does have a white cast, but that can easily be worked into the hair to become undetectable."" — Meg B. Price : $6.97 Promising review: ""I’ve tried so many nipple covers over the years, and these are just in a league of their own! They stick and don’t move (sweat, clothes, moisturizer, etc. — nothing budges them), but then they peel off so easily. It’s magic. They are completely seamless, and my husband (without prompting) said they looked like a second skin. I’ve got quite 'triangular' boobs, and they completely mold to the shape and look like I just have no nipples lol. Only when I’m suuuuuper cold does any level of nipple start to show through, and even then, it’s minimal. They’re more pricey than others I’ve bought before but so worth it. The others were one and done — these have held up through several wears and are still in perfect condition. Will repurchase them as soon as they wear out, without a doubt! No more bras! "" — Alison BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Price: $26.50+ (available in five shades and two sizes: one that fits cups A–C and one that fits cups D+).

I copied his grandparents' great idea and got one for my grandson and he is equally captivated by it! Get an extra gallon of bubbles to send with it if it is a gift!"" — One Concerned Prof Price : $24.99 Promising review: ""I bought this for all the clear bag ruled events. It worked great to carry all things I deemed necessary: wallet, glasses case, phone, keys, and tissue pack. The price was fair and I liked having a choice of colors. The strap was adjustable for cross body or over the shoulder."" — yosews Price : $7.99+ (available in 20 colors) Psst — lots of reviewers say this fits their Stanley cup *and* the cheaper alternative versions of it, like this $29 Simple Modern tumbler . Promising review : ""Easy to clean. Holds a lot of different snacks. Lightweight. Color is beautiful. Fun to use. Good gift idea."" — Mc Price : $9.99 (available in two sizes and five colors). Promising review: ""Where has this been all my life!! We have one long-haired cat and three dogs — suffice it to say, shedding hair is a big problem on every cloth-like surface in our home. No more vacuuming the couches and chairs like wild when you have this around. This picks up hair quickly and easily when used correctly (fast back-and-forth motion). I will never not have this in our house! "" — Shelby Cipolla Price : $23.99+ (available in three colors). Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic . Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic , you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" — Angela Leonard Price : $11.97. Promising review: ""I am totally obsessed with these lights. I bought my first set and had them for about a week and couldn’t get over how lovely they were. So, I have now purchased two more sets. They light up my flowers and azalea bushes beautifully. They have a lovely orange glow like little fireflies."" — A Lombardo Price: $14.98 (available as a four-, six-, or 10-pack) Promising review: "" I needed to upgrade my summer bag, and I am so glad I came across this one. I was really surprised at how large it was once it arrived. I got the large size, but I think it will work out perfectly. We tested it out on our picnic last weekend and it fit literally EVERYTHING. I was amazed. It fit TWO blankets on top, two lunches, two wine coolers, a wine bottle, a Yeti, snacks, and our books. At first, the price was a shock for me, but after seeing reviews and doing research, it is actually on the cheaper end, and for the quality, it is 100% worth it... Bonus points for the waterproof pocket for phones, keys, etc..."" — Amazon Customer Price: $41.99+ (available in three sizes and 21 colors) It works by plugging into your car's round auxiliary power outlet, so you can literally use it anywhere (I have a similar one and absolutely love it)! Promising review: ""Words cannot describe how much I hate dealing with gas stations — whether it's getting gas, a car wash, or air for my tires, I really hate being at the gas station for any length of time. I live in the Pittsburgh area, so the up-and-down weather wreaks havoc on my tire pressure and I am TRULY GRATEFUL to be able to check my tire pressure and fill them up from the comfort of my home. This device couldn't be easier to use, and the fact that you can lock the nozzle in place and fill the air hands-free is wonderful. I never leave reviews, but chef's kiss on this product. Can't recommend enough."" — Amazon Customer Price: $31.98+ (available in two sizes and four colors) Check out a TikTok of the plug-in fly trap in action. Promising review: ""I can’t say enough wonderful things about these handy little bug catchers! They are simple to use, cheap to refill, and catch a ton of small bugs and flies. I have eight of them now, all around my house! It’s a little gross how many tiny flying insects are around…but it makes me feel a lot better now that I have these!"" — Chris H. Price : $14.97 (available in different pack sizes). I ADORE my Nex Playground. Not only is it great for toddlers (my nieces and nephews spend hours playing little education games), but it's also so fun for adults. There's this Barbie Dance game that I am not ashamed to say I've spent literal hours playing with my husband, mother, and even three year old niece. It's crazy great at tracking people and movements. I only use the remote to turn on the game, but from there all I need to do is use my hand to choose options and start the games. It doesn't matter how tall or tiny the players are, the Nex camera is able to track your movements accurately so adults and children can play alike. Promising review : ""First, as a UX and graphic designer, I love the design of everything about the Nex Playground . Opening it was easy, and setup was understandable and easy for anyone. The onboarding was fun and creative. I wish there were more games in the catalog, but the games available were definitely worth the buy. This is great for apartment living and during the cold winter when your toddlers can't go outside; it solves many sensory issues. Keeping my kids active and keeping me in shape at the same time with a variety of creative activity games is amazing, and it makes for great family game nights. If you are looking for something fun for your kids that keeps them active, this is the buy for you. As a father of two toddlers with autism, I can honestly say this brings me back to when I had an Xbox Connect as a kid and I am happy my kids will be able to experience what I experienced. Looks good with my other systems."" — louis Price : $249 . Promising review: ""After trying these, the pursuit for the most seamless underwear ended with these, and I came to write that on my way to buy a second pack. I worked at VS for three years, what seems like forever ago, and tried every “seamless” thong under the sun- at the store and otherwise- all of which rolled, were still visible, or the liner was not cotton, which just feels gross by the end of a workout or the end of the day. These aren’t that. They DISAPPEAR under all the workout attire. Anti-camel toe… HELLO?!?! They don’t hold sweat. They don’t roll. They don’t move around.  I just had my fourth baby and first C-section a couple of months back, and these are wide enough in the front. What is this panty sorcery? I threw out everything else from anywhere else. Follow the size guide. I washed in warm water upon arrival, even with the red in the pack, and none of the colors bled. I’ve washed 2x, and they look the same as when I first opened the box. They’re wildly comfortable for a thong from someone who despises every thong and even other styles of underwear I’ve ever tried. Picky lady problems, the list went on. Always something wrong with them on my body. NOT THESE! What!?!! I work out in these, run errands, housework ahhhh — they’re my new go-to that I ditched everything else. Comfy, sexy, stretchy, actually so seamless that they don’t exist under clothing, and a fantastic deal… It’s sorcery, I’m convinced ."" — Ebony Price : $24+ (available in women's sizes XS–4X and nine color packs). County Line Kitchen is a small business specializing in mason jar–style cold brew makers, pitchers, and accessories. Promising review: ""This has been a hit in my house. Makes the most delicious cold brew and is of great quality. Has saved a ton of money on going out and on pods I used to buy. I try to let it sit for 48 hours so I can dilute it with a little water to get it to last longer, and throw it in my dishwasher in between uses. Perfect!"" — Jo Price : $24.99+ (available in two sizes and four styles). See what BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has to say about these : TBH, I bought this ring after seeing it blow up on TikTok, and I love it. I wear it every single day, and I've gotten SO many compliments on it — friends are always stunned when I tell them how cheap it is! I've been wearing it for months now without any wear and tear that a quick cleaning won't fix. Pictures don't do it justice; it really does ✨gleam✨ like real jewels. (Bonus: I use this as a fake wedding ring when I travel to encourage humans to leave me alone, lolololol.) Price : $15.95+ (available in three plates and sizes 5–10).

It's been YEARS since I've been able to find a swimsuit that I feel comfortable in. I love how beautiful it is while still being modest. It's very nicely made and very comfortable to wear.

Seems like it's really well made! Also, this braided rope detail is everything! I paired it with different bottoms I had because I wanted a tad more coverage (mom life), but the bottoms it came with were also cute and not too skimpy at all.

Tompkins Get it from Amazon for $26.99 (available in sizes S–XXL and 30 colors). Promising review : ""These shorts are amazing. I thought they would be like similar ones I've had that are short and you have to pull them down from riding up every few steps you take. They are so soft and comfortable, I wanted to wear them around the home, just as shorts. They are nice-fitting, tight, but not too snug to give you any bulges. They are also short, but a nice length, so it isn't riding up anywhere, and I don't feel like every few feet I'd walk, I'd have to pull them down. I'm seriously considering buying another pair in another color because they are so nice. Definitely worth it."" — Jenny P. Get it from Amazon for $21.98+ (available in sizes S–3XL and 10 colors). Many reviewers recommend sizing up! Promising review: ""I'm a size 10 and have a 36DD bust. I normally feel really self-conscious in a two-piece, but I was looking for something I felt good in that would also be different than the typical mom suit. I wanted it for a trip to the Dominican with my husband. I bit the bullet and went for this after reading so many reviews. Let me just say, I am so glad I did. I love this suit so much that I’m gonna order another one in a different color. I felt cute, sexy, and confident in it. I normally wear a size large or sometimes a medium, and I followed the sizing tips and other reviews and ordered a 2XL. It fits perfectly. I love it."" — Kristina Suko Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in sizes S–5XL and eight styles). Promising review : ""I LOVE this swimsuit. It is super cute if you want to feel sexy but are looking for a little more coverage. I purchased a couple of these for a work trip so that I would feel comfortable in front of our leadership team. I'm not a large person but I have very curvy hips and size D/DD boobs, and I felt most comfortable in the XL. Since I have larger hips, I found the M and L to be a little too tight around the waist/hip area. The adjustable ties in the back and on the shoulder straps made it easy to fit the XL to the rest of my body without feeling suffocated around the hip area. I have a lot of trouble with bathing suits because of my hips and often times I have to size up for this reason but it doesn't always work because the suit ends up being to big everywhere else and sagging in the butt area. This suit is perfect — if you are curvy like me, go for it and just size up! You won't be disappointed, and what's not to love about all the fun colors it comes in?"" — Mallory Dunphy Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in sizes S–XL and 25 colors). Promising review: ""A staple. This swimsuit is so nice. The quality is amazing, and it fits like a glove. Do it."" — Arianna Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in sizes 12–28 and 25 colors). Promising review: ""I was a little skeptical about ordering this swimsuit because I have a pretty large chest and was worried about looking droopy in this top. I am so surprised how well this fit and it is my new favorite swimsuit. It’s got a very wide band and good back coverage. Absolutely love it! The bottoms are great too, double layer, fairly cheeky and hit me in just the right places!"" — Amanda Get it from Amazon for $31.19 (available in sizes XS–XL and five styles). Promising review: ""Love this swim dress. The top is perfect, I'm a busty girl and its *chefs kiss. The bikini bottoms are cute, the top/skirt fully covers my bum so you don't really see the bikini bottoms but I feel comfortable to wear this around from the beach to lunch."" — Shawna Get them from Simka Sol for $125 (available in sizes XS–3X). Promising reviews: ""I was wowed from the beginning with this suit! It is beautifully packed with care. I was so impressed when I tried it on. The material is smooth and feels nice. It is unique and I am very pleased and am happy that I took a risk and went with a designer that I am not familiar with."" — Stephchil ""I have been searching for a one piece for months now and everything has had something wrong with it. This suit is comfortable and the reversible print is stunning. It looks like it cost more than it did. It truly is reversible, there is no show of the other side when you flip it. I could have gone a size smaller but I’m still satisfied. I am a big fan and will be shopping Jessie Zhao more now!"" — Ariane Get it from Nordstrom for $139 (available in sizes S–XXL).

BuzzFeed Contributor Promising review: ""I bought this after discovering that my ingrown leg hairs weren't actually ingrown hairs, but KP. This product was very well reviewed, and although I avoid gritty scrubs because of my sensitive skin, I thought I'd give it a try. Wow. I haven't even finished the first tube, and I'm seeing some amazing results just using it twice a week. I am very impressed. This stuff really works. So happy to have beach-ready legs this summer!"" — Ghanimatrix Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes and three scents). Promising review: ""This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you, thank you, thank you! Sincerely, all the grateful ta-tas you've helped to care for"" — Niko Get a three-pack from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes M–XXL and a variety of color combinations). Promising review: ""Very pleased with this purchase. Product is working on my sensitive teeth with no issues. Better results than Crest Whitestrips. Would and have recommended to others."" — Mel Get a two-pack from Amazon for $18.95 (also available in packs of one and four). Oh! BTW this stuff is reaaaally STRONG, so make sure you do a spot test first — especially if you have sensitive skin! Check out this review on TikTok ! Promising reviews: ""I saw this product on TikTok and I decided to give it a shot since it was only like $20 for 10 wipes (that's 10 weeks, 2.5 months) of no underarm sweat. It worked! I was so happy to finally be able to wear all the shirts I own that are not black! I only apply it every week, and all week long, there is NO sweat under my arms! This is amazing!"" — Nes172011 Get 10 wipes from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in packs of 20 and 30). For more info on how to use acupressure for nausea management, check out this guide from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . Promising review: ""I have always suffered from motion sickness. My whole life, I have hated long car rides, even short car rides. As soon as I get in the car and buckle in, I already feel the nausea. I bought these for a 16-hour road trip, and they worked 100%. I felt perfectly comfortable the whole way through. I could even watch movies and text on my phone and feel alright. My two daughters suffer from the same thing (ages 1 and 3) to the point where they can't keep any food down. The kid's bands worked for them 100% of the time, too. 10/10 recommend. I'll be buying more for sure."" — Veronica Get a pair from Amazon for $8.53+ (available in six colors). These mitts are also a great way to prep your skin before applying sunless tanner! Promising review: ""Right out of the box, I could tell these mitts were going to be exactly what I needed. Excellent quality and easy to use! I’ve tried them twice already, and my skin is now incredibly smooth! After I scrubbed my arm, I looked at the mitt and saw it was covered with dead skin cells. I’ll be buying more of these as gifts for girlfriends (in a fun spa gift basket)!"" — Danielle Get it from Amazon for $10.99+ (available in three colors and in multipacks). Here's why my BuzzFeed Shopping colleague Emma Lord loves this thing: ""Hello, my toenails are problem children for two reasons: One is that they're kinda thick, the other is that I'm a long-distance runner, which doesn't play nice with toenails. I bought this recently, and the difference it made immediately was ENORMOUS. Like I usually dread approaching my big toenails because they are so thick, but these painlessly and seamlessly lobbed the tops right off; I was also able to ~gently correct~ a toenail that was starting to get ingrown, and help cut down a dead toenail that needed trimming but would have been painful to approach with a regular clipper."" Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""Amazing! I have very oily skin, and I’m always shiny. I hate those blotting papers; this is so much better! I roll it all over my face several times a day, and in seconds, my skin is matte again. Also, it’s like a nice little face massage when I do it. It is super easy to take apart to clean, and after using hot water and my facial cleanser, it dries pretty quickly, though I usually just let it sit out overnight. Highly recommend!! I’m going to buy more so I can leave them all over — purse, diaper bag, bathroom, car!"" — Brooke Burns Get it from Amazon for $12.99 . This product is formulated without parabens, phthalates, petrolatum, or SLS. Promising review: ""I’ve had this bottle for over a year! It’s lasted with my family through Disney World, Destin spring break, and every time we go to the pool! I’ve had some bad sunburns. I slather this on and reapply after it’s soaked in, and I wake up with a deep tan. Whatever is in it is like magic! The smell is kinda weird to me, but as well as this lotion works, it could smell like cough syrup, and I’d still happily use it."" — Natalie Smith Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Read more about tea tree oil and acne at Cleveland Clinic . Apply this gentle treatment 3–4 times a day or 4–6 times if the situation is more serious. Promising review: "" Worked like magic! I put it on a bad breakout and it was almost completely gone the next day. Love it."" — Babygirl Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Promising review: ""I use these wipes after long walks in summer heat when I’m not at home to shower. They get rid of the sweat and leave me clean and refreshed without the sticky feeling you get from most wipes."" — sherry baker Get a three-pack (45 wipes) from Amazon for $19.99 . Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. Promising review: ""I don't write reviews often but this toothbrush is so amazing I just had to. My teeth have never felt so smooth after brushing my teeth . Excellent at removing plaque and tartar and keeping it off throughout the day. If you're on the fence about purchasing, consider this the green light to go for it. You won't be disappointed."" — Cari C. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""Was exactly what I wanted. I was able to wear plenty of sundresses on vacation without worrying about chafing and discomfort. Lasted after swimming, too!"" — TC_06 Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in three sizes). The hairs in your nose play an important role in filtering out any harmful debris. But of course, it's your body, and if you want to wax your nose hairs, you're more than welcome to — just be careful, as plucking nose hairs can lead to infection and ingrown hairs. Read more about nose hair maintenance at Cleveland Clinic . Pulling nose hair straight from the root will give you results that can last up to FOUR weeks! With this kit, you'll have 100 grams of nose wax beads, 30 wax applicators, 10 mustache protectors, a measuring cup, and 15 paper cups at your disposal. Promising review: ""This is the easiest to use and takes care of nose hair. My new favorite beauty aid. 😉"" — Jackie Phillips Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . Promising review: ""I love having this case in my purse! If I forget my meds in the morning, I always have them with me. There’s also room for pain relief meds and vitamins. It’s compact with great compartment options. I’m happy with this purchase!"" — Hayley Get a three-pack from Amazon for $6.96 . TookTake is a woman-owned small business that started as a DIY solution to organizing the founder's many medications throughout her cancer treatment. It evolved into the sticker system you see today. I have a pretty checkered past when it comes to consistently taking my daily vitamins and medicine. Lately, I've opted for an in-your-face series of phone alarms, but on more than one occasion, I have absent-mindedly snoozed said alarm, only to be left wondering an hour later if I actually took my pill. That's what I really like about these tracking stickers — the marked tabs give you that answer at a glance, reducing the chance of missed or doubled doses. The only complaint is that the tabs can be a little tricky to remove, as other reviewers mention, but if you have any semblance of a fingernail, it shouldn't give you too much trouble. This is a cheap and discrete solution for forgetful humans who want to stay on top of better taking care of themselves. Get a three-pack (12 labels) from Amazon for $14.97 (also available in 10-day and hourly editions). Promising review: ""After just two days of use, this adorable little octopus has done wonders for me and smells great, too. Here's how I used it: I wore down the stick just a little to where the texture from the salt was visible, scrubbed around on my face so there was plenty of product, and then used my fingers to gently massage all the gunk away. Rinse, pat dry, and enjoy the softness. Highly recommended for people with sensitive skin like myself. "" — LuckLocust Get it from Amazon for $12.50 . Promising review: ""I tried EVERYTHING! I tried tree tea oil for years and various different products. Nothing worked. The reviews were so great on this that I decided to try to cure it one more time. But when you have had a condition for 35 years, you aren’t too hopeful! I followed the suggestions of some of the reviewers and cut my toenails (I only had it on my big toes) everywhere that the fungus was present. Even below the quick. I started applying this gel, which is super easy to use. I swear to you that I noticed a difference after one application."" — WIAPilot Get it from Amazon for $16.99 . Doctor Easy started 20 years ago with the invention of the Elephant Ear Washer by a doctor who saw the need for a better method of treating patients’ earwax impactions. Promising review: ""Gross photos. My husband has had a lot of earwax impaction problems in his life, and up until this point, we have paid to have a professional take care of it. But recently, he suddenly lost about 80% of his hearing and just couldn't wait for an appointment, so we bought this item. From the reviews I have read, it was a particularly easy solution for my husband. Nasty huge chunks start falling out after just a couple of squirts. Cleared everything out with no problem. Highly recommend."" — Tea Get it from Amazon for $29.45 . Promising review: ""I am so grateful for this product! Between high-stress levels and a job that makes me sweat a lot in the summer, I was breaking out all over my chest and upper arms. This treated the bad spots I already had and, so far, seems to be keeping new ones at bay. I'm sad that it didn't help my KP at all, but that's not what I bought it for, so I still give it 5 stars!"" — Rachel D. Get it from Amazon for $13.99 . I started using this stuff recently and my nails look presentable for basically the first time ever. It's no one-time-use miracle — you have to be consistent about the application. But if you are consistent, you'll be able to maintain happy, hydrated nails and cuticles with pretty minimal effort. Fun bonus: It smells absolutely delicious. Promising review: ""I had peeling, weak nails for years. Tried everything. I bought this in February. This size bottle lasted a bit more than a month, with me religiously applying it two to three times a day. I was really seeing great improvement, so I bought another bottle in late March. By May, all the peeling had grown out, and my nails were getting stronger every day. I then bought the big 4-ounce refill bottle because I never want to run out of it again! Cannot recommend this stuff enough!"" — Diana Get it from Amazon for $9.90+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""As a 62-year-old woman who gardens, cleans house, etc., I needed something that improved the look of my nails without looking cheap or crappy. This was more than I wanted to spend on nail polish...but totally worth it. Two coats showed NO ridges and looked better than natural nails without looking fake or cheap . Totally worth it!"" — Unbiased Independent Reviewer Get it from Amazon for $20 (available in five shades). Promising review: "" Took me a little while to figure out the right angle to use this effectively but once I did it worked like a charm. I’ve used it for shaping eyebrows and managing the little bit of blonde peach fuzz I have on my upper lip. I haven’t tried it anywhere else but no bad reactions or pain, and relatively easy to maneuver with a bit of practice."" — Kelly G. Get a three-pack from Amazon for $5.94 . You can reuse them for up to two years! Set them out in the sun for an hour to re-activate the charcoal. Promising review: ""Honestly kind of amazed. I've had them for a few months and haven't 'reset' them in the sun yet, but so far, no problems. I had this ridiculously smelly pair of sandals that got gross and embarrassing in the summer, and I just put these guys in them overnight, and I can wear the sandals for days on end. Glad I got these for sure."" — Karen Get a set of two from Amazon for $10.95 . If you suspect you have tonsil stones (also called tonsilloliths), talk to your dentist or doctor! They can perform a physical exam or imaging scan and deliver a diagnosis. Promising review: ""I'm in my early 30s and just started getting tonsil stones. Until a few months ago, I never even knew what these things were! Anyway, I've been struggling with cotton buds to fully remove the stones, but I couldn't get rid of them, and they would just come back within the week. I received this and OMFG...best investment ever. No struggle holding my phone as a flashlight while awkwardly poking myself in front of my badly lit bathroom mirror. I sat comfortably at my vanity, used one hand, and removed the whole stone in less than a minute. Why did I not know this was a thing? Why have I been struggling? Get it! Stop struggling, suffering, and awkwardly dealing with this ridiculous condition...trust me."" — Wren Get it from Amazon for $9.98 (available in blue and yellow). Check out this review on TikTok ! Promising review: ""If you're someone that has sensitive skin like me, this product is for you! I highly recommend it. I learned about this product on TikTok and decided to try it out. It's worth the money. The smell is not overbearing, and it reminds you of a refreshing citrusy fruit. I'm very particular about trying skincare products, but this is your go-to. It will have your face feeling refreshed and clear, and there's no white cast."" — Elisabeth L. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.99 . Puriya is a family-owned and operated business founded by two Taiwanese sisters who integrated their products with foundational ingredients from their mother's home-brew concoction of herbs and spices that she used to soothe their eczema as children. Read more about tea tree oil and how it can help with athlete's foot from Mayo Clinic and jock itch from Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""I ordered this balm on a whim as a remedy for a skin rash and was very impressed with its effectiveness! After getting rid of my rash, I decided to try it elsewhere and it worked wonders on dry skin areas like elbows, knees, and feet. I was blown away by how I changed my feet entirely! As a dancer, my feet have always been a war zone: dry skin, callouses, ingrown toenails, and athlete's foot (all frequent problems over the course of many years). I was always embarrassed to wear sandals or any type of shoes that would show off parts of my feet because of all the dry skin, but sometimes, it couldn't be avoided. This balm has made my feet the loveliest they have been, and now I can choose any type of shoes I want to wear without embarrassment. "" — anengstrom Get it from Amazon for $36.32 . Promising review: ""I had a stubborn wart on my right thumb that has been there for almost a year. Went to the doctor the first time to freeze it, but it didn't completely remove the wart, so I decided to try the gel. The gel helped, but not for too long, and the wart came back (in a couple of days). Long story short, I got these medicated bandages and the results are incredibly satisfying. I used these bandages every day for a week, and the next week, my wart is gone. So far, it's been a week after and I haven't noticed any growth. Highly recommend!"" — J Get a pack of 14 from Amazon for $7.29+ (available in three styles). Promising review: ""After just about three weeks of use I’ve seen such a positive change in both the evenness of time and of the texture of my skin. Melasma and acne scarring have faded pretty dramatically — I don’t even bother putting on foundation when I do my makeup in the morning. The oil is so lightweight and doesn’t exacerbate my already oily complexion. "" — L T C Get it from Amazon for $11.12 . Read more about compression gloves and other strategies to help relieve hand pain at Mayo Clinic . Promising review: ""As a professional tennis racquet stringer, I often work for 8–10 hours straight at the stringing machine. At 58 years old and having done this work for many years, I have developed arthritis in my hands. I’ve worn out many pairs of gloves similar to these. Most are cheaply made and torn apart at the seams in days. ComfyBrace gloves are the best quality I have found. They provide the relief I need, they’re comfortable, and they last longer than the other brands I’ve tried. With these gloves, I’m able to continue working a trade that I love. Thank you, ComfyBrace! Try these, and you will not regret it!"" — M. McDonald Get them from Amazon for $9.97 (available in unisex sizes S–XL). Bro Shaver is a Michigan-based small business with 14 years of research and development behind their innovative line of shavers for hard-to-reach places. Promising review: ""Wow. This is amazing! Followed the instructions and took my time during the first use. Just me and my bathroom mirror. About 20 minutes later, I have a perfectly smooth back. No nicks or missed spots. My back feels smooth to the touch. Now, I won't avoid the pool or lake this summer. A very smart purchase for me. I wish I had thought to take a before and after picture."" — David Get it from Amazon for $44.95 . Promising review: ""I have a TMJ mouth guard that is about 12 years old, and nothing else I've tried had managed to clean it like this stuff . It didn't take everything off the first time, but it makes a HUGE difference. Very satisfied."" — Sara E Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $21.81 .
