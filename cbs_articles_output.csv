CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-no-missing-minute-government-source-says/,U.S.,2025-07-29 06:00:00-04:00,"There was no ""missing minute"" in the original Epstein jail video, government source says",14,676,2025-07-29 17:06:57.755262,116,21,5,1,10,0,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 When the Justice Department and FBI released nearly 11 hours of footage earlier this month, the time code on the screen jumped forward one minute just before midnight, prompting questions about the one-minute gap. The video shows part of the area near the cell where Epstein was being held the night he died in what the medical examiner ruled a suicide . A government source familiar with the investigation says the FBI, the Bureau of Prisons and the Department of Justice inspector general are all in possession of a copy of the video that does not cut from just before 11:59 p.m. to midnight of the night Epstein died by suicide in his cell. What is unclear is why that section was missing when the FBI released what it said was raw footage from inside the Special Housing Unit the night Epstein died, Aug. 9-10, 2019. The recording came from what officials said was the only relevant video camera that was recording its footage in the unit. This video has been cited by multiple government officials as a key piece of evidence in the determination that Epstein died by suicide. Epstein's death, as with many aspects of his high-profile sex trafficking case , has become fodder for conspiracy theories. The missing minute added to the conjecture after the release of the video, when news organizations and amateur sleuths who reviewed the video quickly noticed that onscreen jump in the time stamp. Attorney General Pam Bondi was questioned about the gap during a July 8 Cabinet meeting with President Trump. She said the missing minute was the result of a nightly reset of the video that caused the recording system to miss one recording minute every night, and attributed that information to the Bureau of Prisons. ""There was a minute that was off that counter and what we learned from [the] Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said. The equipment was old — ""from like 1999, so every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute,"" she said. Bondi said the department would share other video that showed the same thing happened every night when the video system reset. That video, however, has not yet been released. One thing that is clear, forensic experts say, is that the version of the recording released by the FBI was edited and not raw, as the government stated. Bondi, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and others have said publicly that the video would be released unaltered. When the DOJ and FBI shared the video with the public, they said in a news release that it was the ""full raw"" video, and that ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" CBS asked the FBI and Justice Department for a response, but they declined to comment. The Bureau of Prisons said they ""had no additional information to provide.""

Ter took the stage at one of the most challenging piano competitions of her young career. She won. The February victory came less than two weeks after Ter's mother, Olesya, and 11-year-old sister Olivia were among the 67 people killed when their plane collided with a military helicopter and crashed into the Potomac River on Jan. 29. The family was returning from an event for elite figure skaters like Olivia. ""That was the best performance I ever played,"" Ter said. ""I was like, 'Oh, my mom would've been really proud of me.' And then, I won."" Final moments before the plane crash Ter had been texting with her mother during the flight's final moments. ""I'm like, 'Oh, have you landed yet?' And she goes, 'Almost.' And then I say, 'OK.' And it delivers, but it wasn't read,"" Ter said. Her father, Andrew Ter, was waiting at the airport to pick up his wife and younger daughter. Even after learning of the crash, he held onto hope they had survived. ""We did not know that was an explosion, right? So I thought, okay, both of them are excellent swimmers. You know, they'll be picked up, right?"" Andrew Ter said. The reality didn't fully hit Ter until weeks later. ""I don't think it hit me until like a solid month later,"" she said. ""You kept expecting them to walk into the house."" Competing after coping with loss With the competition approaching, Ter turned to her piano for solace. Her father wondered if she should withdraw, but she continued practicing. ""I remember there was a point in me when I was like, I have to play it,"" Ter said. ""Like I can't not play it. That was her dream piece for me to play."" To reach the Washington competition venue, the Ters had to drive past the airport and across the bridge near where the plane went down. But Ter said she could hear her mother's voice encouraging her. ""She said, 'You got this. Don't be scared.' And then I just went and played,"" Ter said. The performance brought a sense of normalcy to the grieving family. ""For that moment, you felt normal, right? It's like as if nothing happened,"" Andrew Ter said. ""I still felt like, you know, she was here, and she was listening and being near with us."" On Valentine's Day, less than a week after Ter's triumph, the family buried Olesya and Olivia. Ter's grand prize was the opportunity to perform with the Levine Showcase Orchestra in Washington, fulfilling her mother's dream of hearing her daughter play the piece with a full orchestra. The piece held special significance: Her mother adored it. ""She really loved that piece, and she wanted me to play it with orchestra,"" Ter said."

A court in the southern city of Ingolstadt convicted the defendants of gang robbery over the museum heist, German news agency dpa reported. A fourth defendant was acquitted of involvement in the museum heist but convicted of other thefts carried out by the group. The suspects from northern Germany were arrested months after a Nov. 22, 2022, break-in at the Celtic and Roman Museum in the Bavarian town of Manching, in which 483 Celtic coins discovered during a 1999 archaeological dig were stolen. The coins dated to around 100 B.C. The coins and a lump of unworked gold were originally discovered during excavations of an ancient settlement in Manching, and authorities have said they are considered the biggest trove of Celtic gold found in the 20th century. Coins of the Celtic Treasure are on display at the local Celtic and Roman Museum in Manching, Germany, May 31, 2006. (Frank Maechler/dpa via AP, file) Frank Maechler / AP The heist took place in just nine minutes, investigators said. At 1:17 a.m., cables were cut at a telecoms hub nearby, leaving the region without communications networks. The museum's door was pried open at 1:26 a.m. The thieves left the building at 1:35 a.m., officials said, leaving them just a few minutes to smash open a display case and take the treasure. No alarms were triggered during the incident. The museum did not have an overnight guard. Most of the stolen treasure is still missing, but investigators found lumps of gold on one of the suspects when he was arrested that appear to have resulted from part of the treasure being melted down. Rupert Gebhard, the head of the Bavarian State Archaeological Collection in Munich, said in 2022 that seeing the coins melted down would be ""the worst option."" The four defendants were accused of a total of 20 break-ins or attempted robberies in Germany and neighboring Austria, starting in 2014. Other cases involved safes or cash machines being broken into. The defendants didn't address the charges during the roughly six-month trial, but their lawyers called for their acquittal. The court sentenced them to prison terms ranging from four years and nine months to 11 years. Museums Germany Crime"

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials. The photos were the first from inside the main structural support called the pedestal in the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel, an area directly under the reactor's core.

Tea's investigation of the incident found that app users' direct messages had been breached, along with some of their photos. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken the affected system offline,"" Tea said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The app, which has become one of Apple's most downloaded free apps , was compromised in a cyberattack that exposed members' personal information, including selfies, Tea said Friday. The hackers accessed a data storage system containing information that members had uploaded prior to February 2024, the company said. An additional 59,000 images and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to Tea.

""A lot of people presume that if an app is available through Apple or Google, that it's safe. That's the first mistake consumers make,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Miracco also said Tea lacked adequate security protections. ""This is basic cybersecurity and something the company should be held accountable for,"" he said.

In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,U.S.,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:15.940013,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/novo-nordisk-shares-down-copycat-drugs-july-2025/,Entertainment,2025-07-29 13:40:24-04:00,Novo Nordisk shares fall 20% after company names new CEO and lowers its financial outlook,15,551,2025-07-29 17:15:16.021030,112,27,4,8,11,0,"Patients fear losing access to affordable weight loss drugs amid FDA crackdown 02:55 Novo Nordisk shares plunged over 20% on Tuesday after the company named a new CEO and lowered its profit expectations, citing weaker sales of its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy due to competition from copycat drugs. In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."

The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, ""the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,"" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division. ""What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space. ""It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth."" A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California carrying seven satellites, including NASA's twin TRACERS probes, SpaceX Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new ""polylingual"" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols. Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the ""radiation budget,"" and another that will focus on how high-energy ""killer electrons"" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere. Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental ""cubesat"" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world. The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg. The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad. A camera mounted on the Falcon 9's second stage shows the reusable first stage falling away and heading back to landing at Vandenberg, SpaceX's 27th booster recovery in California and its 479th overall. SpaceX A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch. Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later. TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind ""couples"" with Earth's magnetic field. ""So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,"" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa. ""And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system."" An artist's impression of the TRACERS satellites, flying one after the other in the same orbit. With two identical satellites, scientists expect to measure rapid changes in the near-Earth space environment as the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field. NASA That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays , ""but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that."" ""So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,"" Miles said. The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols. The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs. The first of two TRACERS satellites is released to fly on its own. (SpaceX) SpaceX Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space. Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites. The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator. ""The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,"" she said. ""These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction."" The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, ""it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them."" What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which ""could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.""

She found inspiration in the city as early as the 1920s, yet it would take the art world decades to recognize her and her iconic sculptures. ""She was given her first respective at the Whitney in 1967,"" said Maria Nevelson, the artist's granddaughter, who runs the Louise Nevelson Foundation. ""I was seven years old. And there was a line of people all the way around the block, up to the front door. I really did get chills. It was the first time I responded to artwork in general, and to my grandmother's artwork."" Nearly six decades later, the Whitney is holding a new Nevelson exhibition, which is open until August 10. The installation ""Collection View: Louise Nevelson,"" currently at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Asked what Louise was like as a grandmother, Maria laughed: ""Oh, she was intimidating and unconventional. What comes to mind first is her atmospheric dressing. Anything could have been pulled into this assemblage and this layering of rich brocades and silks."" That fancy wardrobe didn't stop Nevelson from getting her hands dirty: ""She'd dumpster dive, she'd get into the garbage can, she'd pull out filthy pieces of wood, and we'd have to take 'em home,"" said Maria. ""I would say the streets of New York weren't paved with gold for her; it was paved with garbage. And she loved it!"" Artist Louise Nevelson (1899-1988). Science History Images/Alamy Nevelson's attraction to wood may have grown from her family tree – her family owned lumber yards in present-day Ukraine, where she was born in 1899. Louise was a young girl who spoke no English when her father decided to move the family to Rockland, Maine. ""It was a bustling seaport town,"" said Maria. ""They got off the train and, she said, rednecks threw mud at them. And she said, 'I knew I was a Jew, I knew I was different.' She was about five, six years old then. That's her greeting to America."" Undaunted, Nevelson learned English, and at age nine, announced she was going to be a sculptor. ""She knew always what she wanted to be and do, and she pursued it fiercely,"" said Brooke Minto, executive director and CEO of the Columbus Museum of Art, where Nevelson's work is also currently on display. ""It was a decade's long journey, and she just kept at it."" Louise Nevelson's 1962 work titled ""Dawn"" (on display at the Columbus Museum of Art) features numerous found objects, from baseball bats and rolling pins to bits of broken furniture. Nevelson would choose a monochromatic palette to unify her materials. Minto said, ""She really understood that she could create an all-over, immersive experience in her sculpture by pairing them down to a single color. It's this wonderful accumulation of very simple and humble objects into something that's quite monumental and immediately historical."" A detail from Louise Nevelson's ""Young Shadows"" (1959-60), at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. It includes raw and ragged pieces of wood, reminding the viewer that it was once something else. According to Maria Nevelson, Louise did her best work when she was in her 70s and 80s, ""right up to when she passed away at 88."" In 1979, Charles Osgood, of ""Sunday Morning,"" spoke to Louise when she was 79 years old and, arguably, at the height of her career.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-revoke-endangerment-finding-regulating-greenhouse-gases/,U.S.,2025-07-29 15:31:54-04:00,"EPA to revoke ""endangerment finding,"" landmark basis for regulating greenhouse gases",11,1228,2025-07-29 17:15:16.320265,118,32,3,12,10,0,"Details on Trump EPA proposal to roll back Biden-era pollution limits 03:51 The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

Top tax relief advice to know now Before you take any steps to resolve your tax debt, make sure you take this important information into account: Start with direct IRS communication : Before considering professional assistance, it may benefit you to try and resolve your tax debt directly with the IRS. The agency offers various programs that might resolve your situation without additional fees. Understand minimum debt thresholds : Most reputable tax relief companies require minimum debt amounts because the fees charged for services often make them impractical for smaller obligations. If you owe less than $10,000, carefully evaluate whether professional assistance provides sufficient value compared to the costs involved. Beware of unrealistic guarantees : Legitimate tax relief companies cannot guarantee specific outcomes since only the IRS determines final settlement amounts. Be suspicious of firms promising you'll pay only a small percentage of your debt or guaranteeing acceptance into specific programs before reviewing your complete financial situation. Understand fee structures completely : Reputable tax relief companies provide clear explanations of their fee structures during consultations. Avoid firms that demand large upfront payments or use high-pressure sales tactics to rush your decision-making process. The bottom line Tax relief companies can provide valuable assistance for taxpayers facing substantial debt or complex situations, but success depends on choosing the right firm for your specific circumstances. Start by attempting direct resolution with the IRS, then research potential companies thoroughly, focusing on credentials, customer reviews and transparent fee structures. And, remember that legitimate tax relief takes time, often months or years, and no company can guarantee specific outcomes. The best tax relief companies combine professional expertise with realistic expectations, clear communication and proven track records of helping clients achieve sustainable solutions to their tax debt challenges."

For his induction into the Hall of Fame ? Not so much. ""Of course, I'm nervous and I probably should be preparing more, but this morning I actually went to the field, long tossed and kind of ran and did my workout, so I guess for me that was more important,"" Suzuki said Saturday through an interpreter on the eve of his enshrinement. Suzuki is the first Japanese player chosen for the Hall and fell one vote shy of becoming the second unanimous selection. He will be joined Sunday by CC Sabathia, a six-time All-Star who won the 2007 AL Cy Young Award, and relief pitcher Billy Wagner. Dave Parker, who died a month before he was to be inducted, and Dick Allen were honored posthumously. They were voted in by the classic era committee. Baseball Hall of Fame inductees Billy Wagner, left, Ichiro Suzuki, second from left, and CC Sabathia, center, pose for a photo with Willa Allen, second fromright, wife of Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Dick Allen, and Dave Parker II, right, son of Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Dave Parker, at the National Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cooperstown, New York, on Sunday, July 27, 2025. Seth Wenig / AP MLB has been profoundly impacted by Japan since Suzuki's arrival in 2001. His induction coincided with the opening of an exhibit at the Hall on Thursday entitled Yakyu/Baseball: The Transpacific Exchange of the Game, which celebrates the ways Japanese and American baseball are interconnected. It honors not just Suzuki but also pitcher Hideo Nomoi and current two-way star Shohei Otani. As interconnected as the two countries are, Suzuki does not want Japanese baseball to become a carbon copy of MLB. ""I don't think Japan should copy what MLB does. I think Japanese baseball should be Japanese baseball and the way they do things, and MLB should be the way they are. I think they should be different and not the same,"" he said. Suzuki received 393 of 394 votes (99.7%) from the Baseball Writers' Association of America. Sabathia was on 342 ballots (86.8%) and Wagner on 325 (82.5%), which was 29 votes more than the 296 needed for the required 75%. Suzuki joked about falling one vote shy of a unanimous induction, calling out the one writer who left him off the ballot. The ballots are secret, so it's not known who kept Suzuki off their list, but after the totals had been announced, Suzuki initially offered to have that writer over for dinner. ""Three thousand hits or 262 hits in one season are achievements recognized by the writers. Well, all but one of you,"" he said during his speech on Sunday. ""By the way, the offer for that writer to have dinner at my home has now expired."" Only one player in the Hall's history has been voted in unanimously : legendary New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who received all 425 possible votes in 2019. Suzuki was a two-time AL batting champion and 10-time All-Star and Gold Glove outfielder, hitting .311 with 117 homers, 780 RBIs and 509 stolen bases with Seattle, the New York Yankees and Miami. He is perhaps the best contact hitter ever, with 1,278 hits in Nippon Professional Baseball and 3,089 in MLB, including a season-record 262 in 2004. His combined total of 4,367 exceeds Pete Rose's MLB record of 4,256. Suzuki visited the Hall seven times during his career, but this time is different. ""I had a purpose. I would come to the basement and look at some of the artifacts. This time around, though, I didn't come to have one purpose to see something. I just wanted to experience Cooperstown, take it all in. That's the difference this time around. ""This is the place where I'd come (during the season) and kind of cleanse myself and get a great feeling again,"" he said. Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Ichiro Suzuki speaks at the National Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cooperstown, New York, on Sunday, July 27, 2025. Seth Wenig / AP For Sabathia, his induction represents a full-circle moment because his plaque will have him sporting a Yankees cap with the interlocking NY. A native of Vallejo, California, Sabathia ""thought I wanted to be close to home,"" but after ""pretending"" the Yankees didn't offer him a contract on the first day of free agency, his wife persuaded him to sign with the Bronx Bombers following an in-home meeting with general manager Brian Cashman. ""My wife was the one that said: 'You're trying to do all these different things, figure out all these contracts. You need to go where they want you. All you talk about is you want to win, be a winner and all these things. How can you not go to New York? That's the one place they try to win every single year.' When she put it that way, it was like I was born to be a Yankee,"" Sabathia said. ""And I think for the longest time I tried to run away from that because my father would always tell me I was going to play for the Yankees. He passed away when I was 23, so he wasn't there to tell me it was OK if I failed. I think I was scared to go there and fail. But it ended up being the best decision I ever made. I ran from that decision for a long time. I thought I wanted to play on the other coast, but I think I was born to play with the pinstripes."" Baseball Hall of Fame inductee CC Sabathia waves during the Baseball Hall of Fame Parade of Legends in Cooperstown, New York, on Saturday, July 26, 2025. Seth Wenig / AP Suzuki and Sabathia were teammates for more than two seasons, which makes their induction extra special. ""It feels like we're teammates. Obviously, Ichi and I were rookies together. I always say he stole my Rookie of the Year award (in 2001) so it's great to be able to go in the HOF with him and Billy,"" Sabathia said. Sabathia went 251-161 with a 3.74 ERA and 3,093 strikeouts, third among left-handers behind Randy Johnson and Steve Carlton, during 19 seasons with Cleveland, Milwaukee and the Yankees. While Sabathia and Suzuki were elected in their first appearance on the ballot, Wagner made it on his 10th and final try. ""Well, after seeing how a lot of guys like Lee Smith and Ted Simmons and (other) guys had to wait their turn to get to this point and go through the veterans committee, and how hard it is to get in here, you know, it's well worth the wait,"" Wagner said. Newly-elected Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Billy Wagner talks to reporters during a news conference on Thursday, Jan. 23, 2025, in Cooperstown, New York. Hans Pennink / AP Wagner, a seven-time All-Star, became the ninth pitcher in the Hall who was primarily a reliever, after Hoyt Wilhelm, Rollie Fingers, Dennis Eckersley, Bruce Sutter, Goose Gossage, Trevor Hoffman, Lee Smith and Mariano Rivera. Wagner is the only left-hander. Two others honored Saturday were longtime Cleveland Guardians broadcaster Tom Hamilton, winner of the Ford C. Frick Award for broadcasting, and retired Washington Post sports writer and columnist Tom Boswell, who received the BBWAA Career Excellence Award.

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"

What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

Tea's investigation of the incident found that app users' direct messages had been breached, along with some of their photos. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken the affected system offline,"" Tea said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The app, which has become one of Apple's most downloaded free apps , was compromised in a cyberattack that exposed members' personal information, including selfies, Tea said Friday. The hackers accessed a data storage system containing information that members had uploaded prior to February 2024, the company said. An additional 59,000 images and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to Tea. Tea lets women share information about their dates and run background checks on potential matches, among other things. Ted Miracco, CEO at mobile security maker Approov, urged users to exhibit caution in sharing personal information on widely downloaded apps.. ""A lot of people presume that if an app is available through Apple or Google, that it's safe. That's the first mistake consumers make,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Miracco also said Tea lacked adequate security protections. ""This is basic cybersecurity and something the company should be held accountable for,"" he said.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gaza-famine-scenario-food-security-experts-israel-war/,World,2025-07-29 10:15:00-04:00,"""Worst-case scenario of famine unfolding"" in Gaza Strip, food security experts say",12,877,2025-07-29 17:15:17.017077,113,21,4,1,11,1,"Experts warn of famine in Gaza happening now 04:53 The ""worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out in the Gaza Strip,"" the leading international authority on food crises said in a new alert Tuesday , predicting ""widespread death"" without immediate action. The alert, still short of a formal famine declaration, follows an outcry over images of emaciated children in Gaza and reports of dozens of hunger-related deaths after nearly 22 months of war. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. The United Nations and Palestinians on the ground say little has changed, and desperate crowds continue to overwhelm and unload delivery trucks before they can reach their destinations. A charity distributes meals to Palestinians facing food shortages amid ongoing Israeli attacks and severe restrictions in Gaza City, Gaza on July 28, 2025. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Gaza has teetered on the brink of famine for two years, but recent developments have ""dramatically worsened"" the situation, including ""increasingly stringent blockades"" by Israel. ""Mounting evidence shows that widespread starvation, malnutrition, and disease are driving a rise in hunger-related deaths. Latest data indicates that Famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of the Gaza Strip and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City,"" the IPC said. ""Immediate action must be taken to end the hostilities and allow for unimpeded, large-scale, life-saving humanitarian response. This is the only path to stopping further deaths and catastrophic human suffering."" A formal famine declaration, which is rare, requires the kind of data that the lack of access to Gaza and mobility within it have largely denied. The IPC has only declared famine a few times — in Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and parts of Sudan's western Darfur region last year. ""Deadly turning point"" reached But independent experts say they don't need a formal declaration to know what they're seeing in Gaza. ""Just as a family physician can often diagnose a patient she's familiar with based on visible symptoms without having to send samples to the lab and wait for results, so too we can interpret Gaza's symptoms. This is famine,"" Alex de Waal, author of ""Mass Starvation: The History and Future of Famine"" and executive director of the World Peace Foundation, told The Associated Press. An area is classified as in famine when all three of the following conditions are confirmed: At least 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or are essentially starving. At least 30% of children six months to 5 years old suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they're too thin for their height. And at least two people or four children under 5 per 10,000 are dying daily due to starvation or the interaction of malnutrition and disease. The report is based on available information through July 25 and says the crisis has reached ""an alarming and deadly turning point."" It says data indicates that famine thresholds have been reached for food consumption in most of Gaza — at its lowest level since the war began — and for acute malnutrition in Gaza City. The report says nearly 17 out of every 100 children under the age of 5 in Gaza City are acutely malnourished. Mounting evidence shows ""widespread starvation,"" the IPC says. Essential health and other services have collapsed. One in three people in Gaza is going without food for days at a time, according to the World Food Program. Hospitals report a rapid increase in hunger-related deaths in children under 5. Gaza's population of over 2 million has been squeezed into increasingly tiny areas of the devastated territory. The IPC's latest analysis in May warned that Gaza will likely fall into famine if Israel doesn't lift its blockade and stop its military campaign. Its new alert calls for immediate and large-scale action and warns: ""Failure to act now will result in widespread death in much of the strip."" Israel has restricted aid to varying degrees throughout the war. In March, it cut off the entry of all goods, including fuel, food and medicine, to pressure Hamas to free hostages. Israel eased those restrictions in May but also pushed ahead with a new U.S.-backed aid delivery system that has been wracked by chaos and violence. The traditional, U.N.-led aid providers say deliveries have been hampered by Israeli military restrictions and incidents of looting, while criminals and hungry crowds swarm entering convoys. While Israel says there's no limit on how many aid trucks can enter Gaza, U.N. agencies and aid groups say even the latest humanitarian measures are not enough to counter the worsening starvation . In a statement Monday, Doctors Without Borders called the new airdrops ineffective and dangerous, saying they deliver less aid than trucks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said no one is starving in Gaza and that Israel has supplied enough aid throughout the war, ""otherwise, there would be no Gazans."" Israel's military on Monday criticized what it calls ""false claims of deliberate starvation in Gaza."" Israel's closest ally now appears to disagree. ""Those children look very hungry,"" President Trump said Monday of the images from Gaza in recent days. Hamas Israel Gaza Famine"

Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials. The photos were the first from inside the main structural support called the pedestal in the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel, an area directly under the reactor's core.

That won't happen this week, economists say.",16,1064,2025-07-29 17:15:17.304565,119,22,8,3,11,0,"Breaking down dispute between Trump and Powell 02:23 During a meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a ""very simple"" request: ""Interest rates have to come down."" That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision on Wednesday. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation. Mr. Trump has for months derided Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a building renovation at the Fed could be grounds for firing. Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite. ""With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,"" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note. In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low. However, the Consumer Price Index — a key gauge for tracking inflation — in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher. Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know. When is the Fed making its rate cut decision? The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook. Who makes decisions on interest rates? The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy. Lately, at least two members of the FOMC — Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates. ""[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,"" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. ""From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink."" Could the Fed cut rates on Wednesday? It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut. For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that second-quarter GDP rose by 1.8%, below 2024's 2.8% rate. With economic clouds on the horizon, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note. Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation. ""Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,"" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email. How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump? Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment. Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about replacing him as Fed chair , he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,"" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy. When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates? The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut. Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%. ""With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,"" Daco said. ""We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.""

But there are ways to improve sleep issues . Why getting a good night's rest can get harder with aging Sleep psychologist Shelby Harris told ""CBS Mornings Plus "" that stress, sleep structure and hormonal changes can impact sleep as people age. ""As we start to move into our 60s, 70s, you have more issues with the depth of your sleep, so your sleep is just lighter in general,"" she said. ""There's sleep disorders, like insomnia, that happens, and then you have to go to the bathroom more at night."" According to to the Sleep Foundation, a group focused on sleep health education, 40-70% of people 65 and older above experience chronic sleep problems. For older women, the hormones estrogen and progesterone start to drop, leading to sleep challenges . ""We have more hot flashes, night sweats. You actually have more sleep apnea in women as well, and just more insomnia too,"" Harris said. There may also be some evolutionary reasoning behind why older adults get less deep sleep, Harris said. ""The deepest stage of sleep is where your muscles are repairing, you're growing — and as you're getting older, you don't need that ideally as much as you do when you're younger,"" she said, adding that younger kids get a lot of deep sleep. ""(Older adults) just wake up a lot more because of pain and movement and having to urinate."" Do adults need less sleep? Harris said it's a myth that older adults don't need a lot of sleep. ""If a doctor tells you that is normal to get a lot less as you get older, definitely seek some other advice,"" Harris said. Some who don't get a full night's rest might supplement with daytime sleep, which is something a lot of older adults do as their days become less structured, she said. Tips for improving sleep as you age In addition to the standard rules for good sleep hygiene , which include a cool, dark, quiet sleep environment and a consistent bedtime routine, there are other ways to support good sleep. If you wake up a lot in the middle of the night, Harris suggests taking time for meditation during the day. ""Because if you have a busy brain, meditating five minutes during the day can help to actually ease your brain more at night,"" she said. To try and get better sleep at night, you can also try spending less time in bed during the day, she said, including reducing naps. And if nothing's working after a few weeks, talk with the doctor, Harris advised. ""We do have a lot of treatments like cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia, you might need a sleep study, medication. We have lots of options,"" she said.

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,Health,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:17.712915,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"

That's according to a new survey from F&G Annuities & Life, which polled 2,000 U.S. adults over 50 years old. The life insurance and annuities company found that 23% of those polled have already decided to delay their retirement as they grapple with questions about their financial readiness, up from 14% in 2024. The findings come at a time when the median savings of 55-year-olds is just $50,000, far from enough to fund a secure old age, according to another recent study by Prudential Financial. The F&G survey provides a snapshot into the thinking of Gen X, ages 45 to 60, whose oldest members are now entering their pre-retirement years. The average retirement age in the United States is 62, which is also the earliest age at which people can start claiming Social Security benefits. The longer a person waits to claim Social Security, the higher benefit they'll receive from the program. The full retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67, at which point workers can receive their full benefits. Those who delay claiming until age 70, however, can get another 24% boost to their monthly checks. Among the 23% in the F&G study who plan to delay claims on their Social Security benefits, half cited financial uncertainties or economic volatility as the reason for their decision to delay retirement — a 10% increase from last year. Forty-four percent said they are worried about inflation, while 34% indicated they are worried about a recession or stock market downturn. They're not the only ones, according to David John, a senior policy adviser at AARP. The majority of Americans nearing retirement age are unsure of whether they will have enough money to make it through retirement as they fret over inflation and general economy uncertainty, he told CBS MoneyWatch. Along those lines, Johns said he's also observed that people are cutting back on their retirement savings or pulling money out of retirement savings to deal with unexpected costs or inflationary pressures. ""Of course, that helps in the short run, but that means that you have even more people who have worries once they start to get to retirement,"" he said. Unlike 401(k)s and other retirement accounts, Social Security benefits are protected from inflation because the agency institutes a cost-of-living adjustment each year, John pointed out. To guard against disruptions to retirement plans, John suggests that people consistently put away money — even if it's just a small amount each month. ""Save and continue to save,"" he said. ""Because any amount of retirement savings is going to be better than no retirement savings."" Social Security Administration Savings Social Security"

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

A new analysis landed on a number different than the 10,000 daily step recommendation you may have previously heard. The research, published Wednesday in The Lancet Public Health journal, looked at dozens of past studies published between Jan. 1, 2014, and Feb. 14, 2025. It found that 7,000 steps a day was associated with a 47% lower risk of death, a 38% lower risk of dementia and a 25% lower risk of heart disease, among other health benefits, when compared to people who only had about 2,000 steps a day. Risk of death from certain diseases also went down, including a 47% lower risk of death from heart disease and a 37% lower risk of death from cancer . The higher number of steps was found to have ""a non-significant"" 6% lower risk of getting cancer, the authors of the research said. The step count was also associated with a 14% lower risk of type 2 diabetes, a 22% lower risk of depressive symptoms and a 28% lower risk of falls . ""Although 10,000 steps per day can still be a viable target for those who are more active, 7,000 steps per day is associated with clinically meaningful improvements in health outcomes and might be a more realistic and achievable target for some,"" the authors wrote. If 7,000 steps still seems like a lot, even a more modest step count was associated with lower risk. For example, 4,000 steps per day compared to 2,000 was associated with substantial risk reduction, including a 36% lower risk in death, according to the analysis. The bottom line? Walking — at whatever amount you can accomplish in a day — is good for your body and mind. The research did have some limitations, the authors noted, including a lack of age-specific analysis and a small number of studies available for most specific outcomes. Still, the authors say they hope the 7,000 step count can serve as a practical public health target with future studies looking closer at age-specific targets. Health"

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials. The photos were the first from inside the main structural support called the pedestal in the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel, an area directly under the reactor's core.

The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, ""the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,"" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division. ""What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California carrying seven satellites, including NASA's twin TRACERS probes, SpaceX Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new ""polylingual"" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols. Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the ""radiation budget,"" and another that will focus on how high-energy ""killer electrons"" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere. Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental ""cubesat"" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world. The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg. The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad. A camera mounted on the Falcon 9's second stage shows the reusable first stage falling away and heading back to landing at Vandenberg, SpaceX's 27th booster recovery in California and its 479th overall. SpaceX A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch. Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later. TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind ""couples"" with Earth's magnetic field. ""So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,"" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa. ""And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system."" An artist's impression of the TRACERS satellites, flying one after the other in the same orbit. With two identical satellites, scientists expect to measure rapid changes in the near-Earth space environment as the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field. NASA That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays , ""but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that."" ""So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,"" Miles said. The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols. The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs. The first of two TRACERS satellites is released to fly on its own. (SpaceX) SpaceX Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space. Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites. The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator. ""The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,"" she said. ""These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction."" The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, ""it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them."" What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which ""could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.""

The new feature is intended to protect young teens from harmful content, the company says. Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool will be able to assess a person's age based on the types of videos they've watched, the categories of the videos, and how long the person has had their account — regardless of the birthday associated with it, James Beser, director of product management at YouTube , said in a statement on the platform's blog. If the technology identifies a person as under 18, it will take extra steps to regulate their content by disabling personalized advertising and limiting repetitive views of certain kinds of content, among other things. If YouTube incorrectly determines someone's age, the user can upload a form of identification to fix the error. ""We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users,"" YouTube said in the blog post. Google, which is the parent company of YouTube, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. According to a recent Pew survey , YouTube is the most popular social media app among teens. Ninety percent of teens ages 13 to 17 said they used YouTube last year, compared with 63% who said they used TikTok. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan initially announced the age-detection technology in February . The new tool builds on other safety features like supervised accounts which allow parents to monitor their children's YouTube activity more closely. YouTube has also leveraged AI to identify and remove content it considers harmful, although since President Trump took office in January for his second term, the social media platform has shifted its policy to emphasize ""freedom of expression"" over safety, The New York Times reported . YouTube says it will be testing the age-detection tool in the coming weeks among a small set of U.S. users, before rolling out the technology to a wider audience. The tool is already being used in other markets with success, the company states on its blog, but does not specify where. Google Artificial Intelligence YouTube"

Police identified him as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said surveillance video shows the suspect leaving a double-parked black BMW alone and entering the building on Park Avenue with an M4 rifle in his right hand. He immediately opened fire at NYPD officer Didarul Islam, killing him. The gunman then shot a woman who'd taken shelter behind a pillar, then moved through the lobby, peppering it with gunfire, officials said. He then shot a security guard who'd taken cover behind a security desk. Another man who was wounded told police at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital he was shot in the lobby, Tisch said. The police commissioner said at one point the gunman was waiting for an elevator to arrive and when it did, a woman came out but he let her walk by unharmed. The gunman then took the elevator to the 33rd floor offices of Rudin Management and ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" Tisch said, killing one person before walking down the hallway and shooting himself in the chest. NYPD officers stand in line during the dignified transfer of Didarul Islam, who was shot and killed by a gunman Monday evening, out of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Hospital to the medical examiner's office, early on July 29, 2025, in New York. Angelina Katsanis / AP One man who works in the building told he ""heard all these loud bangs, had no idea what it was ... I turn around all these people are running. ... I came out five minutes later (and) one of my co-workers came out and he said he saw two people get shot, and five minutes after that another one of our co-workers came out and said he saw two police officers trying to go up to the elevator banks that go to the higher floors."" A woman who also works in the area told the station, ""We rushed the window in the direction where the helicopters are going, and then, we look and there's cop cars everywhere, and then someone pulls up Twitter and we find out that there is an active shooter."" The building houses the headquarters of the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment firms, and has numerous other well-known tenants. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the gunman appeared to have been targeting the NFL offices. ""He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,"" Adams said on ""CBS Mornings"" Tuesday. A perimeter was blocked off around the building for blocks in every direction. NYPD officers and caution tape warned passersby away. Helicopters passed overhead for hours. People were told to shelter in place in buildings in the vicitniity. A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting. Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday. A young man who moved to New York only two weeks ago to work for Bank of America came to check out the scene. At an building nearby, people were ordering in late takeout food and gathering in the lobby. They told of colleagues who'd stepped out to get food as it was happening, not realizing what was going on down the block. Even hours after the shooting, one young woman seemed unsure if it was safe to leave.

Local TV footage showed lines of people evacuating the office building where the shootings took place with their hands above their heads in the hours after the killings, according to The Associated Press. Nekeisha Lewis was eating dinner with friends on the nearby plaza when she heard gunfire. ""It felt like it was a quick two shots and then it was rapid fire,"" she told the AP. Windows shattered and a man ran from the building saying, ""Help, help. I'm shot."" Lewis said. Kyle Marshall, 38, was working at a nearby Morgan Stanley office when his mother texted him about an active-shooter incident, asking if he was OK, Reuters reports. ""Then she texted me the address, and I was, like, 'Oh my God. That's right next door to my building,'"" he said. Marshall lives in the San Francisco area but comes to New York monthly for work.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,Sports,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:19.303497,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote. Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to ""ensure accuracy and fairness,"" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create ""security risks and undermines the integrity of the process."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25 to discuss Epstein. After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment ""on the substance"" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that ""there were a lot of questions and we went all day."" Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is ""allowed"" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.

The deadline for applications to the program is midnight Friday. With those deferred resignations, NASA's civil servant workforce would shrink from about 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. This figure also includes about 500 employees who were lost through normal attrition, the agency said. ""Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,"" NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner said in a statement. According to NASA, about 870 employees applied to leave during the first round of the Deferred Resignation Program, and about 3,000 employees during the second round. The deferred resignation program was a buyout program introduced across the federal government by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the onset of the Trump administration in an effort to slash costs and reduce the size of the federal workforce. A White House budget proposal issued in May would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18 billion. NASA has also been roiled by a leadership crisis in recent months. In December, President Trump nominated billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman, a friend of former DOGE head Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator. Musk's SpaceX has several NASA contracts . However, in late May, Mr. Trump pulled Isaacman's nomination just ahead of the Senate confirmation vote, which was followed days later by a public fallout between Mr. Trump and Musk.

Tax season can be stressful enough on its own, but when you're facing a hefty tax bill or are still dealing with delinquent tax debt from years prior, it can feel downright overwhelming. After all, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) isn't exactly known for its leniency, and tax debt can quickly become overwhelming if left unaddressed. So, whether you've fallen behind on payments, received an unexpected assessment or are struggling with years of accumulated tax debt , you might be wondering if there's any way to lighten the load. The good news is that there may be ways to do that. What many people don't realize is that the tax code includes various provisions for reducing tax debt. The challenge is knowing how to navigate these complex regulations and successfully negotiate with the IRS — which is something that most taxpayers aren't equipped to handle on their own. That's where tax relief services come into play. These specialized firms employ experienced tax specialists and enrolled agents who understand the nuances of tax law and have experience negotiating with the IRS on behalf of taxpayers. While they can't make your tax debt disappear entirely, they can often help reduce what you owe through several legitimate methods. Chat with a tax relief expert about your options today . 4 ways a tax relief service can reduce your tax bill If you're looking for ways to reduce your tax debt, here are a few ways a tax relief service can help: Offer in Compromise (OIC) negotiations One of the most powerful tools in a tax relief service's arsenal is the ability to negotiate an Offer in Compromise with the IRS. An Offer in Compromise is a way to settle your tax debt for less than what you owe, but the IRS only approves OICs if they believe you genuinely can't pay the full amount, either in a lump sum or through installments — so a tax relief service can be invaluable during this process. A tax relief service can assess your financial situation, prepare a strong case and negotiate with the IRS on your behalf. They'll ensure that your offer meets the IRS's criteria, improving your chances of acceptance. If successful, an OIC can significantly reduce your tax burden and allow you to move forward without the constant stress of looming debt. Find out how to settle your IRS tax debt here . Penalty abatement assistance One of the biggest frustrations people have with their tax debt is the accumulation of penalties and interest. The IRS penalties can add up to 25% or more of the original tax debt, so even a relatively small initial debt can balloon into a much larger amount due to late fees and compounding interest. Tax relief services can help you request penalty abatement, though, which is the removal of these additional charges, if you have reasonable cause for not meeting your tax obligations. The servicers know how to document and present circumstances like financial hardship, medical emergencies or incorrect tax advice from tax professionals in a way that resonates with IRS reviewers. A successful penalty abatement can save you thousands of dollars, even if you still need to pay the original tax amount. Installment agreement optimization If paying off your tax debt in full isn't feasible, an installment agreement can break it down into manageable monthly payments. The IRS offers different types of payment plans, but qualifying for the best terms can be tricky, as can finding one that truly works for your financial situation. Tax relief professionals know the ins and outs of these agreements and can negotiate lower monthly payments or extended timelines to help ease your financial strain. More importantly, they know how to advocate for lower monthly payments by properly documenting your financial hardship and using the IRS Fresh Start initiative provisions that you might not know about. And, with a well-structured plan in place, you can avoid harsh penalties while gradually paying off what you owe. Strategic tax return review and amendment In certain cases, reducing your tax bill starts with correcting past mistakes. Tax relief services can help with this by thoroughly reviewing your previous returns to identify potential errors or missed deductions that could be working against you. If they find legitimate opportunities to reduce your tax liability, they can help you file amended returns and even secure a refund. This process requires extensive knowledge of tax law and documentation requirements, though — which is precisely the type of expertise that tax relief professionals have developed through years of experience. The bottom line Working with a tax relief service isn't a magic solution to make all your tax problems disappear overnight. However, these professionals can provide valuable expertise and representation that most taxpayers simply don't have access to on their own. They understand the complex web of tax regulations, relief programs and negotiation strategies that can lead to meaningful reductions in your tax debt. Before hiring a tax relief service, just make sure to do your due diligence. Look for firms with a strong track record, positive client reviews and transparent pricing. Be wary of companies that make unrealistic promises about eliminating all your tax debt or guarantee specific results. Ultimately, the most reputable tax relief services will be upfront about what they can and cannot do for your specific situation."

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day?

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/eu-trade-deal-trump-tariff/,MoneyWatch,2025-07-29 14:37:07-04:00,Did the U.S. or the EU emerge as the winner in Trump trade deal?,14,868,2025-07-29 17:15:19.973394,114,21,3,2,13,0,"Trump drives EU trade deal over the finish line after months of tense talks 03:55 The new trade agreement between the U.S. and the European Union will lift tariffs on imports of goods from EU countries to their highest level in decades and hurt the trading bloc's economic growth, according to some experts. ""It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,"" economists with investment bank Société Générale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation."" The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast. EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.) The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028. The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration. ""This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,"" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet about the pact. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Reducing uncertainty Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports . More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week — both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff — also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said. ""[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,"" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Société Générale, told CBS MoneyWatch. European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products. Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a statement on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters. ""We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,"" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the deal ""at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market."" According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April. Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits. ""Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-digital-friendship-with-teens-common-sense-media-study/,World,2025-07-23 20:28:00-04:00,More teens say they're using AI for friendship. Here's why researchers are concerned,13,1377,2025-07-29 17:15:20.099662,105,22,1,2,9,0,"Inside the debate over teens using AI companions for support 04:11 No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence . The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party. The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. ""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking."" For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you."" More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are ""everywhere in teens' lives."" Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships. ""Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,"" Steyer said. ""They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings."" As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified."" All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. ""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people."" How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. ""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it."" Artificial Intelligence"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,MoneyWatch,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:20.203711,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report.

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day? Best sources of iron other than red meat Connelly's suggestions for plant-based iron sources include: Lentils Beans Tofu Pumpkin seeds Spinach Certain seafoods are also great choices, she added, including: Oysters Clams Sardines Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of The Nutrition Changer , said another important source of iron in the United States if fortified breads and cereals.

Still worried you're not getting enough iron? Supplements are another option to consider after consulting your doctor, experts said.

In the study, published Thursday in the British Journal of Sports Medicine , researchers created a predictive model to estimate the impact of different levels of physical activity on life expectancy using data about people who were at least 40 years old from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey and other sources. Though it was an observational study, which doesn't prove cause and effect, the findings suggest increased focus on physical activity can potentially pay off in terms of Americans' lifespans. ""Our findings suggest that (physical activity) provides substantially larger health benefits than previously thought, which is due to the use of more precise means of measuring (it),"" the authors wrote. So how much do you have to exercise to gain the potential benefits? The total physical activity of the most active 25% of Americans was equivalent to 160 minutes of walking at a normal pace, or about 3 miles per hour, every day, according to the study. If all Americans over 40 matched this level of activity, life expectancy at birth would bump from 78.6 years to nearly 84 years, about a 5-year increase in average lifespan. If the least active Americans committed to an extra 111 minutes of walking daily, the effects were even more dramatic, the estimates indicate — adding almost 11 years to the average lifespan. This isn't the first time research has highlighted the health benefits of walking . A study last year from the same journal found walking just 11 minutes per day could significantly lower the risk of stroke, heart disease and some cancers.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-transcontinental-railroad/,Science,2025-07-29 11:40:12-04:00,Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern propose merger to create nation's first transcontinental railroad,13,1095,2025-07-29 17:15:20.714055,103,21,0,2,9,0,"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger worth $85 billion could create 1st transcontinental railroad 00:25 Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country. The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia. The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage. The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week. Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic. Pressure on remaining railroads If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times. There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered. Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal. Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly. ""It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,"" Vena told investors Tuesday. From 30 to 6 U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide. Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year. Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC , but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago. Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry. That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East. ""We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,"" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved. Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad. There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads. On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs. Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause.

Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

A lawyer for the man, Julien Giraud Jr., asked a federal judge Sunday to toss the indictment or bar Habba or any assistants acting under her authority from exercising prosecutorial powers in the case. He argues that Habba's appointment Thursday to serve as the acting U.S. attorney in New Jersey violates the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, and said that a district court's decision appointing her then-deputy , Desiree Leigh Grace, to temporarily fill the role as the state's top prosecutor is legally controlling. Giraud is ""facing an imminent criminal trial proceeding under questionable legal authority,"" under Habba, his attorney Thomas Mirigliano wrote in the motion. Mirigliano argued that Habba's reappointment after her nomination to become New Jersey's U.S. attorney is also unconstitutional. Politico first reported the request stemming from Habba's position. ""By circumventing the constitutionally mandated appointment procedures, and encroaching upon judicial powers explicitly granted by statute, the executive branch has exceeded its lawful authority,"" he wrote, adding that allowing the prosecution of his client to proceed under the current landscape ""would endorse an unconstitutional executive usurpation of judicial authority."" The filing from Giraud is the latest twist in Habba's tenure as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, which came to a head last week as she neared the end of her limited term serving temporarily in the role. Federal law restricted Habba's time in the post to 120 days, unless the federal district court in the state extended her tenure or she won Senate confirmation. But New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination, making it highly unlikely it would advance through the upper chamber. Last week, judges on the district court in New Jersey invoked a rarely used authority when they declined to keep Habba in her role of interim U.S. attorney as her 120-day term was set to expire. In her place, the judges selected the No. 2 in the New Jersey U.S. Attorney's Office, Desiree Leigh Grace, to serve as U.S. attorney for the state until another candidate for the job was nominated by Mr. Trump and confirmed by the Senate. But after the district court's decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, a career prosecutor in the office. Grace said she intended to still serve in the role, sparking confusion over who was leading the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Garden State. The White House then pulled Habba's nomination to serve as the top prosecutor, a Justice Department official said, as part of a multi-part scheme to keep her temporarily in charge of the office. Following the withdrawal and firing, Habba was appointed first assistant U.S. attorney, Grace's job before her removal, which cleared the way for her to temporarily fill the spot of U.S. attorney in New Jersey under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. The vacancies law limits Habba's time in the position to 210 days from when the vacancy occurred. Because New Jersey federal judges have a conflict of interest in the Giraud's case due to the order to remove Habba and appoint Grace, Mirigliano's motion has been assigned to Pennsylvania Judge Matthew Brann, who was appointed to the federal district court by President Barack Obama in 2012. Grace has not indicated whether or not she would challenge Habba's control of the office and seek to enforce the judges' order authorizing her appointment.

An additional 59,000 images and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to Tea. Tea lets women share information about their dates and run background checks on potential matches, among other things. Ted Miracco, CEO at mobile security maker Approov, urged users to exhibit caution in sharing personal information on widely downloaded apps.. ""A lot of people presume that if an app is available through Apple or Google, that it's safe. That's the first mistake consumers make,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Miracco also said Tea lacked adequate security protections. ""This is basic cybersecurity and something the company should be held accountable for,"" he said. ""They rushed to market and promised consumers to create a safe site, and instead they exposed them."""

In a new conference Tuesday in Columbia, South Carolina, Carr's parents said they wanted to bring awareness to the rare but often fatal brain infection caused by the Naegleria fowleri organism. The infection, called primary amebic meningoencephalitis, or PAM, occurs when water is forced up the nose and is able to cross into the brain, which can happen during recreational freshwater activities . ""This is a very tough situation,"" said Clarence Carr, Jaysen's father. ""We're doing the best that we can, but just understand, we do not want this to happen to anyone else. We're here to raise public awareness and go from there."" @cbsnews ♬ original sound - cbsnews Jaysen's mother Ebony Carr, who was wearing her son's all-state champion headband, said the family is still in shock about what happened. ""Had we known the risk of him swimming in that lake, nobody would have ever chosen to get in.

Chase Childers, who was briefly signed by the Baltimore Orioles, entered the water around 4:45 p.m. to help a group of four or five swimmers as they struggled against the current off Pawleys Island, a coastal town roughly 45 minutes south of Myrtle Beach by car, according to the Pawleys Island Police Department. ""He died trying to save others,"" the police department said of Childers, who had gone into the ocean with another person. Childers was the only swimmer missing when authorities arrived at the scene, according to police. Around 6:15 p.m., after a search by officers, fire officials and members of the U.S. Coast Guard, his body was recovered. Childers was a Major League Baseball player drafted to the Baltimore Orioles in 2009, according to the league . He went on to play minor league baseball before later serving for several years as a police officer in Cobb County, Georgia, according to a GoFundMe campaign created to support Childers' family. Rip currents are powerful channels of water that flow rapidly and are often seen along all coasts of the United States, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration writes on its website , noting that these currents can move at speeds of up to 8 feet per second. Swimmers risk drowning when they fight against rip currents while trying to return to shore, according to NOAA. The National Weather Service warns that they are the deadliest and most common hazard swimmers face in waters off North and South Carolina. ""The Town is saddened by the report of the drowning over the weekend. We pray for the family members and offer our condolences,"" wrote Pawleys Island Mayor Brian Henry in a social media post , acknowledging reports that suggested a rip current caused the drowning. He said the town ""urges caution when entering the water at any time and alertness of the ocean's currents, particularly during high surf."" A town council in Pawleys Island will evaluate ways to reduce the risks of future drownings, including by educating tourists about rip currents and the potential threats they pose, Henry added. ""While Pawleys Island beaches are consistently rated as some of the best on the entire East Coast, we would like them to be known as the safest as well,"" he added.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-transcontinental-railroad/,U.S.,2025-07-29 11:40:12-04:00,Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern propose merger to create nation's first transcontinental railroad,13,1095,2025-07-29 17:15:21.514432,103,21,0,2,9,0,"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger worth $85 billion could create 1st transcontinental railroad 00:25 Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country. The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia. The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage. The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week. Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic. Pressure on remaining railroads If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times. There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered. Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal. Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly. ""It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,"" Vena told investors Tuesday. From 30 to 6 U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide. Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year. Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC , but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago. Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry. That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East. ""We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,"" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved. Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad. There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads. On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs. Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.

That won't happen this week, economists say.",16,1064,2025-07-29 17:15:21.610424,119,22,8,3,11,0,"Breaking down dispute between Trump and Powell 02:23 During a meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a ""very simple"" request: ""Interest rates have to come down."" That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision on Wednesday. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation. Mr. Trump has for months derided Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a building renovation at the Fed could be grounds for firing. Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite. ""With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,"" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note. In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low. However, the Consumer Price Index — a key gauge for tracking inflation — in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher. Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know. When is the Fed making its rate cut decision? The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook. Who makes decisions on interest rates? The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy. Lately, at least two members of the FOMC — Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates. ""[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,"" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. ""From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink."" Could the Fed cut rates on Wednesday? It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut. For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that second-quarter GDP rose by 1.8%, below 2024's 2.8% rate. With economic clouds on the horizon, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note. Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation. ""Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,"" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email. How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump? Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment. Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about replacing him as Fed chair , he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,"" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy. When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates? The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut. Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%. ""With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,"" Daco said. ""We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.""

Here's what to know.,18,794,2025-07-29 17:15:21.935423,116,22,7,3,11,0,"Why a court struck down most of Trump's tariffs 05:49 The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval. A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday announced a pact , easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China. What both sides are arguing The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal basis for imposing his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of tariffs in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl . ""This case is about more than high tariffs,"" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress."" IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs. ""It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' — and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years"" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case. The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. ""The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. Why the case is important Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an ""unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States."" But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said. ""If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals — just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,"" Schwab said in an email. Presidents can draw on other statutes , such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs. How we got here The U.S. Court of International Trade in May struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs , with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded ""any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs."" At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May blocked the trade court ruling and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed. After the trade court ruling in May, Desai said Mr. Trump would use ""all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans."" The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch. That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court . Tariffs"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-recommendations-measure-obesity-bmi/,Health,2025-01-15 12:32:21-05:00,New recommendations to measure obesity go beyond controversial BMI. A doctor explains.,12,537,2025-07-29 17:15:22.050565,118,22,4,3,11,0,"New recommendations to measure obesity 03:26 Body mass index , or BMI, has long been criticized as a flawed method for measuring obesity — and now a group of experts is sharing new recommendations. BMI is a formula that uses a person's height and weight ratio to assess whether they're underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese, although it is not a direct measure of body fat. In the report, published Tuesday in The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology journal , more than 50 experts proposed a new way for medical professionals to define and diagnose obesity that puts less emphasis on BMI. ""So what that means is, do you actually have excess fat?"" Gounder said, explaining there are three main ways to measure that. 1. Waist circumference, or a waist to hip ratio: ""So if your waist is over 35 inches for a woman or 40 inches for a man, that means you do have excess fat, or are you apple-shaped versus pear-shaped?"" Gounder said. 2. Directly measuring body fat: ""Some older women might be familiar with a DEXA test to assess for bone thinning or osteoporosis. That can also be used to measure body fat,"" Gounder said. 3. Effects on your daily living activities: ""Can you climb up and down stairs? If you're not able to because of your weight, that would be clinically obese,"" she said. ""Do you see damage to your organs, your kidneys, your heart, et cetera because of your obesity? That would be clinical obesity."" The updated recommendations were endorsed by 76 organizations worldwide, including scientific societies and patient advocacy groups, the authors of the report said, though it's not clear how widely or quickly they could be put into practice. The report acknowledges that shifting to these recommendations will bring both cost and workforce challenges. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , BMI is an ""inexpensive and easy screening method"" that is ""strongly correlated"" with weight-related medical conditions. But in recent years, BMI has come increasingly under fire with critics denouncing the method as not just unreliable but sexist and racist . ""BMI is really looking at how much do you weigh relative to your height. But not every, say, six foot man who has the same weight is obese versus healthy. Some of them may actually be strapping, muscular guys versus somebody who is truly overweight or obese. So we're trying to distinguish between this,"" Gounder said. For example, many professional athletes are considered clinically obese based on the BMI scale, because it cannot distinguish the weight of muscle from the weight of fat. Obesity Weight Loss"

For many Americans, Social Security is a financial lifeline during retirement, but it's also one that pays out higher amounts if you can wait longer to claim it. Yet despite this built-in incentive, a surprising number of people still file early. According to recent data, more Americans are now claiming Social Security benefits at age 62 , the earliest possible age, a decision that can lock in significantly smaller monthly checks for life. Case in point? Your monthly payments increase by about 8% for every year you delay benefits past your full retirement age until age 70. That type of guaranteed return is hard to beat, especially in today's market, so why do people claim their Social Security benefits early? In many cases, it's out of necessity . Things like job loss, rising living costs or unexpected emergencies can push retirees-to-be into relying on Social Security sooner than they'd planned, especially if they're behind on their retirement savings and investing goals . And in today's uncertain economic climate, with inflation remaining sticky and housing costs still high, those types of pressures aren't letting up. However, there are ways you can reduce the chances of needing to dip into Social Security earlier than planned. By using these tools, you can buy yourself more time and lock in a larger monthly benefit down the road. Find out how to secure a reliable annuity income stream during retirement . 3 ways to avoid dipping into Social Security early The following strategies could help you avoid the early Social Security filing trap. Invest in the right annuity One of the most effective ways to bridge the income gap before claiming Social Security is investing in an immediate or deferred income annuity . Think of an annuity as creating your own personal pension. When buying one, you make either a lump sum payment or series of payments to an insurance company, and in return, they guarantee you monthly income for life or a specified period. The beauty of this strategy lies in timing and tax efficiency . If you purchase a deferred annuity in your early 60s, you can set it to begin payments at age 65 or 67, creating a bridge until you're ready to claim Social Security at 70. This approach is particularly powerful because annuity payments are partially tax-free, as you're getting back some of your own principal. And, delaying Social Security means your eventual benefits will be significantly higher and potentially push you into a lower tax bracket overall. Note, though, that annuities can differ vastly from one option to the next, so it's important to do your research and choose the type and payout structure that aligns with your timeline, risk tolerance and other retirement income sources. Working with a financial advisor or annuity expert who understands the nuances of annuity products can help you find the right option to support your Social Security strategy. Explore your annuity options and lock in a top rate today . Supplement your income with a reverse mortgage loan If you're a homeowner aged 62 or older who has a substantial amount of home equity, a reverse mortgage could give you the financial breathing room you need to delay tapping your Social Security benefits. With a reverse mortgage, you borrow against the equity you've built in your home and receive the funds as a lump sum, monthly payments, a line of credit or a combination of these options. Taking out a line of credit via a reverse mortgage is often most strategic because unused credit actually grows over time, giving you an expanding financial safety net. And, unlike traditional home equity loans, your reverse mortgage loan proceeds don't have to be repaid until you sell the home, move out or die. There are also federal protections in place so you'll never owe more than the home is worth, even if the market shifts. So, when used strategically, a reverse mortgage can be an efficient way to lock down a retirement income source , especially if your home has appreciated in value and you want to stay in place. That said, reverse mortgages aren't the right solution for everyone. They come with fees, reduce your home equity and can complicate things for your heirs. But for retirees who want to stay in their homes and avoid filing for Social Security before they're eligible for the maximum benefits, they're worth considering, particularly as home prices stay high or continue to climb in many markets. Find out how a reverse mortgage could benefit you in retirement . Maximize contributions to your tax-advantaged retirement accounts If you're 50 or older, you can make catch-up contributions that significantly boost your retirement savings. The strategy involves front-loading these accounts in your late 50s and early 60s, and then using systematic withdrawals to fund your lifestyle while your Social Security benefits grow. While maximizing contributions to 401(k)s, IRAs, and health savings accounts (HSAs) in your final working years requires advanced planning, it can be incredibly powerful, as you can use these funds strategically in early retirement. For example, you might withdraw from traditional IRAs and 401(k)s first while paying ordinary income tax and then transition to Roth accounts before finally claiming maximized Social Security benefits. This creates a tax-efficient withdrawal sequence that can extend your money significantly. For 2025, you can contribute up to $31,000 to a 401(k) and $8,000 to an IRA when including catch-up contributions at or after age 50. HSAs are particularly valuable because they're triple tax-advantaged and can be used for any purpose after age 65, though it's worth noting that non-medical withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income. The bottom line Delaying Social Security isn't always easy, and while it may be tempting to claim Social Security as soon as you're eligible, especially when money is tight or retirement feels just out of reach, doing so often means settling for smaller monthly checks that can stretch thin over time. Fortunately, with some smart planning, you can give yourself the flexibility to wait, whether that means investing in the right annuity, tapping into home equity through a reverse mortgage or focusing heavily on your tax-advantaged retirement accounts. By utilizing one or more of these strategies, you'll be in a stronger position to make the most of your benefits and your retirement."
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trumps-trade-tariffs-international-court-federal-circuit/,U.S.,2025-07-29 13:47:01-04:00,This lawsuit in court this week could throw a wrench in Trump's trade policy. Here's what to know.,18,794,2025-07-29 17:15:22.272444,116,22,7,3,11,0,"Why a court struck down most of Trump's tariffs 05:49 The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval. A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday announced a pact , easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China. What both sides are arguing The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal basis for imposing his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of tariffs in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl . ""This case is about more than high tariffs,"" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress."" IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs. ""It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' — and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years"" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case. The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. ""The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. Why the case is important Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an ""unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States."" But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said. ""If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals — just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,"" Schwab said in an email. Presidents can draw on other statutes , such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs. How we got here The U.S. Court of International Trade in May struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs , with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded ""any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs."" At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May blocked the trade court ruling and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed. After the trade court ruling in May, Desai said Mr. Trump would use ""all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans."" The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch. That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court . Tariffs"

Asked about a tariff rate ""for the world,"" as Mr. Trump put it, the president responded, ""I would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range."" The U.S. president made the remarks seated alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland , as Mr. Trump visits his golf courses there and meets with European leaders. The U.S. and U.K. have already reached a trade agreement, and over the weekend, after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders announced a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU. A Trump administration deadline of Aug. 1 for other countries to reach trade deals with the U.S. is rapidly approaching. Without an individual deal, Mr. Trump says most countries' products will see a flat tariff rate. ""I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%,"" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding, ""probably one of those two numbers."" But as recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump floated a higher range, between 15% and 50%. Mr. Trump, who in April said the U.S. had 200 trade deals with other nations, has since said there are too many countries for individual trade deals with all of them and the U.S. will have ""simple"" tariffs for ""most"" countries. ""We have over 200 countries, people don't realize, that's a lot of, that's a lot of deals ... that would be too much for anybody,"" the president said Wednesday. Tariffs are paid for by the importing business to the U.S. government, and are not directly paid by a foreign company's government or company. Companies may pass along those higher expenses to U.S. consumers."

""The gut and brain (connection) is really new burgeoning scientific work that's come out over the last couple of decades — although Hippocrates eons ago spoke about it,"" she says. ""But what we understand is that the gut and brain arise from the exact same cells in the human embryo, so they are connected even from our early development. Then they are connected by the vagus nerve throughout our lives."" The vagus nerve is our 10th cranial nerve, which she describes as a ""text messaging system between the brain and the gut, sending messages all the time — communicating chemical messages."" One of the things that affects these chemical messages? The food we eat. ""On days that we're eating those healthier foods, they are nurturing and taking care of the good microbes in the gut,"" Naidoo says, whereas when we eat processed and fast foods, the ""bad microbes are taken care of,"" upsetting the balance in the gut. How to support the gut-brain connection through food One of the best things you can do support your ""food-mood"" connection is to clean up your diet, Naidoo says, starting off with fiber. Naidoo explains fiber is ""extremely important for the gut microbes, because that's what helps them thrive."" She suggests getting fiber from elements of the Mediterranean diet or a plant-rich diet with vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, legumes and healthy whole grains. ""You can't actually get fiber from animal sources of protein, so lean into those veggies,"" she says, pointing to clean proteins as a good option and healthy fats like omega-3 fatty acids. If you're plant-based, you can get a short chain omega-3s from chia seeds and flax seeds. The bottom line: Lean into healthy, whole foods. ""Think about eating the whole orange — skip the store-bought orange juice, which has a ton of added sugars,"" she says, adding that the ""standard American diet"" is shortened to ""SAD"" for a reason.

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote. Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to ""ensure accuracy and fairness,"" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create ""security risks and undermines the integrity of the process."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.""

The new feature is intended to protect young teens from harmful content, the company says. Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool will be able to assess a person's age based on the types of videos they've watched, the categories of the videos, and how long the person has had their account — regardless of the birthday associated with it, James Beser, director of product management at YouTube , said in a statement on the platform's blog. If the technology identifies a person as under 18, it will take extra steps to regulate their content by disabling personalized advertising and limiting repetitive views of certain kinds of content, among other things. If YouTube incorrectly determines someone's age, the user can upload a form of identification to fix the error. ""We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users,"" YouTube said in the blog post. Google, which is the parent company of YouTube, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. According to a recent Pew survey , YouTube is the most popular social media app among teens. Ninety percent of teens ages 13 to 17 said they used YouTube last year, compared with 63% who said they used TikTok. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan initially announced the age-detection technology in February . The new tool builds on other safety features like supervised accounts which allow parents to monitor their children's YouTube activity more closely. YouTube has also leveraged AI to identify and remove content it considers harmful, although since President Trump took office in January for his second term, the social media platform has shifted its policy to emphasize ""freedom of expression"" over safety, The New York Times reported . YouTube says it will be testing the age-detection tool in the coming weeks among a small set of U.S. users, before rolling out the technology to a wider audience.

In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management — the government's human resources arm — said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in ""communal religious expressions"" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states. ""During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,"" it states. ""However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request."" The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer. According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech — for example, they can ""require that employees perform official work while on duty,"" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be ""harassing in nature."" Still, staff ""must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,"" the office said. The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can ""discuss their religious views with one another"" and ""may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views"" — but they ""must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop."" For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers ""who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome."" ""Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,"" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement . ""This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths."" Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should ""adopt a generous approach"" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons. In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive ""anti-Christian weaponization of government."" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias. The moves have drawn pushback . The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo ""outrageous and unconstitutional,"" arguing the guidance ""purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing."" ""These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,"" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement."

The parent company of brands like Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot announced the projected earnings hit as Mr. Trump clinches deals with U.S. trade partners that include steep tariffs on U.S. imports. Stellantis expects most of the earnings decline to materialize in the second half of 2025. ""Stellantis updates its estimate of 2025 net tariff impact to approximately €1.5 billion, of which €0.3 billion was incurred in H1 2025. The Company remains highly engaged with relevant policymakers, while continuing long-term scenario planning,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday as it reported financial results for the first half of 2025. The automaker acknowledged that Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts to the U.S. are hurting its business , particularly in North America. Stellantis builds its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles in factories in Canada and Mexico, meaning they're subject to the new levies. While Mr. Trump's deal with the EU, calling for 15% tariffs across the board will make BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles more expensive for U.S. consumers, according to analysts. Stellantis is largely unaffected by the EU agreement. ""Stellantis isn't much affected by the EU/US tariff news — the question for STLA is if the Detroit-3 will want to renegotiate the [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)] tariff after the EU and Japan got a better deal,"" UBS analysts said in a research note. Other automobile manufacturers, including General Motors , have been bracing for impact from tariffs. GM CEO Mary Barra said the company took a $1.1 billion hit from tariffs in the second quarter, and that the company is taking steps to reduce its tariff exposure by investing in U.S. assembly plants. European automaker Volkswagen also said last week that tariffs cost the company $1.5 billion in the first half of 2025."

The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, ""the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,"" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division. ""What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space.

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California carrying seven satellites, including NASA's twin TRACERS probes, SpaceX Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new ""polylingual"" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols. Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the ""radiation budget,"" and another that will focus on how high-energy ""killer electrons"" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere. Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental ""cubesat"" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world. The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg. The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad. A camera mounted on the Falcon 9's second stage shows the reusable first stage falling away and heading back to landing at Vandenberg, SpaceX's 27th booster recovery in California and its 479th overall. SpaceX A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch. Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later. TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind ""couples"" with Earth's magnetic field. ""So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,"" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa. ""And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.""

With two identical satellites, scientists expect to measure rapid changes in the near-Earth space environment as the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field. NASA That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays , ""but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that."" ""So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,"" Miles said. The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols. The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs. The first of two TRACERS satellites is released to fly on its own. (SpaceX) SpaceX Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space. Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites. The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator. ""The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,"" she said. ""These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction."" The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, ""it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them."" What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which ""could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.""

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause. First lady Melania Trump, President Donald Trump, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife Leena Al Ashqar watch the second half of the Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Sunday, July 13, 2025. Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

Here's what we know about the investigation.,18,1465,2025-07-29 17:15:23.396347,121,26,9,5,11,1,"What's known about the investigation, suspect in NYC office building shooting 03:21 Four people were killed in a shooting Monday evening inside a New York City office building. The gunman, who used a high-powered rifle to open fire in the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three civilians. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition. Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on ""CBS Mornings,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place. The tower at 345 Park Ave. contains offices for several other major corporations, including the accounting firm KPMG and the investment company Blackstone . President Trump said in a social media post that he had been briefed on the shooting, which he called ""tragic"" and ""a senseless act of violence."" Here's what we know so far about the incident and the investigation. What happened? Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle. The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program. Surveillance footage shows the gunman exiting his black BMW on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building . The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner. The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting to take to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices for the building's owner Rudin Management are located. The commissioner said he ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" and struck one of the victims who eventually died. At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said. The victims Didarul had two young sons and his wife is currently pregnant, Adams said at a news conference Monday night, praising him for his service on the police force and his character. ""He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city,"" Adams said. ""And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about."" In a statement, the NYPD said Didarul ""represented the very best of our department."" The three civilians killed in the shooting include the second security guard in the lobby and employees at Rudin Management and Blackstone. The security guard was identified as Aland Etienne. He was an unarmed security guard working for McLane Security Inc., according to 32BJ SEIU, a union representing property service workers. He had been in his role at the building on Park Avenue since 2019. In a statement, Blackstone identified one of the victims killed as their employee Wesley LePatner . ""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed,"" the statement said. ""She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email Monday night that someone working for the league ""was seriously injured"" in the shooting. Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable. The suspect Police have shared preliminary details about Tamura, but a number of questions remained Tuesday. It appeared he had attempted to target the NFL offices located inside the Park Avenue tower but used the wrong elevator, and ended up on a different floor, Adams said. He told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday that the shooter had a note on his person that referenced CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. ""He did have a note on him,"" Adams said. ""The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury."" Tamura never played in the NFL, but local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appear to show he played high school football. He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas. Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work Sunday when he failed to show up. Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon. That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found. Parts of the gun used in the shooting were purchased by an associate of the gunman in Las Vegas, the NYPD spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear how he got the other parts to assemble the rifle or why the associate had to purchase some for him. A team of NYPD detectives has located the associate in Las Vegas and is interviewing him. The NYPD also plans to execute a search warrant on the gunman's home, the spokesperson said. The shooter did purchase the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the spokesperson said. ""A violent, despicable attack"" Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting. Adams on Monday described it as ""a violent, despicable attack,"" adding, ""No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""a horrific act of violence"" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States. ""The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,"" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms ""only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder."" ""The time to act is now,"" Hochul continued. ""The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen."" Shooting New York City"

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials. The photos were the first from inside the main structural support called the pedestal in the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel, an area directly under the reactor's core.

Here's why researchers are concerned,13,1377,2025-07-29 17:15:23.555654,105,22,1,2,9,0,"Inside the debate over teens using AI companions for support 04:11 No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence . The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party. The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. ""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking."" For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you."" More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are ""everywhere in teens' lives."" Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships. ""Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,"" Steyer said. ""They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings."" As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified."" All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. ""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people."" How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. ""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it."" Artificial Intelligence"

The new feature is intended to protect young teens from harmful content, the company says. Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool will be able to assess a person's age based on the types of videos they've watched, the categories of the videos, and how long the person has had their account — regardless of the birthday associated with it, James Beser, director of product management at YouTube , said in a statement on the platform's blog. If the technology identifies a person as under 18, it will take extra steps to regulate their content by disabling personalized advertising and limiting repetitive views of certain kinds of content, among other things. If YouTube incorrectly determines someone's age, the user can upload a form of identification to fix the error. ""We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users,"" YouTube said in the blog post. Google, which is the parent company of YouTube, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. According to a recent Pew survey , YouTube is the most popular social media app among teens. Ninety percent of teens ages 13 to 17 said they used YouTube last year, compared with 63% who said they used TikTok. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan initially announced the age-detection technology in February . The new tool builds on other safety features like supervised accounts which allow parents to monitor their children's YouTube activity more closely.

The deadline for applications to the program is midnight Friday. With those deferred resignations, NASA's civil servant workforce would shrink from about 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. This figure also includes about 500 employees who were lost through normal attrition, the agency said. ""Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,"" NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner said in a statement. According to NASA, about 870 employees applied to leave during the first round of the Deferred Resignation Program, and about 3,000 employees during the second round. The deferred resignation program was a buyout program introduced across the federal government by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the onset of the Trump administration in an effort to slash costs and reduce the size of the federal workforce. A White House budget proposal issued in May would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18 billion. NASA has also been roiled by a leadership crisis in recent months. In December, President Trump nominated billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman, a friend of former DOGE head Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator. Musk's SpaceX has several NASA contracts . However, in late May, Mr. Trump pulled Isaacman's nomination just ahead of the Senate confirmation vote, which was followed days later by a public fallout between Mr. Trump and Musk. Earlier this month, the president announced that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy would temporarily lead the agency. Trump Administration NASA"

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials. The photos were the first from inside the main structural support called the pedestal in the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel, an area directly under the reactor's core.

In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management — the government's human resources arm — said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in ""communal religious expressions"" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states. ""During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,"" it states. ""However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request."" The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer. According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech — for example, they can ""require that employees perform official work while on duty,"" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be ""harassing in nature."" Still, staff ""must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,"" the office said. The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can ""discuss their religious views with one another"" and ""may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views"" — but they ""must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop."" For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers ""who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome."" ""Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,"" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement . ""This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths."" Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should ""adopt a generous approach"" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons. In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive ""anti-Christian weaponization of government."" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias. The moves have drawn pushback . The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo ""outrageous and unconstitutional,"" arguing the guidance ""purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing."" ""These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,"" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement."

It's one of the Caribbean country's biggest seizures in history, said Carlos Devers, spokesperson for the country's Anti-Drug Agency. Authorities began pursuing a speedboat heading towards the island with several people on board after determining it to be suspicious, local news outlet Acento reported . Helicopters, boats and cars were involved in the chase, which began Monday off the country's south coast near Pedernales. It ended with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian, Devers said. Image released by the National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) shows the speedboat. National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) Inside the 35-foot boat were 53 bales of plastic packages, totaling 1,536 individually wrapped bags of suspected cocaine, authorities said. Authorities also seized items including a cellphone, 13 jerrycans of fuel, a small cooler filled with water and food, and a backpack with a change of clothes. The Dominican Republic has long been considered a major drug transit point, with some of the shipments bound for Europe. The largest seizure in the country's history happened last year in December when authorities seized nearly 9.5 tons of cocaine worth $250 million. Overall, officials seized more than 46 tons of drugs last year. The second biggest seizure was reported in 2006, with 2.8 tons of cocaine found at Caucedo port.

Job listings for the kind of entry-level corporate roles traditionally available to young grads have declined 15%, while the number of applications per job has surged 30%, according to data from Handshake, a career platform geared toward Gen Z workers. Although people fresh out of college often struggle to land entry-level positions in their chosen field, ""there are early warning signs"" that AI is taking jobs away from the least experienced workers, Doug Calidas, senior vice president of government affairs for Americans for Responsible Innovation, a nonprofit focused on emerging technologies, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""The unemployment rate for recent college graduates being unusually high seems relevant,"" he said. As of March, the U.S. unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 through 27 was 5.8%, considerably higher than the nation's overall 4% jobless rate at the time, according to the New York Federal Reserve. To be sure, most recent college grads are finding work, Calidas emphasized, adding that the latest job figures point to a ""deterioration,"" not a collapse, in opportunities for young people. Still, ""It's tough for students who feel like they have done the right thing their whole lives — they went into STEM careers or computer science because they expected software hiring to grow and grow, and that may not happen,"" he said. Just ask Michael Macaluso, 22, who this year earned a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Connecticut. Despite applying for roughly 200 positions, he has yet to land a job in his chosen field. For now, he's working as an assistant pool director at the Lake Isle Country Club in Eastchester, New York, his hometown. AI redefining the entry-level job Experts say that because AI is currently best at the kind of rote, repetitive tasks that are a staple of entry-level work, the very nature of what such roles consist of is likely to change. ""The AI piece is becoming more integrated, which is requiring a redefinition of what an entry-level role looks like and the types of skills that might be be needed,"" Christine Cruzvergara, chief education strategy officer at Handshake, told CBS MoneyWatch. ""So it's critical for new graduates to make sure they are exposing themselves to AI and learning how to use it."" Over the past two years, there has been a 400% increase in employers using ""AI"" in job descriptions, according to Handshake. Liya Palagashvili, a labor economist at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, told CBS MoneyWatch that jobs with low barriers to entry are being swallowed by AI. She points to a 2024 study by researchers at the University of Chicago, Columbia Business School, Purdue University, and Stanford Graduate School of Business showing that generative AI is weighing on hiring in occupations that require little education, knowledge or training. ""Any job requiring lower levels or skills or training, that's where we are seeing a reduction in hiring due to an exposure to generative AI,"" Palagashvili said. By contrast, the study found that, since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for workers in occupations requiring a higher level of knowledge and training has risen. ""So you're seeing a two-segmented market thing going on with ChatGPT having a positive effect on occupations with higher barriers to labor entry, and having a negative effect on occupations that have low barriers to entry,"" Palagashvili said. ""The latest empirical evidence shows hiring is down in low-skilled occupations, but high in those that require a higher skill level."" New technologies have always shaped the labor market, snuffing out certain professions while breathing life into new sectors. One difference with the rise of AI that the technology excels at job functions typically associated with white-collar work. The acceleration of AI could push more young people into skilled trades that don't require a high-priced college education, Calidas said. ""Since the automation that began in the 1970s, a lot of manual jobs have gone away,"" he said. ""For a few generations, it's been an article of faith that white-collar jobs are more safe, whereas blue-collar work is more precarious. There's been a cultural push toward sending people to college, but it might make more sense to go into the trades."" Artificial Intelligence"

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California carrying seven satellites, including NASA's twin TRACERS probes, SpaceX Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new ""polylingual"" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols. Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the ""radiation budget,"" and another that will focus on how high-energy ""killer electrons"" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere. Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental ""cubesat"" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world. The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg. The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad. A camera mounted on the Falcon 9's second stage shows the reusable first stage falling away and heading back to landing at Vandenberg, SpaceX's 27th booster recovery in California and its 479th overall. SpaceX A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch. Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later. TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind ""couples"" with Earth's magnetic field. ""So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,"" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa. ""And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.""

""So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,"" Miles said. The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols. The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs. The first of two TRACERS satellites is released to fly on its own. (SpaceX) SpaceX Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space. Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites. The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator. ""The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,"" she said. ""These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction."" The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, ""it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them."" What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which ""could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.""

""It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,"" economists with investment bank Société Générale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation."" The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast. EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.) The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028. The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration. ""This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,"" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet about the pact. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Reducing uncertainty Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports . More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week — both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff — also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said. ""[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,"" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Société Générale, told CBS MoneyWatch. European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products. Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a statement on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters. ""We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,"" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the deal ""at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market."" According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April. Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits. ""Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.

Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ai-digital-friendship-with-teens-common-sense-media-study/,Health,2025-07-23 20:28:00-04:00,More teens say they're using AI for friendship. Here's why researchers are concerned,13,1377,2025-07-29 17:15:24.714694,105,22,1,2,9,0,"Inside the debate over teens using AI companions for support 04:11 No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence . The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party. The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. ""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking."" For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you."" More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are ""everywhere in teens' lives."" Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships. ""Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,"" Steyer said. ""They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings."" As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified."" All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. ""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people."" How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. ""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it."" Artificial Intelligence"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,Science,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:24.809515,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"

That won't happen this week, economists say.",16,1064,2025-07-29 17:15:24.907468,119,22,8,3,11,0,"Breaking down dispute between Trump and Powell 02:23 During a meeting last week between President Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, the president sought to underscore what he said is a ""very simple"" request: ""Interest rates have to come down."" That wish isn't likely to be granted when the Fed announces its next interest rate decision on Wednesday. Economists put the probability of the central bank holding rates steady at 96%, according to FactSet. The Fed has maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5% since December 2024, prior to Mr. Trump's second-term inauguration in January, as policy makers try to douse the flickering embers of inflation. Mr. Trump has for months derided Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs, which experts say would boost economic growth but could cause consumer prices to flare. Upping the pressure, Trump administration officials also have said the Fed chair's handline of a building renovation at the Fed could be grounds for firing. Despite such criticism, Powell has maintained his stance that no immediate rate cuts are necessary given that the economy remains solid. The Fed chair, who Mr. Trump nominated to head the central bank in 2017, has also suggested he wants to keep its powder dry in case the Trump administration's steep new tariffs cause inflation to reignite. ""With the labor market holding up and the impact of tariffs on inflation starting to rear its ugly head, the Federal Reserve has plenty of ammunition to justify keeping interest rates unchanged at the July meeting,"" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet said in a July 24 research note. In making his case for lowering interest rates, Mr. Trump has pointed to rate cuts earlier this year by the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, while also pointing out that U.S. inflation so far in 2025 has remained relatively low. However, the Consumer Price Index — a key gauge for tracking inflation — in June rose to an annualized rate of 2.7%, well above the Fed's 2% annual target and a sign that that tariffs could be pushing some prices higher. Fed policy makers are meeting this week to discuss what to do on interest rates. Here's what to know. When is the Fed making its rate cut decision? The Federal Reserve will make its next rate cut decision at 2 p.m. ET on Wednesday, July 30, followed by a 2:30 p.m. ET press conference with Powell, when he will offer his view on the the state of the economy and answer questions from financial journalists about the Fed's economic outlook. Who makes decisions on interest rates? The decision is made by the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, with a voting majority deciding whether the central bank should cut, hike or maintain the benchmark rate. In other words, no single person, including Fed Chair Powell, determines the central bank's monetary policy. Lately, at least two members of the FOMC — Federal Reserve governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman — have signaled their belief that it is time to cut rates. ""[I]f there were a pair of dissents in July, it would match the most since 1993,"" Sweet of Oxford Economics noted.. ""From our perspective, dissents are normal and a good thing as it highlights that the Fed isn't falling into the trap of groupthink."" Could the Fed cut rates on Wednesday? It's not impossible, but highly unlikely. Economists estimate the chances of a rate cut at just 4%, according to FactSet. CME FedWatch, a closely watched monetary policy tracker, also suggests only a very remote probability of a cut. For now, data continues to shows steady, if slowing, economic growth, with employers in June hiring more workers than forecast and inflation remaining relatively muted. Economists expect the Commerce Department on Wednesday to report that second-quarter GDP rose by 1.8%, below 2024's 2.8% rate. With economic clouds on the horizon, the Fed is expected to hold off on cutting rates to give them room to maneuver if conditions deteriorate, economists note. Interest rates are the Fed's most powerful tool for nudging growth forward when the economy slows and cooling activity when inflation jumps. A rate hike makes it more expensive for consumers and businesses to borrow, curbing spending and putting the brakes on inflation. By contrast, cuts make it cheaper to borrow, fueling spending and corporate investment, which can spark inflation. ""Policymakers remain cautious, navigating persistent inflationary risks tied to trade policy along with cooling labor market conditions and growing political pressure from the administration to accelerate rate cuts,"" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in an email. How has Powell responsed to pressure from Mr. Trump? Powell has repeatedly stated that the Federal Reserve's decisions are based solely on economic data as it pursues its dual mandate of keeping inflation low and ensuring full employment. Because Mr. Trump has been pushing for lower rates, Powell is likely to face questions at his press conference Wednesday press about political pressure. Powell may also be asked about the president's remarks about replacing him as Fed chair , he added. Powell's current term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The odds are that [Powell] sticks with his mantra that it doesn't impact monetary policy and he isn't resigning while dodging questions about a shadow Fed chair,"" Sweet said, referring to the possibility that Mr. Trump could decide to nominate Powell's successor months before he is due to step down in hopes of influencing investor expectations for monetary policy. When is the Fed more likely to lower interest rates? The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark rate at its Sept. 16-17 meeting, according to FactSet, with economists pegging the likelihood of a cut at 63%. The FOMC doesn't meet in August, making the September meeting the next chance for a rate cut. Economists who predict a rate cut at the September meeting are forecasting a 0.25 percentage point reduction, which would take the federal funds rate down to a range of 4% to 4.25%. ""With no imminent need to act.. the Fed will likely wait until September to deliver the next 25 [basis point] rate cut,"" Daco said. ""We continue to expect two rate cuts in 2025, followed by a further 100bps of easing in 2026 as economic and labor market conditions deteriorate more visibly.""

Authorities believe a landslide caused by torrential rain was likely the cause of the accident. The train derailed in a forested area on a route between Sigmaringen and Ulm in southern Germany's Baden-Württemberg state. Around 100 passengers were on board when the train hit mud and debris that had spilled onto the tracks following a landslide. Two carriages derailed and toppled down an embankment next to the tracks. A preliminary investigation suggested a hole near the line had filled with water during intense rainfall, leading a slope adjacent to the track to collapse. Rescue workers search for passengers in a derailed passenger train, which came off the rails in the Biberach district between the districts of Zweifaltendorf and Zell in southern Germany's Baden-Württemberg state, July 28, 2025. Thomas Warnack/picture alliance/Getty Weather experts said the region was inundated with up to 10 gallons of rainfall per square yard in the space of just a few hours on Sunday. The victims of the derailment were identified as the train's 32-year-old driver, a 36-year-old railway trainee and a 70-year-old male passenger. Emergency services transported at least 41 people to nearby hospitals, some of them with serious injuries, according to emergency officials. Authorities were examining data from the train's onboard data recorder to determine the exact sequence of events. Officials said there was no indication of foul play. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his condolences to the victims' families and promised full support for rescue and recovery efforts. Deutsche Bahn, the national rail operator, also issued a statement expressing shock and pledged full cooperation with investigators. Train Crash Germany"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,Entertainment,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:25.114986,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"

But what green flags, or positive traits, should singles be on the lookout for? Frankie Bashan, known as Dr. Frankie, is a clinical psychologist, board-certified sex therapist, founder of Little Gay Book and relationship expert with over 20 years of experience. She said shifting your focus from red flags to green flags can lead to more successful dating. ""You want to be looking for all this from the outset,"" she said. ""Because we're wired for survival, what do we notice? We notice the orange and red flags right away, and it often scares us, so we foreclose opportunities."" Instead, she encourages people to suspend immediate judgment and be curious. ""I'm noticing this, but I'm not going to make a definitive answer just yet. Right now, I'm just taking in information,"" she advised thinking. ""Our brains don't do it automatically. It has to be intentional."" Here are some green flags to look for. Reliability While showing up late or canceling a date last-minute may be a red flag, doing the opposite is a green flag. ""Do they commit to a date? Do they show up on time?"" Bashan said of indications someone is reliable. Trustworthiness As they share information about themselves, Bashan said you want to see if they're consistent in their stories. ""Figure out, is this somebody that is trustworthy?"" she said. Values relationships Having and valuing relationships outside of a romantic partner — like friends and family — is another green flag, according to Bashan. ""Is this person somebody who can have sustainable, long term relationships?"" she said. ""Not everybody has family that they're close to for one reason or another, but do they have chosen family? Do they have friendships that they value and that are important to them, that they invest in?"" Reciprocity Someone who's not afraid to let you know that they're interested is another green flag. ""When you're sharing about yourself, your interests, your desires for relationships, what you're looking for — they're listening,"" Bashan said. ""They're not just waiting for you to finish so that they can give a response and focusing on how they want to respond to everything. No, they're actually attentive, focused, curious about you."" Boundaries Being able to set (and respect!) boundaries is another green flag, according to Wendy Walsh, a relationship expert at the website DatingAdvice and psychology professor with a doctorate in clinical psychology. ""There's been some talk on social media about people who trauma dump on dates,"" she said, explaining this isn't the way to go. ""They think they're being open, authentic and vulnerable, but what they're really doing is disclosing too much, too soon."" Or, if your date asks you something you're uncomfortable answering on a first encounter, take note of how they respond to you setting a boundary of not sharing that part of yourself just yet. Balance of dependance A relationship is about growing both together and independently, and Walsh said it's a green flag when someone understands and demonstrates and appropriate balance. Picture a Venn diagram with the circles representing the individuals and the overlapped area representing the relationship. ""Relationships are unhealthy when the two circles completely overlap. Psychologists would call that the enmeshed. They're so enmeshed that nobody can remember whose problem is whose, and they start to control each other, and what ends up happening is the individual starts to die,"" she said. ""Now picture the two circles right beside each other, but not overlapping. And now you have individual growth, but you have no relationship security."""

In the complaint, Mizelle cites Boasberg's attendance at a Judicial Conference of the United States on March 11, in which the judge warned that the Trump administration could ""disregard rulings of federal courts"" and trigger a ""constitutional crisis."" Mizelle also cites Boasberg's handling of a case involving alleged members of Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua who were flown to a Salvadoran prison earlier this year. Boasberg ordered the planes to turn around on March 15, after the Trump administration removed the men under the Alien Enemies Act. Boasberg subsequently held hearings in the case in which he has lambasted the conduct of Justice Department attorneys and questioned whether the Trump administration is acting in good faith to guarantee due process for those it has removed from the U.S. or intends to remove. ""Throughout the proceedings, Judge Boasberg rushed the government through complex litigation, sometimes giving the Trump Administration less than 48 hours to respond and threatening criminal-contempt proceedings and the appointment of an outside prosecutor against senior Trump Administration officials for failing to comply with an order that had already been vacated,"" Mizelle wrote. Bondi wrote in a post on X that the judge's remarks ""have undermined the integrity of the judiciary, and we will not stand for that."" The complaint was addressed to the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Sri Srinivasan. Typically, complaints about judges are first reviewed by the chief judge of the appellate circuit, who can either dismiss them or refer them to a committee for investigation. After that, a council of judges decides whether to take corrective action, which can include reprimanding the judge and avoiding assigning new cases. Judges can only be removed from the bench through impeachment proceedings, which requires two-thirds of senators to vote to remove them. Earlier this year, the Trump administration filed a similar complaint against D.C. District Judge Ana Reyes for what they claimed was ""hostile and egregious misconduct"" during a hearing in February over the Trump administration's attempts to ban transgender servicemembers from the military. The D.C. Circuit has not yet addressed the Reyes complaint. Boasberg accuses Trump administration of ""obstructionism"" In April, Boasberg said there was probable cause to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its defiance of his order to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants bound for El Salvador. Dozens were put on two planes on March 15, removed to El Salvador and placed in detention at CECOT, a maximum security prison, despite an order issued by Boasberg to stop the removals and turn around the planes. Boasberg said in his April decision that the government's actions ""demonstrate a willful disregard"" for his order barring the government from transferring certain migrants into Salvadoran custody under the Alien Enemies Act, which previously had been invoked only three times in history, while the nation was at war. He accused the government of ""increasing obstructionism"" and ""stonewalling"" over its refusal to answer basic questions that aimed to resolve whether noncitizens who were removable solely under Mr. Trump's proclamation were transferred out of U.S. custody after the judge issued his order forbidding their deportation. ""Defendants provide no convincing reason to avoid the conclusion that appears obvious from the above factual recitation: that they deliberately flouted this court's written order and, separately, its oral command that explicitly delineated what compliance entailed,"" Boasberg wrote. Boasberg's handling of the case has drawn pushback from the administration. In March, Mr. Trump called the judge ""Crooked"" and called for his impeachment.

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"

Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

Tea's investigation of the incident found that app users' direct messages had been breached, along with some of their photos. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken the affected system offline,"" Tea said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The app, which has become one of Apple's most downloaded free apps , was compromised in a cyberattack that exposed members' personal information, including selfies, Tea said Friday. The hackers accessed a data storage system containing information that members had uploaded prior to February 2024, the company said. An additional 59,000 images and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to Tea. Tea lets women share information about their dates and run background checks on potential matches, among other things. Ted Miracco, CEO at mobile security maker Approov, urged users to exhibit caution in sharing personal information on widely downloaded apps.. ""A lot of people presume that if an app is available through Apple or Google, that it's safe. That's the first mistake consumers make,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Miracco also said Tea lacked adequate security protections. ""This is basic cybersecurity and something the company should be held accountable for,"" he said.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/,Politics,2025-07-29 12:51:09-04:00,"Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling — CBS News analysis",15,944,2025-07-29 17:15:25.668762,118,23,8,3,10,2,"03:57 Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly declined — and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

The new feature is intended to protect young teens from harmful content, the company says. Powered by artificial intelligence, the tool will be able to assess a person's age based on the types of videos they've watched, the categories of the videos, and how long the person has had their account — regardless of the birthday associated with it, James Beser, director of product management at YouTube , said in a statement on the platform's blog. If the technology identifies a person as under 18, it will take extra steps to regulate their content by disabling personalized advertising and limiting repetitive views of certain kinds of content, among other things. If YouTube incorrectly determines someone's age, the user can upload a form of identification to fix the error. ""We will only allow users who have been inferred or verified as over 18 to view age-restricted content that may be inappropriate for younger users,"" YouTube said in the blog post. Google, which is the parent company of YouTube, did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. According to a recent Pew survey , YouTube is the most popular social media app among teens. Ninety percent of teens ages 13 to 17 said they used YouTube last year, compared with 63% who said they used TikTok. YouTube CEO Neal Mohan initially announced the age-detection technology in February . The new tool builds on other safety features like supervised accounts which allow parents to monitor their children's YouTube activity more closely. YouTube has also leveraged AI to identify and remove content it considers harmful, although since President Trump took office in January for his second term, the social media platform has shifted its policy to emphasize ""freedom of expression"" over safety, The New York Times reported . YouTube says it will be testing the age-detection tool in the coming weeks among a small set of U.S. users, before rolling out the technology to a wider audience. The tool is already being used in other markets with success, the company states on its blog, but does not specify where. Google Artificial Intelligence YouTube"

""We are entering an entirely new economy, so the knowledge economy that we have been in for the last 50 years or so is on the way out, and a new economy is on the way in,"" Aneesh Raman, Chief Economic Opportunity Officer at LinkedIn, told CBS MoneyWatch. The impact of AI on Americans recently out of college is already visible across a range of industries and jobs, from technology and finance to media, legal fields and market research. As a result, for the first time unemployment among fresh grads recently surpassed the nation's overall jobless rate — a shift some experts attribute in part to the creeping influence of AI. ""There are signs that entry-level positions are being displaced by artificial intelligence at higher rates than the roles above them,"" said Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. With the adoption of AI at work only expected to accelerate, we asked three experts across academia, recruitment and consulting for advice on how new college grads should navigate this new normal. Here's what they said. Become fluent in AI Perhaps most important, young job-seekers start using gen-AI tools — today. ""Almost anybody in that audience, irrespective of the job that they're pursuing, will be expected to use AI with some facility right away,"" said Joseph Fuller, a professor at Harvard Business School and founder of the Managing the Future of Work project , comparing the task to learning how to use Microsoft Office for a previous generation of grads. To get the ball rolling, experts encourage those who are starting to hunt for work to familiarize themselves with the array of tools at their disposal, such as Anthropic's Claude or OpenAI's ChatGPT. That means learning how to engage with such tools beyond simply using them as a search engine. ""You want to get in a dialogue with it,"" Fuller said. ""You want to ask it to take different perspectives."" Emily Rose McRae, an analyst at research and advisory firm Gartner, said learning how to use AI apps can also be a good way to develop transferable skills. For example, asking AI to summarize documents and then validating its findings to ensure accuracy. Meanwhile, although AI can be helpful when it comes time to filling out job applications, users should proceed with caution given that recruiters can often spot AI-generated language, experts note. Nearly two-thirds of job candidates today use AI at some point in the application process, according to a report from recruitment firm Career Group Companies. ""If you're using it to write your cover letter and your resume and you did not review it, everyone can tell,"" McRae said. Another way to gain potentially valuable experience with AI, while also seeking work, is for interview practice. For example, users can ask the chatbot both to provide sample questions they might face in an interview and then rate the quality of their responses. ""If you are using it as a tool to get your own understanding of self in interviews, you're going to start being leaps ahead of everyone else,"" Raman said. Hone your soft skills Experts say that as AI surpasses humans in executing certain tasks — think actuarial math or corporate compliance, for example —more attention will shift to job candidates' so-called soft skills, such as problem solving and communication. ""You cannot outsource your thinking to AI,"" LinkedIn's Raman said. ""You have to continue to hone critical thinking and complex strategy thinking."" The focus will be less on your pedigree — where you went to school or even whether you have a college degree — he added, and more on what he calls the ""5 Cs"": curiosity, compassion, creativity, courage and communication. To improve their soft skills, Fuller encourages entry-level job candidates to work on turning what they regard as their biggest weakness into a strength. For instance, if you typically shy away from public speaking or talking in groups, push yourself to get comfortable in those situations. ""The inability to do that is going to be penalized more severely in the work of the future than it has been in the past,"" he said. The Harvard professor also suggested highlighting examples of advanced social skills directly on your resume to help paint a picture for recruiters of how you can contribute to the workplace. Choose your employer wisely Beyond skills development, experts say college grads should be thoughtful about the type of company they choose to work at, knowing that AI could drastically alter the business in the coming years. ""The most important thing, if you're a new grad, is where you work — not what you do at the place you're going to work,"" Raman told CBS MoneyWatch. He encouraged college graduates to seek out employers that are integrating AI responsibly and with respect for their workforce — as opposed to embracing it chiefly to replace people. Companies that are adapting to what is a major technological shift in real time will typically offer the best opportunities for learning and growth, Fuller said. In evaluating a prospective employer, young job candidates should try to gain an understanding of how they fit into the company's future. For example, McRae recommends asking hiring managers up front what types of investments the organization is making in its employees and what the room for growth looks like. ""What are they telling me they care about? What do career paths look like for this role like now? How do you help people develop the skills they need to become experts?"" she said. In researching companies, McRae also encouraged recent college grads to look for places that offer apprenticeship or rotational programs, which can offer ways to quickly ramp up their knowledge base, especially if traditional entry-level roles are in short supply.

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

Some may turn to powdered products marketed as hydration multipliers to help. While experts say buying hydration multipliers aren't entirely necessary, they can be useful in certain circumstances — but there are things to be aware of. ""If you're doing strenuous physical exercise for over an hour, rehydrating with electrolytes is a great idea, but be sure to drink water continuously. These supplements are supplements, not a replacement for water,"" Dowler said. Similar to sports drinks, hydration multipliers help by replenishing electrolytes to the body, which are lost when we sweat, said Dr. Scott Braunstein , chief medical officer at medicine concierge company Sollis Health. Braunstein said there are variety of products available, including electrolyte infused water, well-known drinks like Gatorade and Powerade, Pedialyte and packets and tablets that can be added to water. Experts advise checking the label before giving them a try. In particular, be mindful of caffeine, sugar and sodium levels. ""Some electrolyte products contain large amounts of sugar, which can be problematic for those with diabetes, obesity and other health conditions,"" Braunstein said. ""Also keep in mind that some products contain caffeine, which acts as a diuretic and can actually make it more difficult to rehydrate effectively."" It's also a good idea to check with your doctor before drinking these if you have any chronic diseases or take daily medications. ""Those with certain chronic conditions, especially kidney disease — since your kidneys regulate your electrolytes — high or low blood pressure or heart disease, should consult their doctor before consuming these products, as maintaining fluids and electrolytes within a specific range may be critical for their health,"" he added.

Overall losses so far in 2025 were slightly lower than the same time period in 2024, but still above long-term averages. By this time last year, overall losses were slightly higher at $155 billion, adjusted for inflation. The first half of 2024 included an earthquake in Japan on New Year's Day, coupled with severe thunderstorms in the United States that spawned more than 1,250 tornadoes. Of the $131 billion in overall losses for 2025, $80 billion was insured, which is the second-highest amount for the first half of any year since recordkeeping began in 1980. The first half of 2011 is the only year where insured losses have been higher, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami in Japan. The L.A. wildfires have been the costliest natural disaster this year and are estimated to have caused $53 billion in overall losses, with $40 billion insured. Climate change played a role in the wildfires by increasing the fire weather index conditions, making them more intense and destructive, according to scientists . ""We need to face it that the losses have been on the rise and make it clear that climate change plays an ever increasing role,"" said Tobias Grimm, chief climate scientist at Munich Re. As more people move into high-risk climate areas and weather events grow more extreme due to climate change, the damages will likely keep climbing, Grimm said. Another major global disaster in 2025 was the March 7.7-magnitude earthquake in Myanmar that killed an estimated 4,500 people and caused $12 billion in losses, very little of which was insured. Weather disasters like wildfires and storms have caused 88% of overall losses and 98% of insured losses, according to Munich Re. Earthquakes accounted for 12% of overall losses and 2% of insured losses in 2025 so far. In seven out of the last eight years, the industry has seen more than $100 billion in insured losses, Grimm said. ""Usually the second half of the year is more costly,"" he said, due to the bulk of the hurricane season starting in August and concluding in November. With hurricanes and wildfires being the costliest disasters on-record, the need to adapt and mitigate these climate impacts is necessary to address rising insurance costs, according to Grimm and other company experts. ""The best way to avoid losses is to implement effective preventive measures, such as more robust construction for buildings and infrastructure to better withstand natural disasters,"" Thomas Blunck, a member of the Board of Management of Munich Re, said in a statement. ""Such precautions can help to maintain reasonable insurance premiums, even in high-risk areas. And most importantly: to reduce future exposure, new building development should not be allowed in high-risk areas."" Wildfire Flooding Tornado Earthquake"

The parent company of brands like Chrysler, Fiat, Jeep and Peugeot announced the projected earnings hit as Mr. Trump clinches deals with U.S. trade partners that include steep tariffs on U.S. imports. Stellantis expects most of the earnings decline to materialize in the second half of 2025. ""Stellantis updates its estimate of 2025 net tariff impact to approximately €1.5 billion, of which €0.3 billion was incurred in H1 2025. The Company remains highly engaged with relevant policymakers, while continuing long-term scenario planning,"" the company said in a statement Tuesday as it reported financial results for the first half of 2025. The automaker acknowledged that Mr. Trump's 25% tariffs on imports of autos and auto parts to the U.S. are hurting its business , particularly in North America. Stellantis builds its Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep brand vehicles in factories in Canada and Mexico, meaning they're subject to the new levies. While Mr. Trump's deal with the EU, calling for 15% tariffs across the board will make BMW and Mercedes-Benz vehicles more expensive for U.S. consumers, according to analysts. Stellantis is largely unaffected by the EU agreement. ""Stellantis isn't much affected by the EU/US tariff news — the question for STLA is if the Detroit-3 will want to renegotiate the [U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)] tariff after the EU and Japan got a better deal,"" UBS analysts said in a research note. Other automobile manufacturers, including General Motors , have been bracing for impact from tariffs. GM CEO Mary Barra said the company took a $1.1 billion hit from tariffs in the second quarter, and that the company is taking steps to reduce its tariff exposure by investing in U.S. assembly plants. European automaker Volkswagen also said last week that tariffs cost the company $1.5 billion in the first half of 2025."

""Let's go. 1-2-3,"" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon. Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland. ""This has been an unbelievable development,"" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was ""truly a labor of love for him."" The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein . President Trump watches his drive after playing from the first tee to officially open the Trump International Golf Links course in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, in northern Scotland on July 29, 2025. It was mostly built around golf — and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand. Billing itself the ""Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,"" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road. Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole. Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88. ""My mother loved Scotland,"" Mr. Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. ""It's different when your mother was born here."" Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries — though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile. Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though. A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a ""focus on environmental sensitivity."" Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast — some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013. He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it — and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills ""ugly monsters"" and suggested they were part of ""the most expensive form of energy."" ""I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,"" the president said. ""If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that."" Starmer said in the U.K., ""we believe in a mix"" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables. The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012. Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening. ""Even if you play badly, it's still good,"" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. ""If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days."" Mr. Trump also found time to to praise Turnberry's renovated ballroom, which he said he'd paid lavishly to upgrade — even suggesting that he might install one like it at the White House. ""I could take this one, drop it right down there,"" Mr. Trump joked. ""And it would be beautiful."" Donald Trump Scotland"

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

Here's why researchers are concerned,13,1377,2025-07-29 17:15:26.861221,105,22,1,2,9,0,"Inside the debate over teens using AI companions for support 04:11 No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence . The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party. The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. ""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking."" For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you."" More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are ""everywhere in teens' lives."" Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships. ""Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,"" Steyer said. ""They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings."" As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified."" All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. ""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people."" How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. ""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it."" Artificial Intelligence"

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause. First lady Melania Trump, President Donald Trump, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife Leena Al Ashqar watch the second half of the Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Sunday, July 13, 2025. Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window , the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia. Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia. ""I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'"" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. ""And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything."" It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin ""wants peace."" On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12. ""There's no reason in waiting,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""We just don't see any progress being made."" Ukraine Ceasefire Politics Russia Trump Administration Vladimir Putin"

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"

Here's why researchers are concerned,13,1377,2025-07-29 17:15:27.591887,105,22,1,2,9,0,"Inside the debate over teens using AI companions for support 04:11 No question is too small when Kayla Chege, a high school student in Kansas, is using artificial intelligence . The 15-year-old asks ChatGPT for guidance on back-to-school shopping, makeup colors, low-calorie choices at Smoothie King, plus ideas for her Sweet 16 and her younger sister's birthday party. The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. ""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking."" For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you."" More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are ""everywhere in teens' lives."" Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships. ""Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,"" Steyer said. ""They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings."" As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified."" All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. ""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people."" How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. ""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it."" Artificial Intelligence"

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that across the country, 22 people were killed in Russian strikes on 73 cities, towns and villages.

Mr. Trump said Monday he is giving Russian President Vladimir Putin 10 to 12 days to stop the killing in Ukraine after three years of war , moving up a 50-day deadline he had given the Russian leader two weeks ago. The move meant Mr. Trump wants to see progress in peace efforts by Aug. 7-9. Moscow had rejected the 50-day deadline . Zelenskyy welcomed Mr. Trump's move on the timeline. ""Everyone needs peace — Ukraine, Europe, the United States, and responsible leaders across the globe,"" Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. ""Everyone except Russia.""

""Russia isn't Israel or even Iran,"" former president Dmitry Medvedev, who is deputy head of the country's Security Council, wrote on X. ""Each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of its neighbor, the Kremlin has warned Kyiv's Western backers that their involvement could end up broadening the war to NATO countries. ""Kremlin officials continue to frame Russia as in direct geopolitical confrontation with the West in order to generate domestic support for the war in Ukraine and future Russian aggression against NATO,"" the Institute for the Study of War, a Washington think tank, said late Monday. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched two Iskander-M ballistic missiles along with 37 Shahed-type strike drones and decoys at Ukraine overnight. They say 32 Shahed drones were intercepted or neutralized by Ukrainian air defenses. The Russian attack close to midnight Monday hit the Bilenkivska Correctional Facility with four guided aerial bombs, according to the State Criminal Executive Service of Ukraine. Glide bombs, which are Soviet-era bombs retrofitted with retractable fins and guidance systems, have been laying waste to cities in eastern Ukraine, where the Russian army is trying to pierce Ukrainian defenses. The bombs carry up to 6,600 pounds of explosives. At least 42 inmates were hospitalized with serious injuries, while another 40 people, including one staff member, sustained various injuries. The strike destroyed the prison's dining hall, damaged administrative and quarantine buildings, but the perimeter fence held and no escapes were reported, authorities said. Ukrainian officials condemned the attack, calling targeting civilian infrastructure, such as prisons, a war crime under international conventions. Further Russian attacks hit communities in Synelnykivskyi district with FPV drones and aerial bombs, killing at least one person and injuring two others, regional Gov. Serhii Lysak said. Russian forces also targeted the community of Velykomykhailivska, killing a 75-year-old woman and injuring a 68-year-old man, according to Lysak. Ukraine has sought to fight back against Russian strikes by developing its own long-range drone technology, hitting oil depots, weapons plants and disrupting commercial flights. Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that air defenses downed 74 Ukrainian drones over several regions overnight, including 43 over the Bryansk region. Yuri Slyusar, the head of the Rostov region, said a man in the city of Salsk was killed in a drone attack, which started a fire at the Salsk railway station.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it.

Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management — the government's human resources arm — said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in ""communal religious expressions"" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states. ""During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,"" it states. ""However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request."" The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer. According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech — for example, they can ""require that employees perform official work while on duty,"" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be ""harassing in nature."" Still, staff ""must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,"" the office said. The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can ""discuss their religious views with one another"" and ""may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views"" — but they ""must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop."" For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers ""who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome."" ""Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,"" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement . ""This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths."" Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should ""adopt a generous approach"" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons. In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive ""anti-Christian weaponization of government."" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias. The moves have drawn pushback . The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo ""outrageous and unconstitutional,"" arguing the guidance ""purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing."" ""These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,"" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement."

It's one of the Caribbean country's biggest seizures in history, said Carlos Devers, spokesperson for the country's Anti-Drug Agency. Authorities began pursuing a speedboat heading towards the island with several people on board after determining it to be suspicious, local news outlet Acento reported . Helicopters, boats and cars were involved in the chase, which began Monday off the country's south coast near Pedernales. It ended with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian, Devers said. Image released by the National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) shows the speedboat. National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) Inside the 35-foot boat were 53 bales of plastic packages, totaling 1,536 individually wrapped bags of suspected cocaine, authorities said. Authorities also seized items including a cellphone, 13 jerrycans of fuel, a small cooler filled with water and food, and a backpack with a change of clothes. The Dominican Republic has long been considered a major drug transit point, with some of the shipments bound for Europe. The largest seizure in the country's history happened last year in December when authorities seized nearly 9.5 tons of cocaine worth $250 million. Overall, officials seized more than 46 tons of drugs last year. The second biggest seizure was reported in 2006, with 2.8 tons of cocaine found at Caucedo port.

Police identified him as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said surveillance video shows the suspect leaving a double-parked black BMW alone and entering the building on Park Avenue with an M4 rifle in his right hand. He immediately opened fire at NYPD officer Didarul Islam, killing him. The gunman then shot a woman who'd taken shelter behind a pillar, then moved through the lobby, peppering it with gunfire, officials said. He then shot a security guard who'd taken cover behind a security desk. Another man who was wounded told police at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital he was shot in the lobby, Tisch said. The police commissioner said at one point the gunman was waiting for an elevator to arrive and when it did, a woman came out but he let her walk by unharmed. The gunman then took the elevator to the 33rd floor offices of Rudin Management and ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" Tisch said, killing one person before walking down the hallway and shooting himself in the chest. NYPD officers stand in line during the dignified transfer of Didarul Islam, who was shot and killed by a gunman Monday evening, out of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Hospital to the medical examiner's office, early on July 29, 2025, in New York. Angelina Katsanis / AP One man who works in the building told he ""heard all these loud bangs, had no idea what it was ... I turn around all these people are running. ... I came out five minutes later (and) one of my co-workers came out and he said he saw two people get shot, and five minutes after that another one of our co-workers came out and said he saw two police officers trying to go up to the elevator banks that go to the higher floors."" A woman who also works in the area told the station, ""We rushed the window in the direction where the helicopters are going, and then, we look and there's cop cars everywhere, and then someone pulls up Twitter and we find out that there is an active shooter."" The building houses the headquarters of the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment firms, and has numerous other well-known tenants. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the gunman appeared to have been targeting the NFL offices. ""He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,"" Adams said on ""CBS Mornings"" Tuesday. A perimeter was blocked off around the building for blocks in every direction. NYPD officers and caution tape warned passersby away. Helicopters passed overhead for hours. People were told to shelter in place in buildings in the vicitniity. A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting. Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday. A young man who moved to New York only two weeks ago to work for Bank of America came to check out the scene. At an building nearby, people were ordering in late takeout food and gathering in the lobby. They told of colleagues who'd stepped out to get food as it was happening, not realizing what was going on down the block. Even hours after the shooting, one young woman seemed unsure if it was safe to leave.

Local TV footage showed lines of people evacuating the office building where the shootings took place with their hands above their heads in the hours after the killings, according to The Associated Press. Nekeisha Lewis was eating dinner with friends on the nearby plaza when she heard gunfire. ""It felt like it was a quick two shots and then it was rapid fire,"" she told the AP. Windows shattered and a man ran from the building saying, ""Help, help. I'm shot."" Lewis said. Kyle Marshall, 38, was working at a nearby Morgan Stanley office when his mother texted him about an active-shooter incident, asking if he was OK, Reuters reports. ""Then she texted me the address, and I was, like, 'Oh my God. That's right next door to my building,'"" he said. Marshall lives in the San Francisco area but comes to New York monthly for work.

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote. Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to ""ensure accuracy and fairness,"" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create ""security risks and undermines the integrity of the process.""

Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.""

Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25 to discuss Epstein. After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment ""on the substance"" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that ""there were a lot of questions and we went all day.""

The gunman, who used a high-powered rifle to open fire in the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three civilians. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition. Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on ""CBS Mornings,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place. The tower at 345 Park Ave. contains offices for several other major corporations, including the accounting firm KPMG and the investment company Blackstone . President Trump said in a social media post that he had been briefed on the shooting, which he called ""tragic"" and ""a senseless act of violence."" Here's what we know so far about the incident and the investigation. What happened? Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle. The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program. Surveillance footage shows the gunman exiting his black BMW on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building . The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner. The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting to take to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices for the building's owner Rudin Management are located. The commissioner said he ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" and struck one of the victims who eventually died. At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said. The victims Didarul had two young sons and his wife is currently pregnant, Adams said at a news conference Monday night, praising him for his service on the police force and his character. ""He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city,"" Adams said. ""And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about."" In a statement, the NYPD said Didarul ""represented the very best of our department."" The three civilians killed in the shooting include the second security guard in the lobby and employees at Rudin Management and Blackstone. The security guard was identified as Aland Etienne. He was an unarmed security guard working for McLane Security Inc., according to 32BJ SEIU, a union representing property service workers. He had been in his role at the building on Park Avenue since 2019. In a statement, Blackstone identified one of the victims killed as their employee Wesley LePatner . ""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed,"" the statement said. ""She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email Monday night that someone working for the league ""was seriously injured"" in the shooting. Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable. The suspect Police have shared preliminary details about Tamura, but a number of questions remained Tuesday. It appeared he had attempted to target the NFL offices located inside the Park Avenue tower but used the wrong elevator, and ended up on a different floor, Adams said. He told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday that the shooter had a note on his person that referenced CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. ""He did have a note on him,"" Adams said. ""The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury."" Tamura never played in the NFL, but local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appear to show he played high school football. He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas. Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work Sunday when he failed to show up. Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon. That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found. Parts of the gun used in the shooting were purchased by an associate of the gunman in Las Vegas, the NYPD spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear how he got the other parts to assemble the rifle or why the associate had to purchase some for him. A team of NYPD detectives has located the associate in Las Vegas and is interviewing him. The NYPD also plans to execute a search warrant on the gunman's home, the spokesperson said. The shooter did purchase the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the spokesperson said. ""A violent, despicable attack"" Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting. Adams on Monday described it as ""a violent, despicable attack,"" adding, ""No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""a horrific act of violence"" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States. ""The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,"" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms ""only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder."" ""The time to act is now,"" Hochul continued. ""The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen."" Shooting New York City"

A fourth Tour de France title was all but won anyway, so finishing safely in the pack would do fine for Tadej Pogačar. Especially considering Sunday's final stage had already been neutralized for safety reasons and he just had to complete the race. Surely there was no need to launch a seemingly pointless attack and risk crashing? But holding back or being cautious rarely appeals to Pogačar, the 26-year-old cycling star from Slovenia. He clinched his fourth Tour title in inimitably daring style on Sunday and further cemented his place among cycling's greats. Even though he really did not need to, and risked falling on oil slick-wet roads, Pogačar simply could not help himself. Against all logical opinion, he tried winning Sunday's 21st and final stage with trademark uphill attacks, only to fall short of the stage win itself. Tour de France winner Tadej Pogacar of Slovenia crosses the finish line of the twenty-first stage of the Tour de France. Thibault Camus / AP ""In the end I found myself in the front, even though I didn't have the energy,"" said Pogačar, who won the Tour last year and in 2020 and 2021. ""Just speechless to win the Tour de France, this one feels especially amazing,"" Pogačar added. ""Just super proud that I can wear this yellow jersey."" Two-time Tour champion Jonas Vingegaard finished the overall race 4 minutes, 24 seconds behind Pogačar in second place and Florian Lipowitz was 11 minutes adrift in third. Belgian rider Wout van Aert won the 21st and last stage, which broke with tradition and featured three climbs of Montmartre hill. Because of heavy rain and the risk of crashes, organizers had earlier neutralized the times 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the end, effectively giving Pogačar the victory — providing he crossed the finish line. He did the opposite of what almost every rider would do with victory a near certainty. As the rain teemed down, he set a tremendous pace in the Montmartre climbs as fans cheered all along the cobbled Rue Lepic, with flags and fans hanging out of windows. Only five riders were left with Pogačar on the third ascension of the 1.1-kilometer Montmartre hill. After fending off American Matteo Jorgenson, he was caught cold near the top as Van Aert launched a stunning attack to drop — yes, drop! — Pogačar, the world's best climber, on the steepest section. ""Hats off to Wout, he was incredibly strong,"" Pogačar said. Van Aert rolled back down for a prestigious stage win on the famed Champs-Élysées. Pogačar looked weary as he crossed the line in fourth place, 19 seconds behind. But then it was time to celebrate title No. 4. Although, don't expect Pogačar to make any headlines on that front. ""Everyone celebrates in their own way, I just want peace and some nice weather, not like here today,"" Pogačar said. ""Just to enjoy some quiet days at home."" Only four riders have won the showcase race five times: Belgian Eddy Merckx, Spaniard Miguel Induráin and Frenchmen Jacques Anquetil and Bernard Hinault. Pogačar won four stages this year to take his Tour tally to 21 and 30 at major races, including six at the Giro d'Italia and three at the Spanish Vuelta. Italy's Jonathan Milan, the best sprinter, Slovenia's Tadej Pogacar, the Tour de France winner, and Germany's Florian Lipowitz, the best young rider, from left, celebrate during the presentation ceremony for the Tour de France on the Champs-Elysees in Paris, France, Sunday, July 27, 2025. Bernard Papon / AP The UAE Team Emirates leader praised his teammates. ""I think the second week was the decisive moment,"" Pogačar said. ""We took more advantage."" Lipowitz, meanwhile, secured his first career podium at a Grand Tour, the alternative name given to the three major races. His performance, following his third-placed finish last month at the Critérium du Dauphiné, suggests the 24-year-old German rider could challenge in the near future. Traditionally, the last stage is largely processional with riders doing laps around Paris. The Tour broke with tradition after the success of the Paris Olympics road race, which also took in Montmartre, famous for its Sacré-Coeur basilica. It was the fifth straight year where Pogačar and Vingegaard finished 1-2 at the Tour. Vingegaard was second in 2021, before beating Pogačar the next two years with the Slovenian second. When Pogačar reclaimed his title last year, Vingegaard was runner-up. ""We've raised the level of each other much higher and we push each other to the limit,"" Pogačar said. ""I must say to him, big, big respect."" Pogačar has also won the Giro d'Italia, doing so last year to become the first cyclist to secure the Giro and Tour double in the same season since the late Marco Pantani in 1998. But Pogačar has not yet won the Spanish Vuelta, whereas Anquetil, Hinault and Merckx won all three major races. When Pogačar won the hilly fourth stage of this year's race, it was the 100th professional victory of his stellar career, all events combined. Pogačar is also the world road race champion. His dominant victory at the Critérium continued his excellent form in the spring classics. After winning stage 4 of the Tour, Pogačar added three more stage wins, including an emphatic uphill time trial. He would love to win the Paris-Roubaix classic and Milan San-Remo. The 259.2-kilometer, or 161-mile, Roubaix race is called ""The Hell of the North"" because of its dangerous cobblestone sections. Pogačar's debut appearance at the one-day classic this year saw him seeking to become the first Tour champion to win it since Hinault in 1981. But powerful Dutch rider Mathieu van der Poel won it for the third straight year. Pogačar has also yet to win Milan-San Remo, with Van der Poel also beating him there this year. Expect a fired-up Pogačar next year at Roubaix and Milan-San Remo. But it's unclear whether he'll tackle the Vuelta. Paris Sports Slovenia France"

This was the first singles victory for Williams in nearly two years. The only older woman to win a match was Martina Navratilova at 47 in 2004. The former No. 1-ranked Williams had not played singles in an official match since March 2024 in Miami, missing time while having surgery to remove uterine fibroids. She hadn't won in singles since August 2023 in Cincinnati. Until this week, she was listed by the WTA Tour as ""inactive."" Venus Williams celebrates her win over Peyton Stearns during a match at the Citi Open tennis tournament Tuesday, July 22, 2025, in Washington. Nick Wass / AP ""It is not easy,"" Williams said, ""to (come back) after all that time and play the perfect match."" But backed by a crowd that clearly was there to see, and support, her at the hard-court tournament in the nation's capital, Williams showed glimpses of the talent she possesses and the skills she displayed while earning all of her Grand Slam titles: seven in singles, 14 in women's doubles — all alongside younger sister Serena — and two in mixed doubles. ""I wanted to play a good match,"" she told the fans, then added a phrase that drew appreciative roars: ""and win the match."" In Tuesday's second game, for example, Williams smacked a return winner to get things started, then delivered a couple of other big responses to break Stearns, a 23-year-old who won singles and team NCAA titles at the University of Texas and is currently ranked 35th. In the next game, Williams sprinted forward to reach a drop shot and replied with a winner. Soon, she led 4-2, then closed that set. She was accompanied by choruses of cheers. The first arrived when Williams walked out into the main stadium at the DC Open, a 7,000-seat arena that's more than twice as large as where she was for her doubles victory a day earlier. Another came when she strode from the sideline to the center of the court for the formality of the coin toss. The noise really reached a crescendo when Williams began hitting aces — at 110 mph and faster — the way she used to. There also were moments where Williams — who said her fiancé was in the stands — looked as if it had been just as long as it actually has since she competed, including in the opening game, when she got broken at love this way: forehand wide, forehand into the net, forehand long, backhand long. At the end, it took Williams a bit of extra effort to close things out. She kept holding match points and kept failing to convert them. But eventually, she powered in a 112 mph serve that Stearns returned into the net. That was it: Williams smiled wide as can be and jogged to the net to shake hands, then performed her customary post-win pirouette-and-wave. She advanced to a second-round matchup against No. 5 seed Magdalena Frech, a 27-year-old from Poland. In other action Tuesday, Emma Raducanu handed No. 7 seed Marta Kostyuk a sixth consecutive loss by eliminating her 7-6 (4), 6-4. That set up a matchup between Raducanu and four-time major champion Naomi Osaka, who was a 6-2, 7-5 winner against Yulia Putintseva. Two top men's seeds exited: Cam Norrie beat No. 2 Lorenzo Musetti 3-6, 6-2, 6-3, and No. 3 Holger Rune withdrew from the tournament because of a back injury. No. 4 seed Ben Shelton defeated Mackie McDonald 6-3, 6-4. Sports Washington Venus Williams Tennis"

The deadline for applications to the program is midnight Friday. With those deferred resignations, NASA's civil servant workforce would shrink from about 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. This figure also includes about 500 employees who were lost through normal attrition, the agency said. ""Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,"" NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner said in a statement. According to NASA, about 870 employees applied to leave during the first round of the Deferred Resignation Program, and about 3,000 employees during the second round. The deferred resignation program was a buyout program introduced across the federal government by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the onset of the Trump administration in an effort to slash costs and reduce the size of the federal workforce. A White House budget proposal issued in May would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18 billion. NASA has also been roiled by a leadership crisis in recent months. In December, President Trump nominated billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman, a friend of former DOGE head Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator. Musk's SpaceX has several NASA contracts . However, in late May, Mr. Trump pulled Isaacman's nomination just ahead of the Senate confirmation vote, which was followed days later by a public fallout between Mr. Trump and Musk. Earlier this month, the president announced that Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy would temporarily lead the agency. Trump Administration NASA"

It's one of the Caribbean country's biggest seizures in history, said Carlos Devers, spokesperson for the country's Anti-Drug Agency. Authorities began pursuing a speedboat heading towards the island with several people on board after determining it to be suspicious, local news outlet Acento reported . Helicopters, boats and cars were involved in the chase, which began Monday off the country's south coast near Pedernales. It ended with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian, Devers said. Image released by the National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) shows the speedboat. National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) Inside the 35-foot boat were 53 bales of plastic packages, totaling 1,536 individually wrapped bags of suspected cocaine, authorities said. Authorities also seized items including a cellphone, 13 jerrycans of fuel, a small cooler filled with water and food, and a backpack with a change of clothes. The Dominican Republic has long been considered a major drug transit point, with some of the shipments bound for Europe. The largest seizure in the country's history happened last year in December when authorities seized nearly 9.5 tons of cocaine worth $250 million. Overall, officials seized more than 46 tons of drugs last year. The second biggest seizure was reported in 2006, with 2.8 tons of cocaine found at Caucedo port.

Border Patrol and the Florida Highway Patrol were conducting immigration enforcement on May 2 when they detained Kenny Laynez, a high school senior who was on his way to work as a landscaper with two other co-workers and his mother, who was driving. Video Laynez recorded of the arrest shows an officer telling him, a U.S. citizen who was born and raised in the country, ""You got no rights here. You're an amigo, brother."" The car was pulled over for having too many people sitting in the front seat. Two passengers were undocumented, according to Laynez, and officers are seen on the video using a Taser. The teens' two co-workers were both detained, and Laynez says he has been unable to contact them. ""We're not resisting. We're not committing any crime to, you know, run away,"" Laynez said, recalling the arrest. Laynez's phone continued recording after he was detained, capturing an exchange in which an officer tells another, ""They're starting to resist more. We're gonna end up shooting some of them."" Another officer replies, ""Just remember, you can smell that too with a $30,000 bonus."" Florida Highway Patrol did not comment. The video comes as Florida is set to deputize more than 1,800 additional law enforcement officers to conduct immigration operations as part of a statewide crackdown. ""Laws are just, you know, they're no longer being respected. They're no longer being upheld,"" said Mariana Blanco, director at the Guatemala Maya Center, an advocacy group that opposes Florida's new crackdown. ""Deputizing these agents so quickly, it is going to bring severe consequences."""

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day? Best sources of iron other than red meat Connelly's suggestions for plant-based iron sources include: Lentils Beans Tofu Pumpkin seeds Spinach Certain seafoods are also great choices, she added, including: Oysters Clams Sardines Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of The Nutrition Changer , said another important source of iron in the United States if fortified breads and cereals. According to the National Institutes of Health , about half of dietary iron comes from bread, cereal and other grain products in the U.S. Iron found in plant-based sources like nuts and beans, however, need to be transformed before our bodies can absorb it, Jiang explained, adding it's best to pair plant-based iron with vitamin C-rich foods to boost absorption. Still worried you're not getting enough iron? Supplements are another option to consider after consulting your doctor, experts said. ""Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources,"" Jiang said.

Neither of the AI models scored full marks — unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old. Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month. ""We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,"" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. ""Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow.""

The result ""achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI"" at ""the world's most prestigious math competition,"" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post. ""We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,"" he said. ""For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof."" Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems. That took two to three days of computation — far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said. The IMO said tech companies had ""privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,"" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries. ""It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,"" said IMO president Dolinar. Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities — a landmark known as ""artificial general intelligence."" Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicted that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment.

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause.

Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

Police identified him as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said surveillance video shows the suspect leaving a double-parked black BMW alone and entering the building on Park Avenue with an M4 rifle in his right hand. He immediately opened fire at NYPD officer Didarul Islam, killing him. The gunman then shot a woman who'd taken shelter behind a pillar, then moved through the lobby, peppering it with gunfire, officials said. He then shot a security guard who'd taken cover behind a security desk. Another man who was wounded told police at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital he was shot in the lobby, Tisch said. The police commissioner said at one point the gunman was waiting for an elevator to arrive and when it did, a woman came out but he let her walk by unharmed.

He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,"" Adams said on ""CBS Mornings"" Tuesday. A perimeter was blocked off around the building for blocks in every direction. NYPD officers and caution tape warned passersby away. Helicopters passed overhead for hours. People were told to shelter in place in buildings in the vicitniity. A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting. Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday. A young man who moved to New York only two weeks ago to work for Bank of America came to check out the scene. At an building nearby, people were ordering in late takeout food and gathering in the lobby. They told of colleagues who'd stepped out to get food as it was happening, not realizing what was going on down the block. Even hours after the shooting, one young woman seemed unsure if it was safe to leave.

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-transcontinental-railroad/,Politics,2025-07-29 11:40:12-04:00,Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern propose merger to create nation's first transcontinental railroad,13,1095,2025-07-29 17:15:29.889480,103,21,0,2,9,0,"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger worth $85 billion could create 1st transcontinental railroad 00:25 Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country. The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia. The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage. The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week. Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic. Pressure on remaining railroads If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times. There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered. Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal. Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly. ""It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,"" Vena told investors Tuesday. From 30 to 6 U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide. Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year. Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC , but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago. Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry. That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East. ""We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,"" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved. Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad. There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads. On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs. Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.

A dermatologist explains the skin care trend and its benefits.,15,517,2025-07-29 17:15:30.012687,112,19,3,0,11,0,"What to know about the red light therapy trend 03:50 Red light therapy , also known as LED therapy, is gaining popularity in the skin care world for its potential anti-aging benefits. Dr. Rachel Nazarian, a board-certified dermatologist in New York, told ""CBS Mornings Plus"" that LED, or light emitting diodes, create a narrow wavelength that can ""penetrate the deepest into the tissue, which is probably why it has all this potential to help skin."" This form of light therapy is popping up on social media, with users demonstrating hand-held devices as well as full facial masks they're incorporating into their self-care routines. Here's what else to know about the treatment option. Potential benefits of red light therapy ""There is no doubt that red light can be very, very beneficial to skin,"" Nazarian said. She said there are ""a lot of studies on red light"" but that additional, more standardized studies are still needed. ""What it's actually doing is stimulating the cells to create new energy. And what does our body do with energy? It cleans. So it gives you more collagen, decreases the depth of your wrinkles, can decrease the size of your pores,"" she said. But she says red light therapy won't replace everything in a dermatologist's anti-aging skin care arsenal. ""This is not going to mean you don't do your Botox Cosmetic, your fillers, your lasers — that's separate, those are done in the doctor's office, but these red lights are really fantastic because you have the power to do them at home and safely for most people,"" she said. Red light devices and risks to look for Nazarian admits it can be hard to know the exact efficacy of these devices, since they're not very standardized and may vary in their strength, number of light bulbs and proximity to skin. ""It helps to look for something that says 'FDA cleared,' and that sits in the low energy red light spectrum,"" she said, suggesting that many users may want to avoid devices with infrared. ""Infrared is something you'll see combined with red light a lot these days. Infrared can give off heat. Heat is not good for all skin types. So that's something people might want to steer away from."" The risk with infrared includes skin redness, burning and swelling, which can happen with higher energy types, Nazarian said. And while these therapies don't use UV light, which can damage your skin and eyes, it's best to reduce eye exposure to the bright lights. ""Bright lights are not great for eyes,"" she said. ""So look for the masks that have the little cutouts around your eyes or the ones that come with eyewear."" Generally, however, she considers these therapies safe. ""Unless you have a very specific and rare eye condition, these lights are generally safe at low energy levels for everyone of all skin types,"" Nazarian said."

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote. Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to ""ensure accuracy and fairness,"" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create ""security risks and undermines the integrity of the process."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25 to discuss Epstein. After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment ""on the substance"" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that ""there were a lot of questions and we went all day."" Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is ""allowed"" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.

The deadline for applications to the program is midnight Friday. With those deferred resignations, NASA's civil servant workforce would shrink from about 18,000 to 14,000 personnel. This figure also includes about 500 employees who were lost through normal attrition, the agency said. ""Safety remains a top priority for our agency as we balance the need to become a more streamlined and more efficient organization and work to ensure we remain fully capable of pursuing a Golden Era of exploration and innovation, including to the Moon and Mars,"" NASA spokesperson Cheryl Warner said in a statement. According to NASA, about 870 employees applied to leave during the first round of the Deferred Resignation Program, and about 3,000 employees during the second round. The deferred resignation program was a buyout program introduced across the federal government by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency at the onset of the Trump administration in an effort to slash costs and reduce the size of the federal workforce. A White House budget proposal issued in May would see NASA's funding cut by about 25% for fiscal year 2026, from about $24 billion to $18 billion. NASA has also been roiled by a leadership crisis in recent months. In December, President Trump nominated billionaire private astronaut Jared Isaacman, a friend of former DOGE head Elon Musk, to serve as NASA's next administrator. Musk's SpaceX has several NASA contracts . However, in late May, Mr. Trump pulled Isaacman's nomination just ahead of the Senate confirmation vote, which was followed days later by a public fallout between Mr. Trump and Musk.

In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."

Asked about a tariff rate ""for the world,"" as Mr. Trump put it, the president responded, ""I would say it'll be somewhere in the 15 to 20% range."" The U.S. president made the remarks seated alongside U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland , as Mr. Trump visits his golf courses there and meets with European leaders. The U.S. and U.K. have already reached a trade agreement, and over the weekend, after meeting with European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the two leaders announced a trade deal between the U.S. and the EU. A Trump administration deadline of Aug. 1 for other countries to reach trade deals with the U.S. is rapidly approaching. Without an individual deal, Mr. Trump says most countries' products will see a flat tariff rate. ""I just want to be nice. I would say in the range of 15 to 20%,"" Mr. Trump said Monday, adding, ""probably one of those two numbers."" But as recently as Wednesday, Mr. Trump floated a higher range, between 15% and 50%. Mr. Trump, who in April said the U.S. had 200 trade deals with other nations, has since said there are too many countries for individual trade deals with all of them and the U.S. will have ""simple"" tariffs for ""most"" countries. ""We have over 200 countries, people don't realize, that's a lot of, that's a lot of deals ... that would be too much for anybody,"" the president said Wednesday.

Authorities began pursuing a speedboat heading towards the island with several people on board after determining it to be suspicious, local news outlet Acento reported . Helicopters, boats and cars were involved in the chase, which began Monday off the country's south coast near Pedernales. It ended with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian, Devers said. Image released by the National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) shows the speedboat.

Authorities also seized items including a cellphone, 13 jerrycans of fuel, a small cooler filled with water and food, and a backpack with a change of clothes. The Dominican Republic has long been considered a major drug transit point, with some of the shipments bound for Europe. The largest seizure in the country's history happened last year in December when authorities seized nearly 9.5 tons of cocaine worth $250 million. Overall, officials seized more than 46 tons of drugs last year. The second biggest seizure was reported in 2006, with 2.8 tons of cocaine found at Caucedo port.

Neither of the AI models scored full marks — unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old. Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month. ""We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,"" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. ""Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow."" Around 10% of human contestants won gold-level medals, and five received perfect scores of 42 points. U.S. ChatGPT maker OpenAI said its experimental reasoning model had also scored a gold-level 35 points on the test. The result ""achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI"" at ""the world's most prestigious math competition,"" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post. ""We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,"" he said. ""For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof."" Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems. That took two to three days of computation — far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said. The IMO said tech companies had ""privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,"" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries. ""It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,"" said IMO president Dolinar.

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote.

Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.""

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day? Best sources of iron other than red meat Connelly's suggestions for plant-based iron sources include: Lentils Beans Tofu Pumpkin seeds Spinach Certain seafoods are also great choices, she added, including: Oysters Clams Sardines Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of The Nutrition Changer , said another important source of iron in the United States if fortified breads and cereals.

Still worried you're not getting enough iron? Supplements are another option to consider after consulting your doctor, experts said.

Here's what to know.,18,794,2025-07-29 17:15:30.921379,116,22,7,3,11,0,"Why a court struck down most of Trump's tariffs 05:49 The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval. A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday announced a pact , easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China. What both sides are arguing The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal basis for imposing his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of tariffs in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl . ""This case is about more than high tariffs,"" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress."" IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs. ""It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' — and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years"" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case. The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. ""The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. Why the case is important Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an ""unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States."" But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said. ""If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals — just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,"" Schwab said in an email. Presidents can draw on other statutes , such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs. How we got here The U.S. Court of International Trade in May struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs , with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded ""any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs."" At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May blocked the trade court ruling and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed. After the trade court ruling in May, Desai said Mr. Trump would use ""all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans."" The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch. That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court . Tariffs"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-transcontinental-railroad/,Entertainment,2025-07-29 11:40:12-04:00,Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern propose merger to create nation's first transcontinental railroad,13,1095,2025-07-29 17:15:31.012739,103,21,0,2,9,0,"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger worth $85 billion could create 1st transcontinental railroad 00:25 Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country. The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia. The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage. The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week. Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic. Pressure on remaining railroads If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times. There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered. Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal. Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly. ""It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,"" Vena told investors Tuesday. From 30 to 6 U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide. Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year. Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC , but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago. Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry. That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East. ""We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,"" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved. Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad. There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads. On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs. Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/,World,2025-07-29 12:51:09-04:00,"Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling — CBS News analysis",15,944,2025-07-29 17:15:31.326718,118,23,8,3,10,2,"03:57 Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly declined — and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause.

Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/micro-cheating-relationship-advice/,Health,2025-03-12 08:54:00-04:00,What is micro-cheating? Relationship experts share what to know and how to prevent it.,14,944,2025-07-29 17:15:31.791697,113,21,1,2,11,0,"Are you microcheating on your spouse? 03:47 With cheating in a relationship , whether physical or emotional, it's typically clear when things have gone too far — but what about your partner seemingly turning up the charm for a friend or co-worker? Are they flirting or just being friendly? According to relationship experts, those subtle acts may be ""micro-cheating."" Micro-cheating can involve following or ""liking"" photos of attractive people on social media or interactions on a day-to-day basis with people in real life. ""For example, revealing too much personal information to someone that you see regularly or intense flirting with someone at work, but never quite acting on it,"" Burrets said. Why do people micro-cheat? A few things can spur micro-cheating, and it can be intentional or unintentional. ""If a person has a pattern of pushing the boundaries in relationships and getting away with it, they might engage in these behaviors regularly and intentionally,"" Burrets said, where as ""someone who might feel dissatisfied or unfulfilled in a relationship might be trying to meet those needs or get satisfied elsewhere without fully consciously realizing it."" ""While it might be something about your relationship that is unfulfilling, it also could be something about yourself, your own life, your own self-esteem and your own satisfaction overall, that is compelling you to kind of get that attention fed elsewhere,"" she added. There may also be an evolutionary reason people micro-cheat, explained Wendy Walsh, a relationship expert at the website DatingAdvice and psychology professor with a doctorate in clinical psychology. ""According to evolutionary psychologists who have studied human mating cross-culturally around the world, all humans, no matter what relationship they're in, always keep in the back of their minds a backup mate, an idea that if something happened in their relationship, who they could call,"" she said. How micro-cheating impacts relationships Micro-cheating can negatively impact a couple in a number of ways. First, getting needs met outside of your primary relationship can lead to neglect of that relationship, Burrets said. ""We get a dopamine hit when we get attention and affection from others, and that dopamine hit is stronger when there's novelty involved. So when it's a new person, it can feel initially more compelling,"" she said. ""If we continue to put our energy in sources outside of our relationship, we only have so much bandwidth. And the danger is that we would neglect the nurturing and care of our own primary relationship."" The effects on a partner can vary. ""There's a broad spectrum for how partners react to this kind of behavior,"" Burrets said. ""For some people, flirting is a totally harmless behavior."" For others, it can feel like a threat, Walsh said. ""It can be very dangerous, because when you have one partner feeling threatened and is not feeling that they have a safe relationship or a secure attachment, then they're going to react in all kinds of ways,"" she said. ""If it continues for a long period of time, it can erode trust, and it can erode the feeling of safety in your primary relationship."" How to prevent micro-cheating To make sure you and your partner are on the same page about what is and isn't appropriate, experts advise having a conversation about boundaries and expectations early on. Burrets suggested having that conversation at the same time you talk about exclusivity. ""If exclusivity is part of your relationship, a lot of times we go in expecting that we both have the same concept of what exclusivity means, and we often don't,"" she said. Questions can include, ""How do we define exclusivity? What does that mean to us in this relationship?"" What if I suspect my partner is micro-cheating? If you haven't already had conversations about boundaries, now is the time to set expectations, Burrets said. ""Ideally you want to bring this up with a proactive tone, rather than a critical tone,"" she said. If your partner is violating pre-established boundaries, this is a time for greater intention and intensity, Burrets added. ""You don't want to come at this discussion from an emotionally dysregulated place, because it's likely to escalate and go absolutely nowhere,"" she said. ""Try to come at it from a place of curiosity as much as possible, even though you'll also be managing feelings of betrayal and hurt."" Walsh agreed, adding if you're accusatory, the other person is just going to be defensive. Instead, focus on your own feelings with ""I"" statements, experts suggest. For example: ""I noticed when you liked those women's pictures on Instagram that I had a feeling inside myself of worry that you are potentially going to leave me or that I wasn't as attractive, and that feeling showed me how much I value you and our relationship,"" Walsh said. She urged people to bring up their feelings if they want behavior to change. ""Remember, silence is always perceived as permission,"" Walsh said. Can micro-cheating lead to other forms of cheating? While micro-cheating doesn't have to lead to formal cheating, Burrets and Walsh said it can be a slippery slope. ""Especially for people who are feeling unsatisfied in their relationship, and then an actual need appears to be getting met by the micro-cheating. It kind of reinforces the behavior and maybe makes it more likely that the person will keep pushing the boundary,"" Burrets said."

Both physiological and environmental factors play a role in men developing postpartum depression. While men don't have as dramatic of hormonal changes as women do during pregnancy, LaPook said there are studies showing testosterone level can go down during and after a partner's pregnancy.

""We all remember those times in the middle of the night when you feel out of control."" And while studies show men have the highest levels of postpartum depression during the first 3 to 6 months after birth, LaPook says it's important to remember it can happen anytime.

Here's what to know.,18,794,2025-07-29 17:15:32.274005,116,22,7,3,11,0,"Why a court struck down most of Trump's tariffs 05:49 The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval. A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday announced a pact , easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China. What both sides are arguing The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal basis for imposing his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of tariffs in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl . ""This case is about more than high tariffs,"" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress."" IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs. ""It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' — and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years"" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case. The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. ""The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. Why the case is important Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an ""unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States."" But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said. ""If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals — just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,"" Schwab said in an email. Presidents can draw on other statutes , such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs. How we got here The U.S. Court of International Trade in May struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs , with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded ""any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs."" At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May blocked the trade court ruling and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed. After the trade court ruling in May, Desai said Mr. Trump would use ""all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans."" The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch. That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court . Tariffs"

Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia. ""I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'"" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. ""And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything."" It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin ""wants peace.""

It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be ""harassing in nature."" Still, staff ""must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,"" the office said. The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can ""discuss their religious views with one another"" and ""may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views"" — but they ""must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop."" For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers ""who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome."" ""Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,"" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement . ""This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths."" Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should ""adopt a generous approach"" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons. In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive ""anti-Christian weaponization of government."" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias. The moves have drawn pushback . The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo ""outrageous and unconstitutional,"" arguing the guidance ""purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing."" ""These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,"" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement."

It's one of the Caribbean country's biggest seizures in history, said Carlos Devers, spokesperson for the country's Anti-Drug Agency. Authorities began pursuing a speedboat heading towards the island with several people on board after determining it to be suspicious, local news outlet Acento reported . Helicopters, boats and cars were involved in the chase, which began Monday off the country's south coast near Pedernales. It ended with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian, Devers said. Image released by the National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) shows the speedboat. National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) Inside the 35-foot boat were 53 bales of plastic packages, totaling 1,536 individually wrapped bags of suspected cocaine, authorities said. Authorities also seized items including a cellphone, 13 jerrycans of fuel, a small cooler filled with water and food, and a backpack with a change of clothes. The Dominican Republic has long been considered a major drug transit point, with some of the shipments bound for Europe. The largest seizure in the country's history happened last year in December when authorities seized nearly 9.5 tons of cocaine worth $250 million. Overall, officials seized more than 46 tons of drugs last year. The second biggest seizure was reported in 2006, with 2.8 tons of cocaine found at Caucedo port. National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) said Tuesday that it confiscated over a ton of cocaine following a more than 12 hours long boat chase.

The third NASCAR Cup victory of Wallace's career was also his biggest. It snapped a 100-race winless streak that dated to 2022 at Kansas. He also won at Talladega in 2021. It's his first win at one of NASCAR's four crown jewel races. ""Unbelievable,"" Wallace shouted on his radio after crossing the yard of bricks. After he came to a stop, Wallace got out to greet his wife, Amanda Carter, and their 10-month-old son. He gave his wife a kiss and then lifted young Beckett up in the air and towards the crowd. Wallace told ""CBS Mornings"" in April that his mindset had shifted in a powerful way since becoming a father. ""Nothing else matters anymore, besides being a great father, being a great husband, being a great family man,"" Wallace said. ""Prior to that, it was always racing first, and I've missed out on a lot of good memories and opportunities by putting that first and causing a lot of stress from within or the people surrounding me ... It took having a kid to realize there's so much more to life."" Bubba Wallace, driver of the #23 Chumba Casino Toyota, celebrates after winning the NASCAR Cup Series Brickyard 400 Presented by PPG at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 27, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. The final gap between Wallace and Larson was 0.222 seconds on Sunday. Larson trailed by 5.057 seconds with 14 laps to go, but the gap was down to about three seconds with six remaining when the yellow flag came out because of rain. The cars rolled to a stop on pit lane with four to go, giving Wallace about 20 additional minutes to think and rethink his restart strategy. But after beating Larson through the second turn, a crash behind the leaders forced a second overtime, extending the race even more laps as Wallace's team thought he might run out of gas. Wallace risked everything by staying on the track, then beat the defending race winner off the restart again to prevent Larson from becoming the fourth back-to-back winner of the Brickyard. Bubba Wallace, driver of the #23 Chumba Casino Toyota, takes the checkered flag to win the NASCAR Cup Series Brickyard 400 Presented by PPG at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on July 27, 2025 in Indianapolis, Indiana. It also alleviated the frustration Wallace felt Saturday when he spent most of the qualifying session on the provisional pole only to see Chase Briscoe surpass him with one of the last runs in the session. He made sure there was no repeat Sunday, giving an added boost to the 23XI Racing co-owned by basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan and last week's race winner, Denny Hamlin, as it continues to battle NASCAR in court over its charter status. ""Knowing how big this race is, knowing all the noise that's going on in the background, to set that all aside is a testament to these people here on the 23 team,"" Wallace said in a post-race interview.

Here's what we know about the investigation.,18,1465,2025-07-29 17:15:33.003023,121,26,9,5,11,1,"What's known about the investigation, suspect in NYC office building shooting 03:21 Four people were killed in a shooting Monday evening inside a New York City office building. The gunman, who used a high-powered rifle to open fire in the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three civilians. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition. Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on ""CBS Mornings,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place. The tower at 345 Park Ave. contains offices for several other major corporations, including the accounting firm KPMG and the investment company Blackstone . President Trump said in a social media post that he had been briefed on the shooting, which he called ""tragic"" and ""a senseless act of violence."" Here's what we know so far about the incident and the investigation. What happened? Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle. The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program. Surveillance footage shows the gunman exiting his black BMW on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building . The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner. The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting to take to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices for the building's owner Rudin Management are located. The commissioner said he ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" and struck one of the victims who eventually died. At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said. The victims Didarul had two young sons and his wife is currently pregnant, Adams said at a news conference Monday night, praising him for his service on the police force and his character. ""He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city,"" Adams said. ""And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about."" In a statement, the NYPD said Didarul ""represented the very best of our department."" The three civilians killed in the shooting include the second security guard in the lobby and employees at Rudin Management and Blackstone. The security guard was identified as Aland Etienne. He was an unarmed security guard working for McLane Security Inc., according to 32BJ SEIU, a union representing property service workers. He had been in his role at the building on Park Avenue since 2019. In a statement, Blackstone identified one of the victims killed as their employee Wesley LePatner . ""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed,"" the statement said. ""She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email Monday night that someone working for the league ""was seriously injured"" in the shooting. Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable. The suspect Police have shared preliminary details about Tamura, but a number of questions remained Tuesday. It appeared he had attempted to target the NFL offices located inside the Park Avenue tower but used the wrong elevator, and ended up on a different floor, Adams said. He told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday that the shooter had a note on his person that referenced CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. ""He did have a note on him,"" Adams said. ""The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury."" Tamura never played in the NFL, but local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appear to show he played high school football. He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas. Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work Sunday when he failed to show up. Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon. That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found. Parts of the gun used in the shooting were purchased by an associate of the gunman in Las Vegas, the NYPD spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear how he got the other parts to assemble the rifle or why the associate had to purchase some for him. A team of NYPD detectives has located the associate in Las Vegas and is interviewing him. The NYPD also plans to execute a search warrant on the gunman's home, the spokesperson said. The shooter did purchase the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the spokesperson said. ""A violent, despicable attack"" Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting. Adams on Monday described it as ""a violent, despicable attack,"" adding, ""No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""a horrific act of violence"" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States. ""The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,"" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms ""only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder."" ""The time to act is now,"" Hochul continued. ""The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen."" Shooting New York City"

He immediately opened fire at NYPD officer Didarul Islam, killing him. The gunman then shot a woman who'd taken shelter behind a pillar, then moved through the lobby, peppering it with gunfire, officials said. He then shot a security guard who'd taken cover behind a security desk. Another man who was wounded told police at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital he was shot in the lobby, Tisch said.

I came out five minutes later (and) one of my co-workers came out and he said he saw two people get shot, and five minutes after that another one of our co-workers came out and said he saw two police officers trying to go up to the elevator banks that go to the higher floors."" A woman who also works in the area told the station, ""We rushed the window in the direction where the helicopters are going, and then, we look and there's cop cars everywhere, and then someone pulls up Twitter and we find out that there is an active shooter."" The building houses the headquarters of the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment firms, and has numerous other well-known tenants.

NYPD officers and caution tape warned passersby away. Helicopters passed overhead for hours. People were told to shelter in place in buildings in the vicitniity. A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting. Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday. A young man who moved to New York only two weeks ago to work for Bank of America came to check out the scene. At an building nearby, people were ordering in late takeout food and gathering in the lobby. They told of colleagues who'd stepped out to get food as it was happening, not realizing what was going on down the block. Even hours after the shooting, one young woman seemed unsure if it was safe to leave.

Local TV footage showed lines of people evacuating the office building where the shootings took place with their hands above their heads in the hours after the killings, according to The Associated Press. Nekeisha Lewis was eating dinner with friends on the nearby plaza when she heard gunfire. ""It felt like it was a quick two shots and then it was rapid fire,"" she told the AP.

The color is approved for use in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced non-carbonated water, fruit drinks, ready-to-drink teas as well as hard and soft candy. Petitioned by the Gardenia Blue Interest Group, the additive is made by refining the compound genipin — derived from crushed Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit, which is often used in traditional Chinese medicine — by reacting it with soy protein hydrolysate. Though soy, a potential allergen, is used to make gardenia blue, the group has asked the FDA to exempt it from having to declare it as such. In its request, it says the soy protein is not expected to be detected in the final color additive and therefore will not cause allergic reactions. The FDA says it is still reviewing the request . ""Every day, children are exposed to synthetic chemicals in food that serve no purpose and threaten their health,"" Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a news release . ""The FDA's approval of gardenia blue shows we're finally putting kids first. Thanks to Dr. Marty Makary's bold leadership, we're cutting through industry influence and taking decisive action to Make America Healthy Again."" The FDA says this marks the fourth color derived from natural sources approved by the administration for use in foods in the last two months. In May, three other colors were approved , including galdieria extract blue, calcium phosphate (white) and butterfly pea flower extract (blues, purples and greens). Kennedy previously called on companies to phase out all petroleum-based dyes by the end of next year, with the goal to replace them with natural alternatives in the U.S. food supply. The food dye industry has denied any safety concerns with artificial dyes. The International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after Kennedy's initial announcement that artificial dyes are ""essential for consistency, visual appeal, and consumer trust in food products.""

Economists and other experts say consumers can expect to see higher prices for imported items targeted by the latest round of tariffs in the coming weeks and months. Groceries Perhaps the most impacted day-to-day purchases for American families will be at the grocery store, where a large share of our most commonly purchased fruits and vegetables are imported from Mexico, Canada, China and other countries facing tariffs. Experts suggest the cost of those tariffs will be passed on to consumers in the grocery checkout lane. We examined the prices for fruits, vegetables and juices that are primarily imported from other countries, according to USDA data. The average prices are drawn from weekly surveys that the Agriculture Department conducts at hundreds of stores across the country. We've tracked the weekly price data from 2020 through last week. Cars and trucks The cost of owning and operating a car or truck in the United States is a major focus ahead of the threatened White House tariffs on vehicles manufactured in other countries — a change experts predict will add thousands more to the cost of ownership, parts, repairs and insurance. In the wake of the COVID pandemic, supply-chain interruptions and the inflation that followed, the price of buying new and used cars rose sharply. So did the cost of parts, repairs and insurance. The charts show the price as an index — the percentage above a baseline. For new and used vehicles, we're using an example of a small SUV to translate the percentages into dollars to explain the recent years' change. Used car prices spiked after the COVID pandemic because major supply chain disruptions and a global computer chip shortage severely slowed down new vehicle production. In some cases, late-model used vehicle prices soared to nearly the same as new models of the same or similar vehicles. Some of the same phenomenon drove up the price of auto parts, and consequently, consumers' bills at repair shops. In addition to the rising cost of repairs, labor shortages, driving habits and increasing crash trends have driven up the cost of automobile insurance premiums, aggravating the total cost of owning and operating personal cars and trucks.

The discovery was made on a small plot in Gdańsk, a city on the country's coast. The site was once home to an ice cream parlor called Miś, which operated there since 1962 but has since moved to a new location. Researchers say several other archaeological discoveries have been made at the site in recent years, including the remains of cottages dating back to the 12th and 13th century and an ancient city street. Archaeologists from the ArcheoScan Archaeological and Conservation Workshop were working on the site in July when they found the knight's tombstone. The stone, made of limestone, was engraved with the image of a knight, the organization said on social media . On July 8, the headstone was moved to Gdańsk's Archaeological Museum. Early analysis determined the stone likely dates back to the 13th or 14th century. Archaeology efforts uncover the tombstone of a medieval knight in Gdansk, Poland. ArcheoScan Two days later, the team found the complete skeleton of the medieval knight. He was buried about five inches under the tombstone, researchers said on social media . He appears to have been about 40 years old when he died, anthropologist Dr. Aleksandra Pudło said in an article published on Gdańsk's official website . The knight appears to have been between about 5'6"" and 5'10"" tall, researchers said. Pudło said the skull and bones of the skeleton were very well-preserved. Gdańsk's website noted that the skull is in worse shape than the other bones. It's not clear who the knight may have served, according to Gdańsk's official website. The city was captured by a German Catholic military order called the Teutonic Knights in the early 13th century. It's also unclear if the burial predates or postdates the event, researchers said. The knight may have also served the Sobiesław dynasty, which ruled Gdańsk during the 11th and 12th century. Archaeology efforts uncover the skeleton of a medieval knight in Gdansk, Poland. ArcheoScan More research will be conducted on the skeleton and the tombstone, as well as other relics found during the dig. Researchers have found several other notable tombstones, though the knight's appears to be the most impressive. The tombstone will be examined with 3D software, and archaeologists will likely attempt a detailed reconstruction of the artifact. Pudło said that the skeleton of the knight will undergo a ""thorough examination,"" and the results of that may be available as early as next year. Archaeologist Poland"

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials. The photos were the first from inside the main structural support called the pedestal in the hardest-hit No. 1 reactor's primary containment vessel, an area directly under the reactor's core.

The sophomore honors student makes a point not to have chatbots do her homework and tries to limit her interactions to mundane questions. But in interviews with The Associated Press and a new study, teenagers say they are increasingly interacting with AI as if it were a companion, capable of providing advice and friendship. ""Everyone uses AI for everything now. It's really taking over,"" said Chege, who wonders how AI tools will affect her generation. ""I think kids use AI to get out of thinking."" For the past couple of years, concerns about cheating at school have dominated the conversation around kids and AI. But artificial intelligence is playing a much larger role in many of their lives. AI, teens say, has become a go-to source for personal advice, emotional support, everyday decision-making and problem-solving. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you."" More than 70% of teens have used AI companions and half use them regularly, with 34% reporting daily usage or multiple times a week, according to a new study from Common Sense Media, a group that studies and advocates for using screens and digital media sensibly. The study defines AI companions as platforms designed to serve as ""digital friends,"" like Character. AI or Replika, which can be customized with specific traits or personalities and can offer emotional support, companionship and conversations that can feel human-like. But popular sites like ChatGPT and Claude, which mainly answer questions, are being used in the same way, the researchers say. In an interview with ""CBS Evening News"" on Wednesday, Common Sense founder and CEO Jim Steyer said what struck him about the study is that AI companions are ""everywhere in teens' lives."" Common Sense's study also found that 11% of teens use AI companions to build up their courage and stand up for themselves, which Steyer said can be a good thing. However, he cautioned that problems arise when the technology replaces human relationships. ""Younger kids really trust these AI companions to be like friends or parents or therapists,"" Steyer said. ""They're talking about serious relationships, and these are robots. They're not human beings."" As the technology rapidly gets more sophisticated, teenagers and experts worry about AI's potential to redefine human relationships and exacerbate crises of loneliness and youth mental health. ""AI is always available. It never gets bored with you. It's never judgmental,"" says Ganesh Nair, an 18-year-old in Arkansas. ""When you're talking to AI, you are always right. You're always interesting. You are always emotionally justified."" All that used to be appealing, but as Nair heads to college this fall, he wants to step back from using AI. Nair got spooked after a high school friend who relied on an ""AI companion"" for heart-to-heart conversations with his girlfriend later had the chatbot write the breakup text ending his two-year relationship. ""That felt a little bit dystopian, that a computer generated the end to a real relationship,"" said Nair. ""It's almost like we are allowing computers to replace our relationships with people."" How many teens are using AI? New study stuns researchers In the Common Sense Media survey, 31% of teens said their conversations with AI companions were ""as satisfying or more satisfying"" than talking with real friends. Even though half of teens said they distrust AI's advice, 33% had discussed serious or important issues with AI instead of real people. Those findings are worrisome, says Michael Robb, the study's lead author and head researcher at Common Sense, and should send a warning to parents, teachers and policymakers. The now-booming and largely unregulated AI industry is becoming as integrated with adolescence as smartphones and social media are. ""It's eye-opening,"" said Robb. ""When we set out to do this survey, we had no understanding of how many kids are actually using AI companions."" The study polled more than 1,000 teens nationwide in April and May. Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added.

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day?

Still worried you're not getting enough iron? Supplements are another option to consider after consulting your doctor, experts said. ""Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources,"" Jiang said.

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds. About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found. The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings. ""Deeply unequal"" ""Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,"" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch. She added, ""Nearly half of private sector workers — 56 million people — lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap — it's a crisis."" About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023 analysis . The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs. While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month. ""To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,"" Pew noted in its analysis. ""Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks."" Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans . Creaking Social Security system While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted. ""What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,"" she said. Ghilarducci added, ""Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving."" The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary — or even only — source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034 , one year sooner than previously forecast. At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income. Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security. ""The Pew report is a wake-up call,"" Ghilarducci said. ""If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it — workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages."" Social Security"

Neither of the AI models scored full marks — unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old. Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month. ""We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,"" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. ""Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow."" Around 10% of human contestants won gold-level medals, and five received perfect scores of 42 points. U.S. ChatGPT maker OpenAI said its experimental reasoning model had also scored a gold-level 35 points on the test. The result ""achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI"" at ""the world's most prestigious math competition,"" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post. ""We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,"" he said. ""For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof."" Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems. That took two to three days of computation — far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said. The IMO said tech companies had ""privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,"" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries. ""It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,"" said IMO president Dolinar. Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities — a landmark known as ""artificial general intelligence."" Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicted that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment. ""It's moving incredibly fast,"" Hassabis said. ""I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.""

Adolescence is a critical time for developing identity, social skills and independence, Robb said, and AI companions should complement — not replace — real-world interactions. ""If teens are developing social skills on AI platforms where they are constantly being validated, not being challenged, not learning to read social cues or understand somebody else's perspective, they are not going to be adequately prepared in the real world,"" he said. When asked whether the issue at play is with the AI technology itself or the way kids live in the modern world today, Steyer said he believes it's both. The nonprofit analyzed several popular AI companions in a "" risk assessment ,"" finding ineffective age restrictions and that the platforms can produce sexual material, give dangerous advice and offer harmful content. While Common Sense's CEO said he supports the growth and innovation of AI, the group doesn't recommend that minors use AI companions. ""In terms of its impact on young people, and on families in general, [the study] is an extraordinary finding and one that I think makes us very concerned about kids under the age of 18 being exposed to these kinds of companions,"" Steyer said. A concerning trend to teens and adults alike Researchers and educators worry about the cognitive costs for youth who rely heavily on AI, especially in their creativity, critical thinking and social skills. The potential dangers of children forming relationships with chatbots gained national attention last year when a 14-year-old Florida boy died by suicide after developing an emotional attachment to a Character. AI chatbot. ""Parents really have no idea this is happening,"" said Eva Telzer, a psychology and neuroscience professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. ""All of us are struck by how quickly this blew up."" Telzer is leading multiple studies on youth and AI, a new research area with limited data. Telzer's research has found that children as young as 8 are using generative AI and also found that teens are using AI to explore their sexuality and for companionship. In focus groups, Telzer found that one of the top apps teens frequent is SpicyChat AI, a free role-playing app intended for adults. Many teens also say they use chatbots to write emails or messages to strike the right tone in sensitive situations. ""One of the concerns that comes up is that they no longer have trust in themselves to make a decision,"" said Telzer. ""They need feedback from AI before feeling like they can check off the box that an idea is OK or not."" Arkansas teen Bruce Perry, 17, says he relates to that and relies on AI tools to craft outlines and proofread essays for his English class. ""If you tell me to plan out an essay, I would think of going to ChatGPT before getting out a pencil,"" Perry said. He uses AI daily and has asked chatbots for advice in social situations, to help him decide what to wear and to write emails to teachers, saying AI articulates his thoughts faster. Perry says he feels fortunate that AI companions were not around when he was younger. ""I'm worried that kids could get lost in this,"" Perry said. ""I could see a kid that grows up with AI not seeing a reason to go to the park or try to make a friend."" Other teens agree, saying the issues with AI and its effect on children's mental health are different from those of social media. ""Social media complemented the need people have to be seen, to be known, to meet new people,"" Nair said. ""I think AI complements another need that runs a lot deeper — our need for attachment and our need to feel emotions. It feeds off of that."" ""It's the new addiction,"" Nair added. ""That's how I see it."" Artificial Intelligence"

Here's what we know about the investigation.,18,1465,2025-07-29 17:15:34.471708,121,26,9,5,11,1,"What's known about the investigation, suspect in NYC office building shooting 03:21 Four people were killed in a shooting Monday evening inside a New York City office building. The gunman, who used a high-powered rifle to open fire in the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three civilians. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition. Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on ""CBS Mornings,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place. The tower at 345 Park Ave. contains offices for several other major corporations, including the accounting firm KPMG and the investment company Blackstone . President Trump said in a social media post that he had been briefed on the shooting, which he called ""tragic"" and ""a senseless act of violence."" Here's what we know so far about the incident and the investigation. What happened? Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle. The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program. Surveillance footage shows the gunman exiting his black BMW on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building . The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner. The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting to take to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices for the building's owner Rudin Management are located. The commissioner said he ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" and struck one of the victims who eventually died. At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said. The victims Didarul had two young sons and his wife is currently pregnant, Adams said at a news conference Monday night, praising him for his service on the police force and his character. ""He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city,"" Adams said. ""And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about."" In a statement, the NYPD said Didarul ""represented the very best of our department."" The three civilians killed in the shooting include the second security guard in the lobby and employees at Rudin Management and Blackstone. The security guard was identified as Aland Etienne. He was an unarmed security guard working for McLane Security Inc., according to 32BJ SEIU, a union representing property service workers. He had been in his role at the building on Park Avenue since 2019. In a statement, Blackstone identified one of the victims killed as their employee Wesley LePatner . ""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed,"" the statement said. ""She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email Monday night that someone working for the league ""was seriously injured"" in the shooting. Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable. The suspect Police have shared preliminary details about Tamura, but a number of questions remained Tuesday. It appeared he had attempted to target the NFL offices located inside the Park Avenue tower but used the wrong elevator, and ended up on a different floor, Adams said. He told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday that the shooter had a note on his person that referenced CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. ""He did have a note on him,"" Adams said. ""The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury."" Tamura never played in the NFL, but local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appear to show he played high school football. He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas. Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work Sunday when he failed to show up. Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon. That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found. Parts of the gun used in the shooting were purchased by an associate of the gunman in Las Vegas, the NYPD spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear how he got the other parts to assemble the rifle or why the associate had to purchase some for him. A team of NYPD detectives has located the associate in Las Vegas and is interviewing him. The NYPD also plans to execute a search warrant on the gunman's home, the spokesperson said. The shooter did purchase the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the spokesperson said. ""A violent, despicable attack"" Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting. Adams on Monday described it as ""a violent, despicable attack,"" adding, ""No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""a horrific act of violence"" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States. ""The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,"" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms ""only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder."" ""The time to act is now,"" Hochul continued. ""The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen."" Shooting New York City"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-transcontinental-railroad/,World,2025-07-29 11:40:12-04:00,Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern propose merger to create nation's first transcontinental railroad,13,1095,2025-07-29 17:15:34.563167,103,21,0,2,9,0,"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger worth $85 billion could create 1st transcontinental railroad 00:25 Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country. The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia. The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage. The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week. Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic. Pressure on remaining railroads If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times. There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered. Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal. Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly. ""It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,"" Vena told investors Tuesday. From 30 to 6 U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide. Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year. Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC , but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago. Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry. That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East. ""We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,"" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved. Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad. There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads. On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs. Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/novo-nordisk-shares-down-copycat-drugs-july-2025/,U.S.,2025-07-29 13:40:24-04:00,Novo Nordisk shares fall 20% after company names new CEO and lowers its financial outlook,15,551,2025-07-29 17:15:34.639891,112,27,4,8,11,0,"Patients fear losing access to affordable weight loss drugs amid FDA crackdown 02:55 Novo Nordisk shares plunged over 20% on Tuesday after the company named a new CEO and lowered its profit expectations, citing weaker sales of its popular weight-loss drug Wegovy due to competition from copycat drugs. In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."

The findings were hailed as a breakthrough, which raises hopes that women with mutations in their mitochondrial DNA could one day have children without passing debilitating or deadly diseases on to the children. One out of every 5,000 births is affected by mitochondrial diseases, which cannot be treated, and include symptoms such as impaired vision, diabetes and muscle wasting. In 2015, Britain became the first country to approve an in-vitro fertilization technique that uses a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA from the egg of a donor — along with the mother's egg and father's sperm. Some have called the result of this process ""three-parent babies,"" though researchers have pushed back at this term because only roughly 0.1% of the newborn's DNA comes from the donor. The results of the much-awaited U.K. trial were published in several papers in the New England Journal of Medicine. This image from video provided by the Newcastle Fertility Centre shows a nuclear genome from an egg carrying a mitochondrial DNA mutation being inserted into an egg donated by an unaffected woman. Newcastle Fertility Centre, Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust via AP 8 children with DNA from 3 people currently healthy Out of 22 women to undergo the treatment at the Newcastle Fertility Centre in northeast England, eight babies were born. The four boys and four girls now range from under 6 months to over 2 years old. The amount of mutated mitochondrial DNA — which causes disease — was reduced by 95-100% in six of the babies, according to the research. For the other two newborns, the amount fell by 77-88%, which is still below the range that causes disease. This indicates the technique was ""effective in reducing transmission"" of diseases between mother and child, one of the studies said. The eight children are currently healthy, though one had a disturbance of their heart's rhythm which was successfully treated, the researchers said. Their health will be followed up over the coming years to see if problems arise. Oxford University reproductive genetics expert Dagan Wells noted that among the eight children, three have shown some signs of what is known as ""reversal,"" which is still little understood. It is ""a phenomenon where the therapy initially succeeds in producing an embryo with very few defective mitochondria, but by the time the child is born the proportion of abnormal mitochondria in its cells has significantly increased,"" he explained. Nevertheless, Nils-Goran Larsson, a Swedish reproductive expert not involved in the research, hailed it as a ""breakthrough."" The new technique offers a ""very important reproductive option"" for families affected by ""devastating"" mitochondrial diseases, he added. While the U.K. trial is the first to involve multiple mothers, the eight babies born to them are not the first to be born with DNA from three people. That first came in 2016 , after a woman was treated by U.S. fertility specialists in Mexico, where there were no laws regulating the practice. A similar IVF method was used in that groundbreaking case. Ethical concerns over embryos and ""designer babies"" Mitochondrial donation remains controversial and has not been approved in many countries, including the United States and France. Religious leaders have opposed the procedure because it involves the destruction of human embryos. Other opponents have expressed fears it could pave the way for genetically engineered ""designer babies."" An ethical review carried out by the U.K.'s independent Nuffield Council on Bioethics was ""instrumental"" in conducting the new research, the council's director Danielle Hamm said Wednesday. Peter Thompson, head of the U.K.'s Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which approved the procedure, said only people with a ""very high risk"" of passing on a mitochondrial disease would be eligible for the treatment. Ethical concerns have also been raised over the use of mitochondrial donation for infertility in Greece and Ukraine. ""In the context of infertility, it has not been proven,"" she added.

Tea's investigation of the incident found that app users' direct messages had been breached, along with some of their photos. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we have taken the affected system offline,"" Tea said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. The app, which has become one of Apple's most downloaded free apps , was compromised in a cyberattack that exposed members' personal information, including selfies, Tea said Friday. The hackers accessed a data storage system containing information that members had uploaded prior to February 2024, the company said. An additional 59,000 images and direct messages were also accessed without authorization, according to Tea. Tea lets women share information about their dates and run background checks on potential matches, among other things. Ted Miracco, CEO at mobile security maker Approov, urged users to exhibit caution in sharing personal information on widely downloaded apps.. ""A lot of people presume that if an app is available through Apple or Google, that it's safe. That's the first mistake consumers make,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Miracco also said Tea lacked adequate security protections. ""This is basic cybersecurity and something the company should be held accountable for,"" he said.

The shooting took place on the most populous island, Providenciales. The injuries ranged from minor to serious, Police Commissioner Fitz Bailey said. Nine of the individuals injured had gunshot wounds, acting Gov. Anya Williams said. The hospital in Providenciales was on lockdown to protect those being treated for their injuries, Williams said. At least two of those injured were flown overseas for further treatment, she said. At least four suspects were involved in the shooting, but no one has been arrested, according to Bailey, who called it ""deeply disturbing."" ""We are now having a gangland-type slaying, and a lot of this gang violence seems to be concentrated in our Haitian communities,"" Premier Charles Washington Misick said at a press conference. He called on the Haitian community to cooperate with police, saying some of them know how guns are being smuggled into the Turks and Caicos Islands. ""What is happening here is unlike anything we've ever seen before,"" he said. ""This is not a situation we should accept."" A $10,000 reward is being offered for any information that leads to the capture of the suspects, Bailey said. A motive had not yet been determined. The shooting comes as the archipelago cracks down on illegal immigration. An estimated 10,900 Haitians live in the Turks and Caicos Islands, representing a third of the territory's population. Around 80% of Haitians live in Providenciales, and 20% have permanent residency, according to the United Nations humanitarian affairs office. The U.S. State Department's travel advisory for Turks and Caicos Islands is a Level 2, Exercise Increased Caution. The primary reason for that is crime, the department says. ""Most crime occurs in Providenciales. Police may have limited investigatory resources,"" the advisory says . The department's advice for Americans who choose to travel to the islands includes ""avoid walking alone and at night"" and ""do not physically resist any robbery attempt."" Shooting Crime"

In the first half of 2025, companies announced 744,308 job cuts nationwide, the highest tally since the first six months of 2020, when employers cut nearly 1.6 million jobs in response to COVID-related disruptions, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Federal agencies have been particularly hard hit this year amid a push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash costs. Other sectors shedding a large number of workers include retail, technology, media and non-profit organizations. Microsoft on Wednesday announced it would cut just under 4% of its workforce, or roughly 9,000 employees , in what is a second major round of layoffs this year for the profitable tech giant. While the economy remains solid by most measures, economists warn that growth could cool in the coming months as the effects of the Trump administration's tariff policies take hold. DOGE effect Challenger, Gray & Christmas point to several reasons layoffs are on the rise. The leading factor is DOGE, which the firm said has accounted for nearly 287,000 cuts so far this year. Firings by the task force led to a spike in federal worker cuts earlier this year at the Department of Health and Human Services , Department of Education , USAID and other agencies. Thousands also departed through a deferred resignation program. States in the East and Southeast have seen the biggest jump in layoffs, with a more than 220% jump from a year ago, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. ""This dramatic rise is largely due to significant reductions at federal agencies headquartered in Washington, D.C.,"" the firm said in its report. DOGE's activities also affected employees in other states and industries that benefit from government funding, including nonprofit groups. So far this year, nonprofit organizations have announced roughly 17,000 job cuts, up 407% from the same period last year, the new data shows. Tariff hit An economic slowdown and rocky financial markets has led companies to shed more than 154,000 jobs this year, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Retailers have eliminated nearly 80,000 jobs this year, up 255% from the first half of 2024. ""Retailers are one of the hardest hit business sectors by tariffs, inflation and uncertainty,"" Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement. ""If consumer spending continues to fall, it could mean more job losses in this industry."" Challenger Gray directly attributes 2,000 layoffs so far this year to stepped-up U.S. tariffs on foreign imports. Other factors the contributing to the wave of layoffs include store closings and company restructuring efforts.

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,Politics,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:35.269365,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"

In a memo to the heads of federal agencies, the Office of Personnel Management — the government's human resources arm — said public employees have the right to religious expression in the workplace, citing civil rights law and the First Amendment. That includes the right to discuss religion, engage in ""communal religious expressions"" and display items such as bibles, crucifixes and mezuzahs on their desks, the memo states. ""During a break, an employee may engage another in polite discussion of why his faith is correct and why the non-adherent should re-think his religious beliefs,"" it states. ""However, if the non-adherent requests such attempts to stop, the employee should honor the request."" The five-page memo listed out other examples of religious expression that federal workers shouldn't be punished for. OPM said in its memo that employees can invite co-workers who belong to other religions to their church or put up invitations to Easter services on communal bulletin boards; staff can display religious posters, Veterans Affairs doctors can pray over their patients, and park rangers for the National Park Service can join their tour groups in prayer. According to the memo, agencies can still broadly limit staffers' speech — for example, they can ""require that employees perform official work while on duty,"" and they can ban employees from putting up posters of any kind, both religious and non-religious. It also said attempts to persuade co-workers about religion can't be ""harassing in nature."" Still, staff ""must be allowed to engage in private religious expression in work areas to the same extent that they may engage in nonreligious private expression,"" the office said. The policy isn't entirely new. In 1997, the Clinton administration said federal employees can ""discuss their religious views with one another"" and ""may even attempt to persuade fellow employees of the correctness of their religious views"" — but they ""must refrain from such expression when a fellow employee asks that it stop."" For years, the Department of Labor's online religious discrimination guidelines have said staffers ""who seek to proselytize in the workplace should cease doing so with respect to any individual who indicates that the communications are unwelcome."" ""Federal employees should never have to choose between their faith and their career,"" OPM Director Scott Kupor said Monday in a statement . ""This guidance ensures the federal workplace is not just compliant with the law but welcoming to Americans of all faiths."" Monday's memo comes amid a broader push by the Trump administration to let federal workers express religious beliefs. Earlier this month, OPM said federal agencies should ""adopt a generous approach"" when staffers ask for permission to work from home or change their schedules for religious reasons, citing a 2023 Supreme Court case in which a mail carrier requested Sundays off for religious reasons. In early February, shortly after returning to office, President Trump signed an executive order accusing the Biden administration of pervasive ""anti-Christian weaponization of government."" The order set up a task force to look into alleged anti-Christian bias. Months later, the State Department encouraged staff to report any allegations of bias. The moves have drawn pushback . The Freedom From Religion Foundation called Monday's memo ""outrageous and unconstitutional,"" arguing the guidance ""purports to protect religious expression in the federal workplace but encourages outright proselytizing."" ""These shocking changes essentially permit workplace evangelizing, but worse still, allow supervisors to evangelize underlings and federal workers to proselytize the public they serve,"" the group's co-president, Annie Laurie Gaylor, said in a statement."

But in the Navajo Nation, a solution to curbing the now national epidemic is emerging. The sexually transmitted infection can lead to serious health problems if left untreated. Syphilis cases skyrocketed in the U.S. as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's STD prevention budget dropped, data shows. In 2003, the budget was around $169 million and there were about 34,000 cases in the U.S. In 2023, the budget was roughly $80 million and there were about 209,000 cases nationwide. On Tuesday, the Trump administration began layoffs across multiple federal health agencies including the CDC. While it's unclear exactly how the cuts will impact STD programs, the CDC's National Center for HIV, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and Tuberculosis Prevention is affected, in addition to programs for reproductive health, maternal and child health, and HIV. Syphilis cases skyrocketed in the U.S. as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's STD prevention budget dropped, data shows.

Most of these cases could be prevented with early testing and treatment during pregnancy.

Here's what to know.,18,794,2025-07-29 17:15:35.645387,116,22,7,3,11,0,"Why a court struck down most of Trump's tariffs 05:49 The Trump administration's trade policy faces a critical test this week as a federal court weighs the legality of its sweeping tariffs. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Thursday in V.O.S. Selections v. Trump, a case brought by five small business owners and 12 states who allege they have been harmed by President Trump's import taxes. V.O.S., the lead plaintiff in the case, is a New-York based wine importer. The lawsuit challenges President Trump's claim that he has authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) to issue tariffs, a process that normally requires congressional approval. A victory by the plaintiffs could deal a blow to Mr. Trump as he seeks to negotiate trade deals with U.S. economic partners. The U.S. and the European Union on Sunday announced a pact , easing tension over a brewing trade war. But the White House has yet to reach deals with other major trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, South Korea and China. What both sides are arguing The plaintiffs in the V.O.S. case argue that Mr. Trump exceeded his authority when he bypassed congressional approval and invoked IEEPA as the legal basis for imposing his ""Liberation Day"" tariffs on April 2. Mr. Trump also drew on IEEPA in deploying a separate set of tariffs in February against Canada, Mexico and China that he said was aimed at stemming the flow of undocumented immigrants and fentanyl . ""This case is about more than high tariffs,"" Brent Skorup, a legal fellow at the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C., nonpartisan think tank, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. ""It's about whether a president can stretch a vague statute beyond recognition to sidestep Congress."" IEEPA, among other things, gives the president authority to regulate transactions with foreign countries during national emergencies. However, no U.S. president has ever invoked IEEPA as a justification for imposing tariffs. ""It's limited to emergencies where there is an 'unusual and extraordinary threat' — and the trade deficit is hardly an emergency. It's been with us for basically 50 years"" said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center, a nonpartisan public interest law representing the five businesses that have filed suit in the case. The White House has defended President Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs. ""The administration is legally and fairly using tariff powers that have been granted to the executive branch by the Constitution and Congress to level the playing field for American workers and safeguard our national security,"" White House spokesperson Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch in a statement. Why the case is important Mr. Trump has said tariffs are necessary to eliminate trade imbalances with other countries, which he said constitutes an ""unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States."" But a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs could have broader implications for trade policy, forcing Mr. Trump to seek congressional approval in imposing tariffs, Schwab said. ""If the court holds that the President's Liberation Day and fentanyl tariffs are unlawful, then he would not have authority to set those tariff rates, but still Congress could approve these deals — just like it did the NAFTA renegotiation in the first Trump term,"" Schwab said in an email. Presidents can draw on other statutes , such as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to authorize the use of tariffs. How we got here The U.S. Court of International Trade in May struck down Mr. Trump's tariffs , with a three-judge panel ruling that the levies exceeded ""any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs."" At the time, the trade court said the 10% reciprocal tariffs are designed to deal with trade imbalances, which the judges said did not constitute an emergency under IEEPA. But a federal appeals court in May blocked the trade court ruling and reinstated the tariffs after the Trump administration appealed. After the trade court ruling in May, Desai said Mr. Trump would use ""all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans."" The case now heads to the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., where lawyers from both parties will present their arguments. The court could issue a decision as early as August, Schwab told CBS MoneyWatch. That decision likely won't be the end of the road for the case, with Schwab expecting the losing party to appeal to the Supreme Court . Tariffs"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/,U.S.,2025-07-29 12:51:09-04:00,"Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling — CBS News analysis",15,944,2025-07-29 17:15:35.784152,118,23,8,3,10,2,"03:57 Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly declined — and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

The identical TRACERS satellites will operate in the magnetosphere, ""the region around our Earth that is dominated by the planet's magnetic field, and it protects us from the stellar radiation and really from everything else that's going on in space,"" said Joseph Westlake, director of NASA's solar physics division. ""What we will learn from TRACERS is critical for the understanding and eventually the predicting of how energy from our sun impacts the Earth and our space and ground-based assets, whether it be GPS or communication signals, power grids, space assets and our astronauts working up in space. ""It's going to help us keep our way of life safe here on Earth."" A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California carrying seven satellites, including NASA's twin TRACERS probes, SpaceX Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new ""polylingual"" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols. Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the ""radiation budget,"" and another that will focus on how high-energy ""killer electrons"" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere. Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental ""cubesat"" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world. The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg. The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad. A camera mounted on the Falcon 9's second stage shows the reusable first stage falling away and heading back to landing at Vandenberg, SpaceX's 27th booster recovery in California and its 479th overall. SpaceX A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch. Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later. TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind ""couples"" with Earth's magnetic field. ""So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,"" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa. ""And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system."" An artist's impression of the TRACERS satellites, flying one after the other in the same orbit. With two identical satellites, scientists expect to measure rapid changes in the near-Earth space environment as the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field. NASA That coupling drives spectacular auroral displays , ""but it also drives some of the negative things that we want to... understand and mitigate, like unplanned electrical currents in our electrical grids that can potentially cause accelerated aging in electrical pipelines, disruption of GPS, things like that."" ""So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,"" Miles said. The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols. The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs. The first of two TRACERS satellites is released to fly on its own. (SpaceX) SpaceX Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space. Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites. The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator. ""The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,"" she said. ""These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction."" The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, ""it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them."" What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which ""could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.""

Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

The gunman, who used a high-powered rifle to open fire in the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three civilians. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition. Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on ""CBS Mornings,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place. The tower at 345 Park Ave. contains offices for several other major corporations, including the accounting firm KPMG and the investment company Blackstone . President Trump said in a social media post that he had been briefed on the shooting, which he called ""tragic"" and ""a senseless act of violence."" Here's what we know so far about the incident and the investigation. What happened? Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle. The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program. Surveillance footage shows the gunman exiting his black BMW on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building . The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner. The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting to take to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices for the building's owner Rudin Management are located. The commissioner said he ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" and struck one of the victims who eventually died. At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said. The victims Didarul had two young sons and his wife is currently pregnant, Adams said at a news conference Monday night, praising him for his service on the police force and his character. ""He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city,"" Adams said. ""And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about."" In a statement, the NYPD said Didarul ""represented the very best of our department."" The three civilians killed in the shooting include the second security guard in the lobby and employees at Rudin Management and Blackstone. The security guard was identified as Aland Etienne. He was an unarmed security guard working for McLane Security Inc., according to 32BJ SEIU, a union representing property service workers. He had been in his role at the building on Park Avenue since 2019. In a statement, Blackstone identified one of the victims killed as their employee Wesley LePatner . ""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed,"" the statement said. ""She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email Monday night that someone working for the league ""was seriously injured"" in the shooting. Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable. The suspect Police have shared preliminary details about Tamura, but a number of questions remained Tuesday. It appeared he had attempted to target the NFL offices located inside the Park Avenue tower but used the wrong elevator, and ended up on a different floor, Adams said. He told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday that the shooter had a note on his person that referenced CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. ""He did have a note on him,"" Adams said. ""The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury."" Tamura never played in the NFL, but local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appear to show he played high school football. He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas. Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work Sunday when he failed to show up. Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon. That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found. Parts of the gun used in the shooting were purchased by an associate of the gunman in Las Vegas, the NYPD spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear how he got the other parts to assemble the rifle or why the associate had to purchase some for him. A team of NYPD detectives has located the associate in Las Vegas and is interviewing him. The NYPD also plans to execute a search warrant on the gunman's home, the spokesperson said. The shooter did purchase the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the spokesperson said. ""A violent, despicable attack"" Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting. Adams on Monday described it as ""a violent, despicable attack,"" adding, ""No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""a horrific act of violence"" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States. ""The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,"" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms ""only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder."" ""The time to act is now,"" Hochul continued. ""The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen."" Shooting New York City"

The Mariners breakout slugger, nicknamed Big Dumper, advanced from the first round on a tiebreaker by less than an inch over the Athletics' Brent Rooker, then won his semifinal 19-13 over Pittsburgh's Oneil Cruz, whose 513-foot first-round drive over Truist Park's right-center field seats was the longest of the night. Hitting second in the final round, the 22-year-old Caminero closed within three dingers, took three pitches and hit a liner to left field. Becoming the first switch-hitter and first catcher to win the title, Raleigh had reached the All-Star break with a major league-leading 38 home runs. He became the second Mariners player to take the title after three-time winner Ken Griffey Jr. Raleigh was pitched to by his father, Todd, former coach of Tennessee and Western Carolina. His younger brother, Todd Raleigh Jr., did the catching. Just the second Derby switch-hitter after Baltimore's Adley Rutschman in 2023, Raleigh hit his first eight left-handed, took a timeout, then hit seven right-handed.

In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

A recent study asked just that. In the study, published Monday in the journal Frontiers in Psychology , 40.2% of participants reported certain eating habits affected their sleep. The study used data from online surveys taken by 1,082 college-aged participants who submitted their experiences from January to April 2023. The survey asked about more than a dozen food groups, including dairy, desserts and sweets, fruit and meat. Around 25% of participants said at least one of the food groups worsened their sleep and about 20% said at least one made their sleep better. Desserts and sweets, spicy food, and dairy, including milk, yogurt and cheese, were mainly blamed for worse sleep, while fruit, herbal tea and vegetables were among the top foods that reportedly made participants sleep better. Asked about dreams, 5.5% of participants reported that food affected their dreams, with nightmares being attributed mostly to desserts and sweets at 31% and dairy at 22%. ""While we still lack substantive evidence that these participant observations for food and dreaming are, in fact, accurate, there is some suggestive evidence for their accuracy,"" the authors noted, pointing to previous research on the effect different foods have on sleep. The authors also concluded that the results suggest that associations between dairy consumption and disturbing dreams may be due to gastrointestinal distress caused by lactose intolerance . ""This analysis supports the notion that specific food-induced symptoms such as bloating, cramping or excess gas arising during sleep have a negative impact on dreaming,"" they wrote. The authors also noted some potential biases in the research, namely that participants were university students enrolled in psychology courses, meaning they may have had prior exposure to topics that ""influenced how they interpreted or reported the perceived effects of food on sleep and dreaming.""

Between inflation eating into paychecks and high interest rates making debt harder to manage, money stress is hitting a lot of Americans hard right now. According to a recent Pew Research Center survey , about 40% of Americans say they're in only fair financial shape currently, while about 17% say they're in poor financial shape. And, while those statistics are troubling enough, 28% also expect their financial situation to be worse a year from now, up significantly from 16% in May 2024. But while a lot of people are feeling the pressure, the weight that comes with worrying about your finances can be crushing, especially when the solutions you're considering require money or time that you can't spare. The truth is, though, that traditional financial advice often misses the mark when you're already struggling. Reducing financial stress isn't just about having more money or time, after all. It's also about taking back control. And while you can't control everything, like the state of the economy or Fed rate hikes, you can take small but meaningful steps to get things back on track. Below, we'll detail a few ways you can get started today. Find out how you can start tackling your high-rate debt today . 5 ways to reduce your financial stress right now Taking one or more of these steps could help alleviate the pressure on your finances and help you get things back on track: Build a basic spending plan Budgeting might not sound like a cure for financial stress, but getting your income and expenses down on paper or in a budgeting app can be surprisingly empowering. A clear picture of where your money is going makes it easier to spot patterns, plug leaks and prioritize what matters. You don't need a spreadsheet filled with formulas to do this, either. Start simple: List your take-home pay and fixed expenses (housing, insurance and loan payments). Then look at your variable spending — things like groceries, subscriptions and takeout — and see where there's room to cut back or reallocate. Even a small shift, like canceling a $15 streaming service or eating out one less time per week, can free up funds you can redirect to savings or debt . More importantly, it creates forward momentum, and that can be powerful when you're feeling stuck. Learn about the debt relief options available to you now . Set a small financial goal — and automate it A major source of financial stress comes from feeling like you're not making progress. That's where goal setting comes in. Pick a goal that's achievable in the short term, whether that's saving $100, paying off a single credit card or building a $500 emergency cushion, and automate your way there. Even $10 or $25 a week can add up quickly if it's consistently stashed in a high-yield savings account . And, setting up automatic transfers removes the friction of decision-making and helps you prioritize your goal even when life gets busy. Be honest about what you can't control Financial stress often stems from uncertainty, like things you might owe, expenses that might pop up or economic shifts that are totally out of your hands. But trying to plan for every unknown can be paralyzing. Instead, focus on what you can control and acknowledge what you can't. You might not be able to predict whether a recession will hit this year, but you can shore up your finances by paying down high-rate debt or trimming unnecessary expenses. You might not be able to stop a layoff, but you can start building a small emergency fund or updating your resume just in case. That mental shift of moving from fear-based thinking to action-oriented steps can drastically reduce your anxiety, even if your financial picture hasn't changed yet. Prioritize your most urgent debt Debt is one of the most common sources of financial anxiety, and for good reason. With credit card APRs hovering above 21% on average, interest can rack up quickly and make balances feel unmanageable. So, if your debt is keeping you up at night, stop suffering in silence and start exploring your options . Begin by focusing on the accounts that are costing you the most. That usually means prioritizing high-rate credit cards. And, if you can't afford more than the minimums right now, consider a debt relief strategy that fits your situation. Some options to explore include: Debt consolidation loans , which can simplify your payments and lower your interest rate Debt management programs , which can help you streamline your payments and negotiate lower rates and fees with your creditors Debt settlement programs , which could reduce what you owe by 30% to 50% (on average) in return for a lump-sum payment Talk to someone about it Financial stress thrives in silence. Many people feel shame about their situation, which keeps them from reaching out, but there are a lot of people who are dealing with similar issues right now, and getting another perspective can make a big difference. You don't have to share your numbers with the world, but consider opening up to a trusted friend, family member or financial counselor. Sometimes just saying, ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed by money right now"" is enough to start the process of relief. And, if your financial stress is chronic or severe, a credit counseling agency or financial therapist can help you create a roadmap and tackle the emotional side of money stress. The bottom line Financial stress can feel suffocating, but it doesn't have to be permanent. Small, intentional actions like tracking your spending, addressing your debt and talking to someone about your stress, and the options you have to address it, can help you regain control and reduce anxiety. And remember: You don't have to do it all at once. Start with one step and build from there. The path to peace of mind may be closer than you think."

The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there.

Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia.

Here's what we know about the investigation.,18,1465,2025-07-29 17:15:37.116496,121,26,9,5,11,1,"What's known about the investigation, suspect in NYC office building shooting 03:21 Four people were killed in a shooting Monday evening inside a New York City office building. The gunman, who used a high-powered rifle to open fire in the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, later died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said. A New York City police officer was among those killed in the shooting, in addition to three civilians. Officials also said a man was hospitalized in critical condition. Police have identified the shooting suspect as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. Speaking Tuesday on ""CBS Mornings,"" New York City Mayor Eric Adams said investigators recovered a note in which Tamura appeared to blame his own traumatic head injury on the National Football League, which has offices in the building where the rampage took place. The tower at 345 Park Ave. contains offices for several other major corporations, including the accounting firm KPMG and the investment company Blackstone . President Trump said in a social media post that he had been briefed on the shooting, which he called ""tragic"" and ""a senseless act of violence."" Here's what we know so far about the incident and the investigation. What happened? Just before 6:30 p.m. on Monday, surveillance video showed the suspect, alone, exiting a black BMW that was double-parked on Manhattan's Park Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets, said New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch. In the video, the gunman is seen carrying an M4 rifle. The suspect then entered the 44-story high-rise at 345 Park Ave., turned right and opened fire on an NYPD officer who was in uniform working a private security job as part of an NYPD program. Surveillance footage shows the gunman exiting his black BMW on Park Avenue in Manhattan. Tisch said multiple 911 calls came in shortly afterward to report an active shooter inside the building . The gunman continued to open fire as he moved through the lobby, striking a woman who had tried to hide behind a pillar, officials said. Proceeding toward the lobby's elevator bank, he shot a security guard who had sought shelter behind a desk, in addition to another man who told police he had also been shot in the lobby, according to the NYPD commissioner. The suspect allowed a woman who stepped out of an elevator he was waiting to take to pass by unharmed, Tisch said. Then, he rode the elevator to the 33rd floor, where the offices for the building's owner Rudin Management are located. The commissioner said he ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" and struck one of the victims who eventually died. At that point, the gunman walked down the hallway and shot himself in the chest, Tisch said. The victims Didarul had two young sons and his wife is currently pregnant, Adams said at a news conference Monday night, praising him for his service on the police force and his character. ""He was an immigrant from Bangladesh and he loved this city,"" Adams said. ""And everyone we spoke with stated he was a person of faith and a person that believed in God and believed in living out the life of a godly person. He embodies what this city is all about."" In a statement, the NYPD said Didarul ""represented the very best of our department."" The three civilians killed in the shooting include the second security guard in the lobby and employees at Rudin Management and Blackstone. The security guard was identified as Aland Etienne. He was an unarmed security guard working for McLane Security Inc., according to 32BJ SEIU, a union representing property service workers. He had been in his role at the building on Park Avenue since 2019. In a statement, Blackstone identified one of the victims killed as their employee Wesley LePatner . ""Words cannot express the devastation we feel. Wesley was a beloved member of the Blackstone family and will be sorely missed,"" the statement said. ""She was brilliant, passionate, warm, generous, and deeply respected within our firm and beyond. She embodied the best of Blackstone. Our prayers are with her husband, children and family."" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told employees in an email Monday night that someone working for the league ""was seriously injured"" in the shooting. Goodell said that person had been hospitalized and his condition was considered stable. The suspect Police have shared preliminary details about Tamura, but a number of questions remained Tuesday. It appeared he had attempted to target the NFL offices located inside the Park Avenue tower but used the wrong elevator, and ended up on a different floor, Adams said. He told ""CBS Mornings"" on Tuesday that the shooter had a note on his person that referenced CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a brain disease caused by repeated trauma to the head. ""He did have a note on him,"" Adams said. ""The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury."" Tamura never played in the NFL, but local media coverage in Santa Clarita, California, in 2014 appear to show he played high school football. He had a documented mental health history, according to law enforcement in Las Vegas. Tamura worked an overnight security shift at the Horseshoe Casino in Las Vegas, an NYPD spokesperson said. He was last slated to work Sunday when he failed to show up. Tisch said Monday night that the gunman had driven across the country before arriving in New York City, traversing Colorado on Saturday, Nebraska and Iowa on Sunday, and New Jersey on Monday. Investigators found that his vehicle, the BMW he was seen exiting on Park Avenue, passed through Columbia, New Jersey, at 4:24 p.m. Monday afternoon. That car was registered to Tamura, according to the police commissioner. When officers searched the vehicle, they discovered a rifle case with rounds, a loaded revolver, ammunition and magazines, a backpack, and medication prescribed to the gunman. Tisch said no explosives were found. Parts of the gun used in the shooting were purchased by an associate of the gunman in Las Vegas, the NYPD spokesperson said. It wasn't immediately clear how he got the other parts to assemble the rifle or why the associate had to purchase some for him. A team of NYPD detectives has located the associate in Las Vegas and is interviewing him. The NYPD also plans to execute a search warrant on the gunman's home, the spokesperson said. The shooter did purchase the handgun found in his car legally with a concealed carry permit from a gun store in Las Vegas, the spokesperson said. ""A violent, despicable attack"" Multiple New York officials have spoken out in the wake of the shooting. Adams on Monday described it as ""a violent, despicable attack,"" adding, ""No words can describe this act of evil, a man who takes the life of others who are innocent. And no words can fill the void left by this tragedy."" New York Gov. Kathy Hochul called the shooting ""a horrific act of violence"" that exemplifies the need for stricter gun control in the United States. ""The killer used an AR-15–style assault rifle. The same weapon of war used in mass shootings across America,"" Hochul said in a statement, noting that although New York's gun laws are some of the strictest in the nation, regulations banning assault weapons and preventing potentially dangerous individuals from acquiring firearms ""only go so far when an AR-15 can be obtained in a state with weak gun laws and brought into New York to commit mass murder."" ""The time to act is now,"" Hochul continued. ""The American people are tired of thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. Congress must summon the courage to stand up to the gun lobby and finally pass a national assault weapons ban before more innocent lives are stolen."" Shooting New York City"

She can be as heartwarming in English (""Darkest Hour"") as she can be heartwrenching in French (""I've Loved You So Long""). Many of her foreign films have been showcased at the Cine Lumiere, a French art house in London. ""A little slice of Paris,"" she said. It's convenient, now that she's back in London, playing the deputy director of MI5 in the Apple TV+ series ""Slow Horses."" Actress Kristin Scott Thomas discusses her directorial debut, ""My Mother's Wedding."" A chilly, stiff upper-lip has often been a calling card for Thomas – too stiff, she admits, early on: ""I think it was Sydney Pollock – or it might have been Robert Redford, take your pick,"" she laughed. ""One of them said to me, 'You know, you have to be generous. Forget what you're trying to defend. Forget trying to hide. Be more generous.' And I'm not sure I really understood what he meant by that. He just planted a seed, and then I was able to kind of unzip a bit more."" And she about to unzip even more, creatively digging into something intensely personal in her past. She said, ""When I was five, my father was killed, and my mother remarried. And tragically, he was killed five years later. And I know that a lot of the time when I was a younger woman, I had this feeling of something missing, this piece of my puzzle missing having grown up with only one parent."" Both had been pilots in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm; both were lost in remarkably similar training accidents; and both left a hole that had her climbing out into her imagination. When she was a little girl she wrote and illustrated stories: ""A mommy and a daddy and two children, just doing ordinary things, like going away on holiday and things like that"" – a family experience she never knew. The memories of her dad were incomplete, fuzzy, like sketches she played out in her head. But those images became the seeds for what grew into a screenplay, and then came to life as the first movie she's ever directed: ""My Mother's Wedding."" It garnered an all-star cast: Scarlett Johansson, Sienna Miller and Emily Beecham play Thomas' daughters who are each struggling in different ways with the loss of a father or stepfather, just as their mother prepares to marry again. To watch a trailer for ""My Mother's Wedding"" click on the video player below: My Mother's Wedding | Official Trailer (HD) | Vertical by Vertical on YouTube Thomas has already done movie weddings, of course, as in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""

""I was excruciatingly shy,"" she said. ""I don't know when it changed, to be honest."" She's hardly shy anymore, if her character in ""Fleabag"" is any indication. Perhaps it's fitting she was discovered by another admittedly shy success story, Prince. You'd think that would make her a pretty cool mom (she has three children with her first husband), but it turns out … not so much. ""I hadn't watched it with them, but as I was leaving my teenage children alone one evening, and they were having pizza and a friend 'round, I said, 'Watch ""Under the Cherry Moon,"" it's on the telly! Come on, it'll be fun!' And when I got back, they weren't actually very polite about it."" Clockwise from top left: Kristin Scott Thomas with Prince in ""Under the Cherry Moon""; with Tom Cruise in ""Mission: Impossible""; with Robert Redford in ""The Horse Whisperer""; with Gary Oldman in ""Slow Horses""; with Claudie Blakley and Geraldine Somerville in ""Gosford Park""; and with Ralph Fiennes in ""The English Patient."" She has more than made up for it, later starring opposite Robert Redford (""The Horse Whisperer""), Harrison Ford (""Random Hearts""), and Tom Cruise (""Mission: Impossible""). ""I'm so proud to be in 'Mission: Impossible,' I cannot even get over it!"" she said. ""I'm in this thing, which is this enormous monster, and you know, these kids, they have no idea about 'Gosford Park.' They have no idea about 'Four Weddings,' but they've all seen 'Mission: Impossible'! And they have no idea I speak French or do all these other kind of slightly murkier films in France, you know?"" And then, of course, there was ""The English Patient,"" which earned her an Academy Award nomination for best actress. ""It's quite moving actually, when you see yourself at sort of 30 acting your socks off,"" she said. Another place she acted her socks off is at the Royal Court Theatre, where she won an Olivier Award for her performance in ""The Seagull,"" a role she later took to Broadway. ""New York audiences, when they are enjoying themselves, I mean it's electric – you can really, really feel it,"" she said. And London audiences? ""We are much more kind of passive, perhaps. Reserved. Of course we are!"" she laughed. But even while talking at the Royal Court, she found herself thinking about her film. As intimate as the stage may be, for her, ""My Mother's Wedding"" is more so. ""I love working on stage, as you can probably tell. I really, really love it. But the joy and satisfaction and exhaustion that comes from filmmaking when you are being a director, that is not far off. Pretty good. It's just extraordinary."" At 65, and now a grandmother, she's working as hard as ever, not taking a lot of time to smell the roses per se, but she'll surely stop for someone who has a kind word or two: ""A lady came up to me the other day and said, 'I know you hate this, but I just wanted to say...' and I said, 'I don't hate this at all!

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause.

Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote. Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to ""ensure accuracy and fairness,"" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create ""security risks and undermines the integrity of the process."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.""

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/,Health,2025-07-29 12:51:09-04:00,"Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling — CBS News analysis",15,944,2025-07-29 17:15:37.816568,118,23,8,3,10,2,"03:57 Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly declined — and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

A woman who also works in the area told the station, ""We rushed the window in the direction where the helicopters are going, and then, we look and there's cop cars everywhere, and then someone pulls up Twitter and we find out that there is an active shooter."" The building houses the headquarters of the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment firms, and has numerous other well-known tenants. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the gunman appeared to have been targeting the NFL offices. ""He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,"" Adams said on ""CBS Mornings"" Tuesday. A perimeter was blocked off around the building for blocks in every direction. NYPD officers and caution tape warned passersby away. Helicopters passed overhead for hours. People were told to shelter in place in buildings in the vicitniity. A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting. Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday. A young man who moved to New York only two weeks ago to work for Bank of America came to check out the scene. At an building nearby, people were ordering in late takeout food and gathering in the lobby. They told of colleagues who'd stepped out to get food as it was happening, not realizing what was going on down the block. Even hours after the shooting, one young woman seemed unsure if it was safe to leave.

Angelina Katsanis / AP Late into the night, the streets were ablaze with flashing lights from police and FDNY vehicles lining the scene's perimeter. Local TV footage showed lines of people evacuating the office building where the shootings took place with their hands above their heads in the hours after the killings, according to The Associated Press. Nekeisha Lewis was eating dinner with friends on the nearby plaza when she heard gunfire. ""It felt like it was a quick two shots and then it was rapid fire,"" she told the AP. Windows shattered and a man ran from the building saying, ""Help, help. I'm shot."" Lewis said. Kyle Marshall, 38, was working at a nearby Morgan Stanley office when his mother texted him about an active-shooter incident, asking if he was OK, Reuters reports. ""Then she texted me the address, and I was, like, 'Oh my God. That's right next door to my building,'"" he said. Marshall lives in the San Francisco area but comes to New York monthly for work. ""It doesn't make me feel less safe to be in Manhattan,"" he said. ""The police responded quickly."" Shooting Mass Shooting New York City"

In a 51-48 vote, Republicans Susan Collins, of Maine, and Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, joined Democrats in opposing the package. Vice President JD Vance, who cast two tie-breaking votes Tuesday for the measure to clear procedural hurdles, was not needed for final passage. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith of Minnesota was hospitalized and missed the vote. Both chambers need to approve the request before it expires at the end of the week, or the funds will have to be spent as lawmakers previously intended. The House approved the original $9.4 billion rescissions request last month, but it faced pushback in the Senate, where some Republicans opposed slashing global health assistance and funding for local radio and television stations. The Senate began the lengthy vote series Wednesday afternoon, rejecting dozens of amendments on retaining international aid and sparing public broadcasting from cuts. The Senate's version targets roughly $8 billion for foreign assistance programs, including the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID. The package also includes about $1 billion in cuts for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which supports public radio and television stations, including NPR and PBS. Senate Republicans met with Mr. Trump's budget director, Russell Vought, on Tuesday as GOP leaders worked to get holdouts on board ahead of the procedural votes later in the day. Vought left the meeting saying there would be a substitute amendment that would eliminate $400 million in cuts to an AIDS prevention program, one of Collins' main concerns. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, said he hoped the House would accept the ""small modification."" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, walks from the Senate floor to his office at the Capitol on July 16, 2025. When asked about the $400 million change, House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters ""we wanted them to pass it unaltered like we did."" ""We need to claw back funding, and we'll do as much as we're able,"" Johnson added. But the change did not satisfy Collins and Murkowski. The holdouts said the administration's request lacks details about how the cuts will be implemented. ""To carry out our Constitutional responsibility, we should know exactly what programs are affected and the consequences of rescissions,"" Collins said in a statement Tuesday. In a floor speech ahead of the procedural votes, Murkowski also said Congress should not give up its budget oversight. ""I don't want us to go from one reconciliation bill to a rescissions package to another rescissions package to a reconciliation package to a continuing resolution,"" she said. ""We're lawmakers. We should be legislating. What we're getting now is a direction from the White House and being told, 'This is the priority, we want you to execute on it, we'll be back with you with another round.' I don't accept that."" Cuts to local radio and television stations , especially in rural areas where they are critical for communicating emergency messages, were another point of contention in the Senate. Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, of South Dakota, who had concerns about the cuts, said funding would be reallocated from climate funds to keep stations in tribal areas operating ""without interruption."" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, of North Carolina, who voted for the package, said he expected that Congress would have to try later to fix some of the cuts once their impacts are determined. ""I suspect we're going to find out there are some things that we're going to regret,"" he said Wednesday on the Senate floor. ""I suspect that when we do we'll have to come back and fix it, similar to what I'm trying to do with the bill I voted against a couple of weeks ago — the so-called Big, Beautiful Bill, that I think we're going to have to go back and work on.""

A deposition was scheduled for Aug. 11 at a federal prison in Tallahassee, where Maxwell is serving her sentence. However, in a letter Tuesday addressed to House Oversight chairman Rep. James Comer, Maxwell's attorney David Markus said she is willing to sit before the committee but only after certain legal appeals are finalized or his client is granted clemency or a pardon by President Trump. ""Public reports — including your own statements — indicate that the Committee intends to question Ms. Maxwell in prison and without a grant of immunity. Those are non-starters. Ms. Maxwell cannot risk further criminal exposure in a politically charged environment without formal immunity,"" Markus wrote. Markus wrote that any questions to Maxwell would have to be given to her in advance to ""ensure accuracy and fairness,"" and that conducting the deposition in prison would create ""security risks and undermines the integrity of the process."" Maxwell was convicted in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls. She is serving a 20-year prison sentence . Epstein died in federal custody in 2019 as he faced sex trafficking charges. His death was ruled a suicide. Markus wrote that because Maxwell's ongoing appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn her conviction and other legal issues are currently pending, ""any testimony she provides now could compromise her constitutional rights, prejudice her legal claims, and potentially taint a future jury pool."" However, Markus wrote, if President Trump were to pardon Maxwell or commute her sentence, ""she would be willing—and eager—to testify openly and honestly, in public, before Congress in Washington, D.C."" If those conditions are not agreed to, Markus wrote, Maxwell ""will have no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights."" A spokesperson for the House Oversight Committee said in a statement that the committee will respond to Markus' letter ""soon,"" but said it ""will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony."" In a letter to Maxwell informing her of the subpoena, Comer wrote that the committee is seeking Maxwell's testimony ""to inform the consideration of potential legislative solutions to improve federal efforts to combat sex trafficking and reform the use of non-prosecution agreements and/or plea agreements in sex-crime investigations.""

Todd Blanche, the second highest-ranking Justice Department official, met with Maxwell in Tallahassee on July 24 and 25 to discuss Epstein. After the questioning had ended, Markus declined to comment ""on the substance"" of the meeting, but told reporters outside the office that ""there were a lot of questions and we went all day."" Neither President Trump nor Markus have ruled out the possibility of a pardon for Maxwell, but on Monday Mr. Trump said he is ""allowed"" to pardon Maxwell but that nobody has asked him to issue one, yet.

Authorities began pursuing a speedboat heading towards the island with several people on board after determining it to be suspicious, local news outlet Acento reported . Helicopters, boats and cars were involved in the chase, which began Monday off the country's south coast near Pedernales. It ended with the arrest of three Dominicans and one Colombian, Devers said. Image released by the National Drug Control Directorate of the Dominican Republic (DNCDRD) shows the speedboat.

Authorities also seized items including a cellphone, 13 jerrycans of fuel, a small cooler filled with water and food, and a backpack with a change of clothes. The Dominican Republic has long been considered a major drug transit point, with some of the shipments bound for Europe. The largest seizure in the country's history happened last year in December when authorities seized nearly 9.5 tons of cocaine worth $250 million. Overall, officials seized more than 46 tons of drugs last year. The second biggest seizure was reported in 2006, with 2.8 tons of cocaine found at Caucedo port.

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."

Alford was principal deputy assistant attorney general and Rinner served as a deputy assistant attorney general and head of merger enforcement. Both officials served in the antitrust division during President Trump's first term. It was unclear why they were fired, but sources said insubordination was cited in the dismissals. The two officials had been placed on administrative leave last week. Earlier this month, internal friction within the Justice Department's antitrust team led to private conversations in the Trump administration about whether to push out some staff or to work to smooth out the issues, according to multiple sources familiar with the situation. There has been tension over the handling of investigations into T-Mobile, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and others, sources said. The antitrust division is one of two agencies that protects competition in markets by enforcing the antitrust laws that regulate mergers and business practices that harm consumers, along with the Federal Trade Commission. Slater, who entered her role in high regard both in MAGA circles and among left-leaning watchdogs, hasn't adopted a block-every-merger approach. But some Trump officials have vented that it has taken a substantial amount of internal push-and-pull to land on decisions to reach deals that resolve merger issues, three of the sources said."

A psychologist shares tips for better sleep.,13,957,2025-07-29 17:15:39.366735,113,44,4,25,13,1,"Why aging affects sleep and expert tips to improve it 04:54 About 10% of Americans say they have chronic insomnia , and millions of others report poor sleep quality. Ongoing research has found that bad sleep could lead to numerous health problems, including heart disease . Dr. Julio Fernandez-Mendoza is a professor of psychiatry and behavioral health, neuroscience and public health sciences at Penn State College of Medicine. He discusses the need for sleep, why teenagers require more sleep than adults, and how you can get a good night's sleep without medications. The Conversation has collaborated with SciLine to bring you highlights from the discussion that have been edited for brevity and clarity. How much sleep is enough for adults and for adolescents? Julio Fernandez-Mendoza: Adults who report getting about seven to eight hours of sleep per night generally have the best health , in terms of both physical and mental health, and longevity. But that recommendation changes with age . Adults over age 65 may need just six to seven hours of sleep per night. So older people, if otherwise healthy, should not feel anxious if they're getting just six hours. Young people need the most – at least nine hours – and some younger children may need more. How can insufficient sleep harm our health? Fernandez-Mendoza: Our team was the first to show that those complaining about insomnia – difficulty falling or staying asleep – were more likely to have high blood pressure and be at risk for heart disease . In both teens and adults, we found that insomnia and shortened sleep may lead to elevated stress, hormone levels and inflammation . These problems tend to show up before you develop heart disease . As we age, the recommended amount of sleep declines. National Sleep Foundation What about people who have more serious sleep problems? Fernandez-Mendoza: Good sleep hygiene habits include cutting down on caffeine and alcohol, quitting smoking and exercising regularly. I also recommend not skipping meals, not eating too late at night and not eating too much. But people with a persistent sleep problem may need to make more behavioral changes. Research studies point to a set of six rules that can improve your sleep. You can follow these changes consistently in the short term, and then choose how to adapt them into your lifestyle down the road. First, get up at the same time no matter what. No matter how much sleep you get. This will anchor your sleep/wake cycle, called your circadian rhythm . Second, do not use your bed for anything except sleep and sexual activity. Third, when you can't sleep, don't lie in bed awake. Instead, get out of bed, go into another room if you can, and do an activity that's enjoyable or relaxing. Go back to bed only when you're ready to sleep. Fourth, get going with daily activities even after a poor night's sleep. Don't try to compensate for sleep loss. If you have chronic insomnia, don't nap, sleep in, or doze during the day or evening even after poor sleep the previous night. Fifth, go to bed only when you're actually sleepy enough to fall asleep. And sixth, start with the amount of sleep you're now getting – with the lowest limit at five hours – and then increase it weekly by 15 minutes. These six rules are evidence-based and go above and beyond simple sleep hygiene habits. If they don't work, see a provider who can help you. Do you have advice specifically for adolescents? Fernandez-Mendoza: Adolescence is a unique developmental period. It's not just the obvious physical, emotional and behavioral changes that occur during adolescence and puberty – there are changes in a teenager's brain that can alter their sleep patterns. When an adolescent goes through puberty, their internal clock changes so that their sleep schedule shifts to later hours . While it's true that adolescents are more engaged at night because of their social relationships, there's also biology behind why they want to stay up late – their internal clocks have shifted. It's not just choice. School start times for most adolescents are at odds with that biological shift . So they don't get enough sleep, which affects their performance in school. Research suggests that schools with later start times are more closely aligned with the science on child development and don't put adolescents at risk by making them wake up earlier than their bodies are biologically inclined to. Parents can help their teens get better sleep. Set a time for kids to stop doing homework and put away electronics . Instead, they can watch TV with the family or read – something relaxing and enjoyable that will help them wind down before bed. You can also gradually move back their wake-up time. Start on weekends, waking them up 30 minutes earlier every day, including school days, until the child reaches the desired wake-up time. Don't try to reshift them suddenly – for example, waking up a teenager at 5 a.m. like it's the military – because that doesn't work. They won't get used to it, since it's at odds with their internal clock. So, do it little by little. If that doesn't work, see a clinical provider. What kind of treatments can a sleep clinician provide? Fernandez-Mendoza: People should get help if they feel they sleep poorly, if they're fatigued during the day, or if they snore or grind their teeth. All these issues deserve attention. Some people may think a sleep provider just prescribes expensive medication, but that's not true. There are behavioral, non-drug-based treatments that work. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment recommended for insomnia . Light therapy may also help, which is the use of a bright light therapy lamp at a given time during the day or evening, depending on the person's sleep problem. Watch the full interview to hear more.

The president's physician, Sean Barbabella, said in a memo that the president underwent a thorough health examination after he noticed mild swelling in his legs, and it revealed no evidence of a more serious condition like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt read the memo at Thursday's press briefing, and the White House later released it. According to Johns Hopkins and the Cleveland Clinic, chronic venous insufficiency occurs when veins in the legs struggle to bring blood back up to the heart. Barbarella said the president, who is 79, remains in ""excellent"" overall health . Photos of the president at the Club World Cup soccer final in New Jersey over the weekend showed him with noticeably swollen ankles, fueling speculation about the cause. First lady Melania Trump, President Donald Trump, FIFA President Gianni Infantino and his wife Leena Al Ashqar watch the second half of the Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on Sunday, July 13, 2025. Pamela Smith / AP The president's doctor said he was ""thoroughly evaluated"" by the White House medical unit ""out of an abundance of caution"" after noticing swelling in recent weeks. ""The president underwent a comprehensive examination, including diagnostic vascular studies. Bilateral lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasounds were performed and revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a benign and common condition, particularly in individuals over the age of 70,"" the memo said. Barbarella said there was ""no evidence"" of blood clots or arterial disease. The president underwent multiple tests, including a complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and coagulation profile, Barbabella said. ""All results were within normal limits,"" the memo said. ""An echocardiogram was also performed and confirmed normal cardiac structure and function. No signs of heart function, renal impairment, or systemic illness were identified."" The White House doctor also noted recent photos that have shown minor bruising on the back of the president's hand. ""This is consistent with minor soft tissue irritation from frequent handshaking and the use of aspirin, which is taken as part of a standard cardiovascular prevention regimen,"" the memo said. What is chronic venous insufficiency? Chronic venous insufficiency, also known as CVI, is a form of venous disease that occurs when veins in your legs are damaged, resulting in them not managing blood flow back to the heart as well as they should. ""Chronic venous insufficiency is not a serious health threat. But it can be painful and disabling,"" Johns Hopkins Medicine notes on its website. Venous disease in general is very common, according to the Cleveland Clinic , with about 1 in 20 adults being affected by chronic venous insufficiency. It usually affects people over age 50, with the risk increasing with age. Someone who is overweight, has a family history of the issue, or who has prior leg damage can be more at risk. Other contributing factors can include lack of exercise, smoking and high blood pressure in the leg veins due to long periods of sitting or standing. The insufficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including discolored reddish-brown, leathery or itchy skin, swelling in the legs and ankles, and legs that are achy, tired, cramping or tingling. Treatment options can include improving blood flow through weight loss, exercise, elevation and compression socks, and in some cases, medicines or minor procedures may be recommended. In severe cases, surgery is also an option. Read the full memo on Trump's diagnosis A letter from the president's physician, released July 17, 2025. White House Donald Trump"

The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there. ""Ten days from today. Okay?"" he said on the plane. ""And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,"" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could."" The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window , the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia. Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia. ""I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'"" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. ""And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything."" It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin ""wants peace."" On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-revoke-endangerment-finding-regulating-greenhouse-gases/,MoneyWatch,2025-07-29 15:31:54-04:00,"EPA to revoke ""endangerment finding,"" landmark basis for regulating greenhouse gases",11,1228,2025-07-29 17:15:39.782046,118,32,3,12,10,0,"Details on Trump EPA proposal to roll back Biden-era pollution limits 03:51 The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

If you aren't dealing with your tax debt right away, these types of issues can snowball quickly. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a lot of power when it comes to collecting what's owed. So, what started as a simple oversight on your taxes or a financial hardship that kept you from paying your tax bill can quickly evolve into a complex situation involving penalties, interest and potentially aggressive collection tactics . As the penalties and interest pile up, many taxpayers will turn to professional tax relief services in hopes of reducing their tax liability and avoiding more serious legal consequences. These services employ experienced tax professionals who can help you resolve your tax issues by working with the IRS on your behalf, potentially securing settlements for less than you owe, or arranging manageable payment plans . But while tax relief can provide much-needed assistance, it's important to understand that these services come at an extra cost. Below, we'll break down those costs to help better determine if this service is affordable (and worth it) for you. See how a tax relief service could help with your tax debt now . How much does tax relief cost? The price tag for tax relief services varies by company, just as any other service would. And, the complexity of your tax situation, the amount you owe and the specific resolution strategy needed can also play a role in the cost you face for this type of service. That said, many tax relief companies employ a two-phase fee structure: an initial investigation fee followed by resolution fees. Initial investigation fees typically range from a few hundred dollars to over $1,500, depending on the company you choose and other factors. During this phase, the company reviews your tax documents, assesses your situation and outlines potential solutions. Resolution fees are substantially higher, ranging, in general, from $1,000 to $10,000 or more for complex cases. Many of these companies will calculate these fees as a percentage of your tax debt (typically 10% to 15%). However, some charge hourly rates that can differ depending on whether you're working with an enrolled agent, CPA or tax attorney. For example, someone with a $50,000 tax debt might pay approximately $500 to $1,000 for the initial investigation and $5,000 to $7,500 for full resolution services. This represents a significant investment, especially for someone who already owes a hefty amount to the IRS . Some companies offer financing options, but those could come with additional interest costs. Other costs may also materialize during the process. Some companies charge for expenses like filing fees, transcript fees or other issues discovered during the investigation. Or, some charge additional fees if your case requires appealing IRS decisions or involves specialized negotiation tactics. In other words, the fine print matters tremendously in these agreements. Learn more about tax relief service benefits now . Is a tax relief service worth the extra costs? The value proposition of tax relief services hinges on whether they can secure outcomes substantially better than what you could achieve independently. In some scenarios, professional representation delivers clear advantages that justify their fees. For example, taxpayers with complex cases involving multiple years of unfiled returns, business tax issues or potential criminal exposure can benefit significantly from specialized expertise . After all, these tax professionals bring deep knowledge of tax code intricacies and negotiation strategies that can result in more favorable settlements. Their familiarity with IRS procedures often expedites resolution and reduces stress for taxpayers. However, for simpler cases, the cost-benefit analysis can shift. The IRS offers several do-it-yourself resolution options that taxpayers can access directly without representation. For example, the Fresh Start program specifically aims to make these programs more accessible to ordinary taxpayers. So, someone with a straightforward situation and modest debt might obtain similar results independently while saving money on fees — though in many cases, hiring professional help, even for less complex matters, can result in better outcomes. The bottom line Tax relief services occupy a legitimate place in the financial services ecosystem but still require careful consideration before engagement. Their costs can, in some cases, be substantial and should be weighed against realistic expectations of outcomes. Ultimately, the most successful engagements tend to occur when taxpayers approach tax relief with informed expectations rather than hopes of miraculous outcomes. While professional representation won't make tax debts magically disappear, it can provide meaningful relief through properly executed resolution strategies, protection from aggressive collection tactics and the peace of mind that comes from resolving a significant financial burden properly."

In a statement on Tuesday, Novo Nordisk said it expects its sales for 2025 to grow 8%-14%, down from projections of 13%-21% in May. It also lowered its expectations for operating profit growth to 10%-16%, down from 16%-24% in May. The updated outlook ""reflects the persistent use of compounded GLP-1s, slower-than-expected market expansion and competition,"" the company said. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists (GLP-1s), a class of drugs used to manage diabetes, have upended the weight-loss industry. The Danish pharmaceutical company also announced on Tuesday the appointment of Maziar Mike Doustdar as president and CEO. Doustdar , who has worked at Novo Nordisk for over 30 years, will take the helm starting on Aug. 7. Doustdar will succeed Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen, who announced his departure as CEO of Novo Nordisk in May, following a steep decline in the company's share price, which has dropped nearly 37% since the start of this year. Reached for comment, a Novo Nordisk spokesperson said they did not have anything additional to share before the company's earnings call, which is scheduled for Wednesday, Aug. 6. Copycat drugs pervade market While global sales of Wegovy are growing, sales of the weight-loss drug are expected to weaken in certain markets due to increased competition from compounded versions of the drug. Compounded weight-loss drugs have the same active ingredients as Wegovy and other popular brands such as Ozempic, and are used as substitutes when the name-brand drugs aren't available. However, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in April said there is no longer a shortage of GLP-1s and ordered compounding pharmacies to stop selling their copycat versions of the popular weight-loss drugs. Despite efforts to stymie them, however, compounded versions of the drugs continue to penetrate the market, giving consumers a cheaper option to name-brands like Wegovy, which can cost more than $1000 per package for those without insurance. In June, Novo Nordisk ended its partnership with Hims & Hers Health over claims that the online drug retailer was selling fake versions of Wegovy, a move Novo Nordisk said ""put patient safety at risk."" Novo Nordisk said it is pursuing multiple avenues to ""protect patients from knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs"" including litigation. Semaglutide is the active ingredient found in Wegovy and Ozempic. ""Novo Nordisk is deeply concerned that, without aggressive intervention by federal and state regulators and law enforcement, patients will continue to be exposed to the significant risks posed by knockoff 'semaglutide' drugs made with illicit or inauthentic foreign active pharmaceutical ingredients,"" the company said in its statement ."

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day? Best sources of iron other than red meat Connelly's suggestions for plant-based iron sources include: Lentils Beans Tofu Pumpkin seeds Spinach Certain seafoods are also great choices, she added, including: Oysters Clams Sardines Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of The Nutrition Changer , said another important source of iron in the United States if fortified breads and cereals. According to the National Institutes of Health , about half of dietary iron comes from bread, cereal and other grain products in the U.S. Iron found in plant-based sources like nuts and beans, however, need to be transformed before our bodies can absorb it, Jiang explained, adding it's best to pair plant-based iron with vitamin C-rich foods to boost absorption. Still worried you're not getting enough iron? Supplements are another option to consider after consulting your doctor, experts said. ""Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources,"" Jiang said.

The Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, said it will need 12 to 15 years of preparation – or until 2037 or later – before starting the full-scale removal of melted fuel debris at the No. 3 reactor. The preparation, it said, includes reducing radiation levels and building necessary facilities in and around the reactor. The Unit 3 reactor, covered with protective housing at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, is run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings (TEPCO). Eugene Hoshiko / AP Overall, at least 800 tons of melted nuclear fuel have mixed with broken parts of internal structures and other debris inside the three reactors that suffered meltdowns after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The delay again sets back the 2051 target set by Japan's government and TEPCO for decommissioning the plant. A test retrieval of a tiny sample of melted fuel debris in November was already three years behind, and some experts estimate that the decommissioning work could take more than a century. TEPCO said it plans to stick to the current completion target of 2051. ""Realistically, we are aware of the difficulty (to achieve the target) but we will not drop the goal just yet, as we still don't have a clear work schedule after the full-scale removal begins,"" said Akira Ono, chief decommissioning officer at TEPCO. Ono said TEPCO plans to examine preparation work necessary at the two other reactors within the next couple of years, ahead of full-scale melted fuel retrieval. After small missions by robots to gather samples, experts will determine a larger-scale method for removing melted fuel, first at the No. 3 reactor. In March 2024, TEPCO released a dozen images taken by the miniature drones sent deep into a badly damaged reactor at the plant, showing displaced control equipment and misshapen materials.

Addressing reporters at Downing Street, the prime minister said the U.K. will recognize Palestine as a state at the United Nations General Assembly in September unless Israel takes a number of steps — including the establishment of a ceasefire in Gaza, a commitment to halting the annexation of territory in the West Bank, and a pledge to work toward a peace process involving a two-state solution. ""Meanwhile, our message to the terrorists of Hamas is unchanged and unequivocal. They must immediately release all of the hostages, sign up to a ceasefire, disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of Gaza,"" Starmer added. Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer makes an address following an emergency cabinet meeting on Gaza at 10 Downing Street in London on July 29, 2025. Speaking at the U.N. headquarters in New York moments after Starmer had finished speaking, British Foreign Minister David Lammy said the U.K. government had taken this decision as the ""two-state solution is in peril."" ""Let me be clear — the Netanyahu government's rejection of a two-state solution is wrong. It's wrong morally and it's wrong strategically. It harms the interest of the Israeli people, closing off the only path to a just and lasting peace, and that is why we are determined to protect the viability of a two-state solution,"" Lammy said. In a statement on X, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu criticized the U.K.'s decision, writing that ""Starmer rewards Hamas's monstrous terrorism & punishes its victims."" ""A jihadist state on Israel's border TODAY will threaten Britain TOMORROW. Appeasement towards jihadist terrorists always fails. It will fail you too. It will not happen,"" Netanyahu said. Israel's Foreign Ministry also condemned the decision by the U.K. and called it a ""reward for Hamas"" that ""harms efforts to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza and a framework for the release of hostages."" Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/,Sports,2025-07-29 12:51:09-04:00,"Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling — CBS News analysis",15,944,2025-07-29 17:15:40.491191,118,23,8,3,10,2,"03:57 Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly declined — and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasts off from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California carrying seven satellites, including NASA's twin TRACERS probes, SpaceX Hitching a ride to space along with TRACERS atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket were five other small satellites, including one that will use a new ""polylingual"" terminal to communicate with multiple other satellites and space probes using different protocols. Another will collect data about how much solar energy Earth absorbs and reemits into space, known as the ""radiation budget,"" and another that will focus on how high-energy ""killer electrons"" are knocked out of the Van Allen radiation belts to rain down into the atmosphere. Two other small satellites were aboard, including an experimental ""cubesat"" that will test high-speed 5G communications technology in space and another built by an Australian company carrying five small satellites to test space-based air-traffic management technology that could provide aircraft tracking and communications anywhere in the world. The mission got underway at 2:13 p.m. EDT when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket roared to life at launch complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base on the California coast. The launching one day late because of a regional power outage Tuesday that interrupted air traffic communications over the Pacific Ocean near Vandenberg. The second time around, the countdown ticked smoothly to zero and after boosting the upper stage and payloads out of the lower atmosphere, the first stage peeled away, reversed course and flew back to a landing near the launch pad. A camera mounted on the Falcon 9's second stage shows the reusable first stage falling away and heading back to landing at Vandenberg, SpaceX's 27th booster recovery in California and its 479th overall. SpaceX A few seconds later, the upper stage engine shut down to put the vehicle in its planned preliminary orbit. The two satellites making up the primary TRACERS payload were deployed about an hour-and-a-half after launch. Two of the other smallsats were to be released earlier in a slightly different orbit, with the remainder following TRACERS a few minutes later. TRACERS is an acronym for Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites. The twin spacecraft, built by Boeing, will fly in tandem in the same orbit, 10 seconds to two minutes apart, helping researchers precisely measure rapid changes indicating how the solar wind ""couples"" with Earth's magnetic field. ""So the Sun is a burning, fiery ball of plasma and as it burns, it blows off an exhaust that we call the solar wind, it's a plasma, and that's always streaming from the sun towards the Earth,"" said David Miles, principal investigator at the University of Iowa. ""And sometimes, the magnetic field of the Earth basically stands it off in the same way that if you have a rock in a stream, the water kind of flows around it. But other times, those two systems couple (and) you dump mass, energy and momentum into the Earth system.""

With two identical satellites, scientists expect to measure rapid changes in the near-Earth space environment as the solar wind interacts with Earth's magnetic field.

""So what we're looking at trying to understand is how the coupling between those systems changes in space and in time,"" Miles said. The goals of the other satellites launched Wednesday range from basic science to technology development. The Polylingual Experimental Terminal, or PExT, will test equipment capable of sending and receiving data from multiple government and commercial satellites across multiple communications protocols. The goal is to streamline communications to and from a wide variety of satellites and space probes to improve efficiency and lower costs. The first of two TRACERS satellites is released to fly on its own. (SpaceX) SpaceX Another satellite, known as Athena-EPIC, will continue ongoing measurements of Earth's radiation budget, the balance between solar energy coming into Earth's environment compared to the energy radiated back out into space. Using spare parts from earlier missions, Athena-EPIC will test innovative LEGO-like satellite components intended to lower costs while reducing the size of satellites. The Relativistic Atmospheric Loss, or REAL, satellite, another small cubesat, will study how electrons in the Van Allen radiation belts get knocked out of place to pose threats to satellites and other systems. Robyn Millan of Dartmouth College is the principal investigator. ""The radiation belts are a region surrounding the Earth that are filled with high-energy charged particles that are traveling at near the speed of light,"" she said. ""These are sometimes called killer electrons because these particles are a hazard for our satellites in space. They also rain down on our atmosphere where they can contribute to ozone destruction."" The REAL cubesat weighs less than 10 pounds and measures just a foot long. Despite its small size, ""it carries a powerful particle sensor that will for the first time make very rapid measurements of these electrons as they enter our atmosphere, and this is really critical for understanding what's scattering them."" What makes REAL unique, she said, was the sensor's small size, allowing it to be carried by a cubesat, which ""could enable future missions, especially those requiring constellations of satellites.""

Efforts are underway to save the third-largest barrier reef system in the world, including the use of lab-grown corals and the removal of healthy corals , but scientists are now trying a method that they say has never been done before. The Elkhorn coral. There are dozens of stony coral species along Florida's 350 miles of reefs, from the Florida Keys up to the St. Lucie Inlet. Two of them are listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, according to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection , one of which is the Elkhorn coral. The Elkhorn species helps form the skeleton of a healthy reef, but according to Baker, more than 95% of the Elkhorn coral off Florida has been wiped out by a combination of factors, including rising temperatures fueled by climate change, increased coastal development and disease outbreaks ""Over the last 50 years or so, we've lost more of these Elkhorn corals, culminating in 2023 when we had this really warm summer,"" Baker said. ""And in order for that population to recover, it was determined that we need more diversity from outside the Florida population."" So, scientists and conservationists started looking off the Caribbean coast in Honduras, specifically Tela Bay, where Elkhorn coral live in ""the kind of conditions where corals have to be really tough to survive,"" Baker said. Scientist collects a Honduran elkhorn fragment in Tela Bay. To crossbreed the Elkhorns, scientists with Tela Marine, a Honduras-based aquarium and marine research center, carefully plucked coral from the reef in Honduras. Permits were then needed to transport the coral fragments into the U.S. Once they arrived in Florida, scientists with the University of Miami and the Florida Aquarium in Tampa worked to create the ""Flonduran"" Elkhorn, as it was nicknamed by Baker. Earlier this month, the crossbred species were planted for the first time in Florida, underneath protective umbrellas to deter predators. ""And if these corals can live through the next marine heat wave, then that is critical for our coastal protection on the coast of Florida,"" said Keri O'Neil, the director of coral conservation at the Florida Aquarium.

Speaking to reporters on Air Force One on Tuesday, President Trump said he did not discuss the decision with Starmer during their bilateral meeting in Scotland a day before the announcement. Seated alongside Starmer on Monday, Mr. Trump addressed the situation in Gaza , saying the U.S. will be providing food to the people of Gaza and working to eliminate barriers to humanitarian aid. ""Some of those kids are, that's real starvation stuff,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""I see it. And you can't fake that. So we're going to be even more involved. He added: ""I told Israel maybe they have to do it a different way."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said in a statement that Starmer spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the phone regarding the announcement on Tuesday. ""He [Starmer] said that the situation in Gaza was intolerable and that the need for humanitarian access is now more pressing than ever before. He urged the Prime Minister to take immediate action to lift all restrictions on aid access and get those suffering in Gaza the food they need,"" the spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman for Starmer's office said the prime minister had also spoken over the phone with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, as well as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, and King Abdullah II of Jordan about the U.K.'s plan to recognize Palestinian statehood. Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would recognize Palestine as a state and would formalize that decision at the U.N. General Assembly in September. ""Consistent with its historic commitment to a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, I have decided that France will recognize the State of Palestine,"" Macron said at the time. ""The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and to bring relief to the civilian population."" Netanyahu said Israel ""strongly"" condemned that decision and said that it ""rewards terror and risks creating another Iranian proxy, just as Gaza became."" ""A Palestinian state in these conditions would be a launch pad to annihilate Israel — not to live in peace beside it. Let's be clear: the Palestinians do not seek a state alongside Israel; they seek a state instead of Israel,"" the Israeli leader said in a post on X. That announcement came as pressure has mounted on Israel to allow more aid into Gaza as images of starving Palestinian children have garnered widespread global attention over the past week. The international pressure led Israel over the weekend to announce measures, including daily humanitarian pauses in fighting in parts of Gaza and airdrops. France's top diplomat, Jean-Noël Barrot, hailed the U.K. prime minister's announcement Tuesday in a social media post. ""Together, through this pivotal decision and our combined efforts, we break the endless cycle of violence and reopen the prospect of peace in the region,"" Barrot said. The Palestinian Ministry of Foreign Affairs lists 149 countries that currently recognise the state of Palestine. That number would rise to 151 should France and the U.K. formalize recognition of Palestine as a state in September. At least 60,000 Palestinians have been killed since the Israel-Hamas conflict began, according to the most recent figures released by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Israel Gaza United Kingdom"

Several sources said Mr. Trump indicated he will do it. Mr. Trump on Wednesday confirmed to reporters in the Oval Office that he spoke to lawmakers about ousting Powell. ""I talked to them about the concept of firing him. I said, 'What do you think?' Almost all of them said I should. But I'm more conservative than they are,"" he said. The idea of a president removing a Fed chair is legally untested — federal law says the chair can only be fired ""for cause."" The action could have serious negative effects on financial markets. Asked Wednesday if he wants Powell investigated for fraud related to the renovations of the Fed headquarters, Mr. Trump said, ""Well, I think he's already under investigation. He spent far more money than he was supposed to rebuilding."" ""I think he's, you know, he's got some problems,"" Mr. Trump said. He added there are ""many people"" who want the chair role. Russ Vought, the Office of Budget and Management director, sent a letter last week to Powell accusing him of an ""ostentatious"" yearslong office renovation project that may be ""violating the law."" In testimony to the Senate last month, Powell called some descriptions of the renovation project ""misleading and inaccurate."" The Trump administration has tried to increase the pressure on Powell, with some administration officials publicly accusing the Fed of mismanaging a multibillion-dollar project to renovate its Washington headquarters — an allegation Powell has pushed back on . For decades, Federal Reserve leaders have operated with a high degree of independence from the rest of the government, allowing them to make decisions about the nation's monetary policy with little input from politicians. Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, one of the Republicans who voted against advancing the crypto legislation, wrote in an X post Tuesday night, ""Hearing Jerome Powell is getting fired! From a very serious source."" In a later post, she wrote, ""I'm 99% sure firing is imminent."" Several lawmakers in the Oval meeting declined to comment, saying the discussion was private. White House spokespeople didn't immediately comment. But a spokesperson for the committee's chairman, Rep. French Hill, said the meeting was canceled due to uncertainty with vote timing in the House. Hill said the meeting had been scheduled months ago to introduce freshman members of the committee to Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump's dissatisfaction with Powell, and his view that the Federal Reserve is not acting quickly enough to cut interest rates, has been a frequent topic of discussion for the president in recent weeks. Mr. Trump has nicknamed Powell — who was first elevated to the role of Fed chair by Mr. Trump — ""Mr. Too Late."" ""I think he's terrible,"" Mr. Trump told reporters Tuesday. ""You talk to the guy, it's like talking to a — nothing. It's like talking to a chair. No personality."" ""I think he's a total stiff. But the one thing I didn't see him is a guy that needed a palace to live in,"" he said, referring to the building renovation. Last month, Mr. Trump insisted he wouldn't force Powell out, though he has called on Powell to resign before his term as chair ends in May 2026. ""The fake news is saying, 'Oh, if you fired him, it would be so bad, it would be so bad.' I don't know why it would be so bad, but I'm not going to fire him,"" the president said June 12. Mr. Trump has lashed out against the Fed for leaving interest rates steady so far this year after cutting rates last year. Further rate cuts could boost economic growth and make it easier for Americans to borrow money, but at the risk of causing inflation to spike. Interest rates remain near a two-decade high, after the Fed hiked rates in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has dropped significantly since then, but it remains above the Fed's 2%-per-year target, and Powell has indicated he plans to move cautiously. Powell has also said the Fed is concerned Mr. Trump's tariffs could cause inflation to worsen. Mr. Trump has argued inflation is already low enough to start cutting rates. He has criticized Powell in increasingly sharp terms, calling him a ""Total and Complete Moron"" and a ""numbskull"" in a Truth Social post last month. Powell was initially picked as Fed chair by Mr. Trump during his first administration, and former President Joe Biden nominated him for a second four-year term in 2022. A firing would immediately spark a legal challenge. The U.S. Supreme Court recently indicated they don't think Mr. Trump has the authority to do so. The justices in May ruled Mr. Trump can fire members of independent federal agencies including the National Labor Relations Board, but said its decision did not necessarily apply to the Federal Reserve because it is a ""uniquely structured, quasi-private entity.""

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reverse-mortgage-questions-seniors-should-be-asking-themselves-july-2025/,MoneyWatch,2025-07-22 15:10:24-04:00,4 reverse mortgage questions seniors should be asking themselves now,10,768,2025-07-29 17:15:41.336195,110,21,9,2,6,1,"By having the questions to select reverse mortgage questions now, seniors can better position themselves for long-term borrowing success. News last week that inflation rose in June , following a previous increase in May, was likely not the development millions of Americans were hoping for. In recent years, inflation has spiked the cost of numerous items, making it more difficult to make ends meet. This has been an even greater problem for seniors, many of whom are reliant upon limited funds to pay their bills. With Social Security and retirement funds finite, then, many of these seniors may be contemplating alternative funding sources right now. A reverse mortgage may be at the top of their list. With a reverse mortgage, homeowners age 62 and older can receive payments from their accumulated home equity . Either via a lump sum or monthly payments drawn from the home, funds here will only need to be repaid in the event of a sale of the home or if the homeowner dies. So it's naturally tempting to explore this unique funding source in the economic climate of 2025. Before getting started now, though, seniors would be well-served by preparing the answers to a series of important reverse mortgage questions. Below, we'll analyze four timely questions worth considering. Start by seeing how much you could get paid with a reverse mortgage here . 4 reverse mortgage questions seniors should be asking themselves now Here are four reverse mortgage questions seniors may want to start thinking about the answers to right now: Is it the smartest way to borrow home equity right now? There are myriad ways to borrow home equity now, ranging from reverse mortgages to home equity loans to home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) . Some homeowners may even benefit from a cash-out refinance . And with interest rates on home equity loans and HELOCs much lower than personal loans and credit cards, now may be the ideal time to borrow equity that way instead of using a reverse mortgage. Start, then, by exploring all of your potential home equity borrowing options to determine if a reverse mortgage is truly the smartest way to borrow your hard-earned equity now. Compare your current reverse mortgage options online to learn more . Can I adequately get by with Social Security and other funds? Concerns over recent Social Security overpayments, clawbacks and insolvency are all pertinent right now and it's understandable if homeowners feel like they need an additional funding source, of which a reverse mortgage can easily provide. But your home is likely your most prized financial asset and borrowing from it should always be done judiciously, especially now. So, ask yourself if you can adequately get by with Social Security and your other retirement funds instead. If you can't, a reverse mortgage makes sense. But if you're just looking for an alternative income stream that you don't truly need, it may not. What are my financial goals for my beneficiaries? If you were planning to pass your paid-off home to your beneficiaries after your death, then a reverse mortgage can alter those plans. Since funds here will need to be repaid once the homeowner has died, there may be little or nothing left to pass on to beneficiaries, many of whom may be depending on that money in today's inflationary and high-rate climate. Re-evaluate your financial goals for your beneficiaries, then, before pursuing your reverse mortgage options. You may find that there are ways to protect a portion of your assets for your beneficiaries while still securing a new income stream for yourself simultaneously. Which payment type makes the most sense? If you ultimately do settle on a reverse mortgage as your optimal recourse now, then you'll need to determine how you want to get paid. With a reverse mortgage, you can receive funds in a lump sum, via monthly payments and potentially even as a revolving credit line similar to a credit card or HELOC. Which payment strategy makes the most sense for your needs and goals? This question will be specific to the homeowner in question, but it's worth contemplating the answer now so you're better prepared when it comes time to complete the formal paperwork. The bottom line A reverse mortgage could be the precise financial tool seniors require in today's unpredictable but still difficult financial landscape. By taking the time to think through the answers to these four questions, these seniors can better determine if this is truly the right move for their financial situation now or if they're better served by exploring alternatives or, in some instances, keeping their current financial strategy the same."
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/young-people-trumps-job-handling-cbs-news-analysis/,MoneyWatch,2025-07-29 12:51:09-04:00,"Six months in, young people have soured on Trump's job handling — CBS News analysis",15,944,2025-07-29 17:15:41.453785,118,23,8,3,10,2,"03:57 Since Donald Trump took office for his second term, his job ratings have markedly declined — and more with young people than any other age group. What has made so many young Americans change their minds so quickly? For context, President Trump's electoral performance with voters under 30 improved a lot in 2024 : While he lost this group to former Vice President Kamala Harris, it was by a much smaller margin than in 2020. And men under 30 ended up splitting roughly evenly between Trump and Harris. These trends prompted some observers to marvel at how conservative Gen Z had become, especially young men, and to wonder whether it marked a durable change. About half a year on from Inauguration Day, many young people have changed their minds on Trump. It looks more like many young voters gave him the benefit of the doubt when he took office, but their evaluations of him quickly started to sink. Among Americans ages 18-29, his job approval rating has fallen from a high of 55% just after he was inaugurated to 28% now. That means that half of his former approvers now disapprove. In percentage-point terms, the size of that drop is more than double what we've seen in any other age group. Which young voters have dropped off? Among young people, it's the less partisan and politically engaged who have seen the steepest drops. For example, about half of independents under 30 approved of Mr. Trump in February, but that has dropped to about one in five now. The same is true of young people who didn't vote in the 2024 election. Party identifiers and '24 voters have fallen off, too, but not to the same extent. There are also differences by gender, with young men starting out more approving of Mr. Trump than young women were. Women's ratings of the president had already begun dipping by March , while it was not until April — and the downturn in the U.S. stock market — that young men's ratings started to decline. Both have fallen steadily since then, but a faster drop among young men in the last few months has meant the gender gap in approval of Mr. Trump has shrunk. (See the bottom of this article for statistical details on estimating these smaller subgroups.) over the past few months offers several clues as to what young people are unhappy about these days. A majority now say Mr. Trump is doing different things than he promised during the 2024 campaign. That's a reversal in sentiment from early February, when seven in 10 said he's doing what he said he would. And it's young men who have been the most likely to flip on this question. On top of that, the administration is experiencing low points on several economic evaluations: The share of young people saying the economy is getting worse has risen to six in 10. And young Americans are less likely than older ones to see the job market as good. Over time , young people have increasingly rated it as fairly or very bad. Six in 10 also tell us that Mr. Trump's policies are making them worse off financially. That is the highest we've seen to date, and it represents a complete change from what young people expected when he was inaugurated. Back then , they were much more likely to say his policies would make them better off than worse off. And majorities feel the Trump administration is focusing too much on tariffs (72%), deportations (64%), and ending DEI programs (55%). These shares have all grown significantly over time. By contrast, seven in 10 say the administration isn't focusing enough on lowering prices, which was a key campaign issue. Looking back and ahead… Instead of marking a permanent rightward shift, Mr. Trump's better-than-expected performance with young voters last year is beginning to look more like a temporary reaction. Indeed, less partisan voters tend to be more responsive to short-term forces, like the economic conditions that drove many at the ballot box in 2024. And when Trump was inaugurated, many young people hoped he would turn the economy around, with his initial ratings likely reflecting some optimism. This honeymoon period quickly faded . His 18-29 rating is now below Joe Biden's when he left office . Looking ahead to 2026, Republicans' electoral success may depend on both the president's numbers and youth turnout. If views of Mr. Trump's job handling don't improve over the next year, they could be a drag on GOP congressional candidates. And while young voters are less likely to turn out in non-presidential years, both the 2018 and 2022 midterms saw record numbers go to the polls, including voters under 30. In fact, in 2022, young voters turned out at a rate that came close to saving the Democrats' majority. In a tight contest, they could be pivotal again. Estimating small subgroups in polls In order to more precisely estimate trends in approval among young people, I aggregated our polls and ran a statistical model that controls for respondents' race, education level, 2024 vote, and survey date. Why take this approach? All polls have a margin of error, and the margin of error is greater for subgroups within the poll, as a function of sample size and routine weighting. So, even though young people are represented proportionate to their share of the population, estimating what percentage of them approve of the president naturally comes with a higher margin of error. It's driven by random variation in which types of young people respond to a given poll, and margins of error grow as you slice data more thinly — for instance, in disaggregating young people by gender. Since a single poll can only do so much, we can combine data across polls to boost sample sizes and gain confidence in our estimates. Aggregating surveys yields sample sizes of over 1,200 men and 1,300 women under 30 to analyze. And the model smoothens out poll-to-poll randomness within these subgroups. The modeled estimates for any given time point are consistently within range of the unmodeled survey data, typically within a few points. And importantly, they tell the same story: both young men and young women's views of Trump have worsened, and the gender gap has decreased. Economy Donald Trump"

The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there. ""Ten days from today. Okay?"" he said on the plane. ""And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,"" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could."" The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window , the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia. Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia. ""I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'"" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. ""And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything."" It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin ""wants peace."" On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12. ""There's no reason in waiting,"" Mr. Trump said Monday. ""We just don't see any progress being made."" Ukraine Ceasefire Politics Russia Trump Administration Vladimir Putin"

For example, research has shown eating more than one serving of red meat per week is associated with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes . A study from earlier this year also found processed red meats are linked to increased risk of diseases, including cancer and dementia. And yet, a survey from Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital last year found nearly a third of Americans could have undiagnosed iron deficiency, which can cause symptoms including fatigue, palpitations, headaches, brain fog and restless legs. So how can you get the recommended dietary allowance of iron — about 8 milligrams for adult males and 18 milligrams for adult females — per day? Best sources of iron other than red meat Connelly's suggestions for plant-based iron sources include: Lentils Beans Tofu Pumpkin seeds Spinach Certain seafoods are also great choices, she added, including: Oysters Clams Sardines Qianzhi Jiang, a registered dietitian and owner of The Nutrition Changer , said another important source of iron in the United States if fortified breads and cereals. According to the National Institutes of Health , about half of dietary iron comes from bread, cereal and other grain products in the U.S. Iron found in plant-based sources like nuts and beans, however, need to be transformed before our bodies can absorb it, Jiang explained, adding it's best to pair plant-based iron with vitamin C-rich foods to boost absorption. Still worried you're not getting enough iron? Supplements are another option to consider after consulting your doctor, experts said. ""Supplements should be viewed as supplemental sources of vitamins and minerals. We should prioritize meeting nutritional goals from natural food sources,"" Jiang said. ""This helps us get the most benefits of all sorts of nutrients while minimizing the risk of overconsumption."""

Neither of the AI models scored full marks — unlike five young people at the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), a prestigious annual competition where participants must be under 20 years old. Google said Monday that an advanced version of its Gemini chatbot had solved five out of the six math problems set at the IMO, held in Australia's Queensland this month. ""We can confirm that Google DeepMind has reached the much-desired milestone, earning 35 out of a possible 42 points - a gold medal score,"" the U.S. tech giant cited IMO president Gregor Dolinar as saying. ""Their solutions were astonishing in many respects. IMO graders found them to be clear, precise and most of them easy to follow."" Around 10% of human contestants won gold-level medals, and five received perfect scores of 42 points. U.S. ChatGPT maker OpenAI said its experimental reasoning model had also scored a gold-level 35 points on the test. The result ""achieved a longstanding grand challenge in AI"" at ""the world's most prestigious math competition,"" OpenAI researcher Alexander Wei said in a social media post. ""We evaluated our models on the 2025 IMO problems under the same rules as human contestants,"" he said. ""For each problem, three former IMO medalists independently graded the model's submitted proof."" Google achieved a silver-medal score at last year's IMO in the city of Bath, in southwest England, solving four of the six problems. That took two to three days of computation — far longer than this year, when its Gemini model solved the problems within the 4.5-hour time limit, it said. The IMO said tech companies had ""privately tested closed-source AI models on this year's problems,"" the same ones faced by 641 competing students from 112 countries. ""It is very exciting to see progress in the mathematical capabilities of AI models,"" said IMO president Dolinar. Contest organizers could not verify how much computing power had been used by the AI models or whether there had been human involvement, he noted. In an interview with CBS' 60 Minutes earlier this year, one of Google's leading AI researchers predicted that within just five to 10 years, computers would be made that have human-level cognitive abilities — a landmark known as ""artificial general intelligence."" Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis predicted that AI technology was on track to understand the world in nuanced ways, and to not only solve important problems, but even to develop a sense of imagination, within a decade, thanks to an increase in investment. ""It's moving incredibly fast,"" Hassabis said. ""I think we are on some kind of exponential curve of improvement. Of course, the success of the field in the last few years has attracted even more attention, more resources, more talent. So that's adding to the, to this exponential progress.""

Why some parents are opting for the training wheel-free option for kids,17,530,2025-07-29 17:15:42.399228,114,25,2,5,10,0,"Students and parents swap the bus for biking to school together 02:10 Getting training wheels taken off a bicycle is often regarded as a rite of passage for youngsters learning to ride a bike — but some kids are skipping the step altogether by using balance bikes. Balance bikes, some of which are designed for children as young as 10 months old, don't have training wheels or pedals. Instead, they reverse the whole bike learning process, said James Beechinor, president of bike brand Early Rider 's U.S. division. While bikes with training wheels teach kids to pedal, steer and brake, balance bikes focus on the balance aspect from the start. After the child better understands how to balance, they can start cruising, getting enough momentum to lift their feet up and coast. Research has backed up the earlier riding claims, too. A 2022 study — from researchers in The Netherlands and published in the British Journal of Developmental Psychology — found practicing on a balance bike is associated with an earlier age of independent cycling compared with practicing on a bike with training wheels. ""The advantage of the balance bicycle arises because they challenge children more to actively maintain balance,"" the authors wrote. Despite being introduced several decades ago, balance bikes make up only about 1% of the kids bike market in 2024, according to Beechinor — although they recently gained more traction. Now multiple brands, styles, age ranges and prices (starting around $50 and up) have hit shelves and online retailers. Despite a decline in the overall kids bike market, balance bike sales are up, Beechinor said. ""We're definitely seeing an increase. The kids bike market as a whole is down the last 12 months by about 6% but balance bike sales are up 3% so they're kind of bucking the trend with the kids market,"" he said. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mallory Mack (@mallorymack_) The benefits of the bikes go beyond learning how to ride earlier, he argues. They boost general well-being and overall development, he says. According to a 2022 study out of Portugal that was published in the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health, balance biking can have mental and physical benefits for young kids. ""Children who begun to cycle at an early age are more likely to have a healthy weight in the subsequent school years, they can have fun moments cycling outdoors with peers or family, they develop motor components, and mature their social and emotional skills,"" the authors wrote. The authors of both studies declared no conflict of interest."

""Let's go. 1-2-3,"" Mr. Trump said before he cut the red ribbon. Mr. Trump and his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., were also set to play the first-ever round at the new Trump course in the village of Balmedie, on the northern coast of Scotland. ""This has been an unbelievable development,"" the president said before the ceremonial opening. He thanked his son Eric for his work on the project, saying it was ""truly a labor of love for him."" The overseas jaunt enabled Mr. Trump to escape Washington's sweaty summer humidity and the still-raging scandal over the case of Jeffrey Epstein . President Trump watches his drive after playing from the first tee to officially open the Trump International Golf Links course in Balmedie, Aberdeenshire, in northern Scotland on July 29, 2025. It was mostly built around golf — and walking the new course before it officially begins offering rounds to the public on Aug. 13, adding to a lengthy list of ways the president has used the White House to promote his brand. Billing itself the ""Greatest 36 Holes in Golf,"" the Trump International Golf Links, Scotland, was designed by Eric Trump. The course is hosting a PGA Seniors Championship event later this week, after Mr. Trump leaves. Signs promoting the event had already been erected all over the course before he arrived on Tuesday and, on the highway leading in, temporary metal signs guided drivers onto the correct road. Golfers hitting the course at dawn as part of that event had to put their clubs through metal detectors erected as part of the security sweeps ahead of his arrival. Several dozen people, some dressed for golf, including wearing cleats, had filled the sand trap near the tee box to watch the ribbon-cutting ceremony shortly before it was scheduled to start. Another group of people was watching from the other side in tall grass growing on sand dunes flanking the first hole. Also from Scotland's north is the president's late mother, Mary Anne MacLeod, who was born on the Isle of Lewis, immigrated to New York and died in 2000 at age 88. ""My mother loved Scotland,"" Mr. Trump said during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday at another one of his golf courses, Turnberry, on Scotland's southern coast. ""It's different when your mother was born here."" Mr. Trump used his trip to meet with Starmer and reach a trade framework for tariffs between the U.S. and the European Union's 27 member countries — though scores of key details remain to be hammered out. But the trip has featured a lot of golf, and having the president visit is sure to raise the new course's profile. Mr. Trump's assets are in a trust, and his sons are running the family business while he's in the White House. Any business generated at the course will ultimately enrich the president when he leaves office though. A press release says the new course features the world's largest natural bunker, dunes and greens overlooking the sea, with a ""focus on environmental sensitivity."" Visible from various parts of the new course were towering windmills lining the coast — some with blades that showed visible dots of rust. They are part of a nearby windfarm that Mr. Trump sued to block construction of in 2013. He lost that case and was eventually ordered to pay legal costs for bringing it — and the issue still enrages him. During the meeting with Starmer, Mr. Trump called windmills ""ugly monsters"" and suggested they were part of ""the most expensive form of energy."" ""I restricted windmills in the United States because they also kill all your birds,"" the president said. ""If you shoot a bald eagle in the United States, they put you in jail for five years. And windmills knock out hundreds of them. They don't do anything. Explain that."" Starmer said in the U.K., ""we believe in a mix"" of energy, including oil and gas and renewables. The new golf course is the third owned by the Trump Organization in Scotland. Mr. Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 and owns another course near Aberdeen that opened in 2012. Mr. Trump golfed at Turnberry on Saturday, as protesters took to the streets, and on Sunday. He invited Starmer, who famously doesn't golf, aboard Air Force One so the prime minister could get a private tour of his Aberdeen properties before Tuesday's ceremonial opening. ""Even if you play badly, it's still good,"" Mr. Trump said of golfing on his course over the weekend. ""If you had a bad day on the golf course, it's OK. It's better than other days."" Mr. Trump also found time to to praise Turnberry's renovated ballroom, which he said he'd paid lavishly to upgrade — even suggesting that he might install one like it at the White House. ""I could take this one, drop it right down there,"" Mr. Trump joked. ""And it would be beautiful."" Donald Trump Scotland"

The president, who said in Scotland on Monday that he was shortening his original 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace with Ukraine, spoke to reporters about the revised deadline Tuesday aboard Air Force One as he returned to the U.S. Mr. Trump has been in Scotland for the last five days to negotiate trade deals with European leaders and visit his two golf resorts there. ""Ten days from today. Okay?"" he said on the plane. ""And then you know, we're going to put on tariffs and stuff, and I don't know if it's going to affect Russia, because he wants to obviously probably keep the war going,"" the president added, seemingly speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""But we're going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on. It may or may not affect them, but it could."" The U.S. and Ukraine have been pushing for an immediate ceasefire in order to negotiate a lasting peace deal. Earlier in July, Mr. Trump said if Russia doesn't agree to a ceasefire within a 50-day window , the U.S. would impose secondary tariffs of up to 100% on goods sold by countries that do business with Russia. Mr. Trump has increasingly expressed frustration with Putin, questioning whether the Russian leader really wants to end the war with Ukraine. Mr. Trump has described thinking he'd had a good phone call with the Russian leader, only to find that the next day, more Ukrainians were being killed by Russia. ""I always hang up, [and] say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,'"" Mr. Trump said earlier in July. ""And then missiles are launched into Kyiv or some other city, and I say, 'That's strange.' And after that happens three or four times, you say, the talk doesn't mean anything."" It's a change from earlier this year, when Mr. Trump said he thought Putin ""wants peace."" On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was ""very disappointed"" in Putin over Moscow's continued bombing of Ukraine, narrowing Russia's timeframe for a deal from 50 days to 10 or 12.

""It is an asymmetric and unbalanced deal,"" economists with investment bank Société Générale said in a report. The EU decided neither to retaliate nor to increase its tariffs, and is even expected to reduce them. The EU agreed to a bad deal rather than risk trade war escalation."" The average tariff on U.S. imports from the EU will surge from 1.2% in 2024 to 17.5%, according to investor advisory firm Capital Economics. That will reduce the EU's annual gross domestic product by 0.2%, the investment advisory firm forecast. EU countries annually ship more than $300 billion in goods to the U.S., accounting for more than 20% of total U.S. imports. Mexico ranks second among America's trade partners at roughly 15% of U.S. imports, while Canada accounts for 11% (see chart at bottom.) The deal, announced Sunday by President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, while American goods exported to the union's 27 member countries will face no tariffs. Previously, U.S. exports to the EU faced an average tariff of roughly 1%, according to Goldman Sachs analysts. The EU also pledged to buy $750 billion worth of energy from the U.S., up from about $80 billion a year, and to invest $600 billion by 2028. The trade agreement will boost Americans by increasing access to the EU's vast market and supporting the U.S. manufacturing sector, according to the Trump administration. ""This colossal deal will enable U.S. farmers, ranchers, fishermen and manufacturers to increase U.S. exports, expand business opportunities and help reduce the goods trade deficit with the European Union,"" the White House said Monday in a fact sheet about the pact. The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment. Reducing uncertainty Although the agreement sharply raises U.S. tariffs, economists said the deal will also help ease some of the uncertainty around trade relations with a key trading partner. Perhaps most important, it is better than the alternative given that Mr. Trump had threatened to slap a 30% tariff on EU imports . More broadly, the EU deal and the Trump administration's framework agreement with Japan last week — both of which set 15% as a baseline tariff — also could help pave the way for trade agreements with Canada, Korea, Mexico and other countries, including on key sectors like autos, experts said. ""[C]ompared to expectations we had a few weeks before, in particular when pharmaceuticals and semiconductors could have been subject to higher tariffs, it looks like this deal is better than feared,"" Michel Martinez, head Europe economist at Société Générale, told CBS MoneyWatch. European auto exports would face a 15% levy, down from 25%, according to Goldman Sachs. Von der Leyen also said the U.S. would eliminate tariffs on some products, including aircraft and parts, semiconductor manufacturing gear, natural resources, some farm products, and certain chemicals and generic drugs. Likewise, the EU would abolish tariffs on those products. Neither the U.S. nor the EU has released details of the pact, and lobbying by some industries is expected to continue. For example, Unione Italiana Vini, an Italian trade group representing winemakers, said in a statement on Monday that a 15% tariff on EU imports will result in a a $371 million hit for exporters. ""We are now calling on the Italian government and the EU to consider appropriate measures to safeguard a sector that has grown significantly thanks to U.S. buyers,"" the group's president, Lamberto Frescobaldi, said in a statement, while acknowledging that the deal ""at least resolved the uncertainty that was stalling the market."" According to the group's analysis, a bottle of Italian wine that previously retailed for $11.50 in the U.S. will now cost nearly $15 under the new tariff agreement. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA), which represents German automakers, also said a 15% U.S. tariff on the country's automotive products will hurt its car manufacturers, while noting that the new tariff rate amounts to a reprieve from the 25% automobile levies EU nations have faced since April. Wayne Winegarden, an economist at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank that support free market policies, expects the U.S.-EU deal is to raise prices for consumers and lower corporate profits. ""Going forward, we are going to start to see these impacts either through lower profitability for corporations and higher costs for consumers, and most likely a combination of the two,"" he told CBS MoneyWatch. Despite the Trump administration's recent trade deals with the EU, Japan, U.K. and several other Asian countries, the U.S. still faces a self-imposed Aug. 1 deadline to reach agreements with Canada, Mexico, Korean other key trading partners.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jeffrey-epstein-jail-video-investigation/,World,2025-07-29 15:25:00-04:00,CBS News investigation of Jeffrey Epstein jail video reveals new discrepancies,11,2707,2025-07-29 17:15:42.865367,118,25,8,5,16,6,"Forensics expert analysis of Jeffrey Epstein jail video contradicts government's claims 09:46 In the weeks after Jeffrey Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in lower Manhattan, in August 2019, then-Attorney General William Barr said his ""personal review"" of surveillance footage clearly showed that no one entered the area where Epstein was housed, leading him to agree with the conclusion of the medical examiner that Epstein had died by suicide . It's a claim that's been repeated by other top federal officials, including FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, who said on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends"" in May, ""There's video clear as day — he's the only person in there and the only person coming out."" The review doesn't refute the conclusion that Epstein died by suicide. But it raises questions about the strength and credibility of the government's investigation, which appears to have drawn conclusions from the video that are not readily observable. The Epstein jail video The silent surveillance video, which runs for nearly 11 hours, provides a narrow window into Epstein's world during his last hours on earth. Staffers on duty that night in the Metropolitan Correctional Center carry blankets, fill out paperwork and occasionally appear to doze off. The grainy, pixelated footage shows two doors, a nondescript blue trash can and a stair landing. Beyond the banister, a third of the frame is filled with a bright, fluorescent-lit open area. A staircase is visible on the left, and in the back, a dark, blurry patch marks the correctional officer's desk. To the right of the desk is the faint outline of part of the staircase leading up to Epstein's cell. Video released by the Justice Department and FBI shows a view of the Special Housing Unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center on Aug. 9, 2019. Officials say Jeffrey Epstein can be seen at the left, partly obscured, walking towards the staircase that leads to his cell. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Several cameras in the Special Housing Unit were functioning but unmonitored, the report said, and the government has stated that a failure of the digital video recording system resulted in the loss of most of the footage from the night of Aug. 9-10, 2019, that would have provided a fuller view. The video that was released begins at 7:40 p.m. Nine minutes later, according to the report of the Justice Department inspector general, Epstein appears for the first and last time on camera. He emerges from the left side of the screen and walks down a stairwell accompanied by a corrections officer. Employees told investigators that Epstein had just finished an unmonitored call, later reported to have been with his girlfriend in Belarus. The video rolls, almost uninterrupted, for the next 11 hours. At 6:30 a.m., corrections officers can be seen rushing across the frame. The Justice Department later disclosed that that's when Epstein's body was discovered. Over the course of the night, the staff on duty failed to conduct the required 30-minute check-ins on Epstein while he spent the night alone in his cell. Prison officials had already determined that he was a suicide risk — he had allegedly tried to kill himself weeks earlier, in mid-July. Because of this, under prison protocol, he was assigned a roommate. But that roommate had been transferred earlier in the day and prison staff had not assigned him a new one. Two staff members, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were ultimately charged with falsifying records, but the charges were later dropped. There were no supervisors or Bureau of Prisons officials punished for these alleged oversights that preceded the death of the highest-profile prisoner in the facility — perhaps in the entire federal prison system. Last month, the FBI announced the Epstein case was closed , based partly on the video evidence, and reiterated that Epstein had killed himself in his cell as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges. The FBI claimed ""anyone entering or attempting to enter the tier where Epstein's cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by this footage."" The video, cross-referenced with diagrams of the Epstein holding area, does not appear to support that finding. That becomes obvious in the first 10 minutes of the video. Epstein's cell was in the L Block, accessible via a staircase from the Special Housing Unit's common area. When Epstein appears on camera, he is seen walking toward the stairs leading to his cell, but since the staircase is almost entirely out of view from the camera, he is never seen ascending. The entrance to Epstein's cell, as well as the primary entrance to the SHU, are off camera in the same direction, meaning there's no way to tell from the video if he went to his cell or exited the SHU. This illustration shows the location of Jeffrey Epstein's cell, in red. The common area of the Special Housing Unit is at the center. While brief movement is occasionally visible on the stairs when someone is walking up the left side, the area remains mostly obscured throughout the recording, making it impossible to determine if someone may have entered the SHU through the primary entrance and accessed the staircase without ever being captured on the recording. This illustration shows a path from the entrance to the Special Housing Unit common area to the stairs leading up to Epstein's cell. Only a narrow portion of the staircase could be seen in video released by federal officials. This appears to directly contradict the FBI and the inspector general's assertion and allows for the possibility of unrecorded movement between those areas. Without visual evidence, the case relies on the word of staff members Noel and Thomas that no one entered. At one point the Justice Department noted both of them appeared to have fallen asleep, although Noel denies this. Experts question investigators' interpretation of orange shape moving up the stairs. Just before 10:40 p.m., an orange shape is seen moving up the stairs leading to Epstein's tier. The report says. ""Through review and analysis of the SHU video footage, witness statements, and BOP records, the OIG determined that at approximately 10:40 p.m. a CO [corrections officer], believed to be Noel, carried linen or inmate clothing up to the L Tier, which was the last time any CO approached the only entrance to the SHU tier in which Epstein was housed."" U.S. Bureau of Prisons A cursor and a menu appear on screen and the video is sped up. A cursor can be seen on the image of the garbage can in this closeup. U.S. Bureau of Prisons Stafford, who looked at the video using specialized software to extract the underlying coding, known as metadata, said the metadata showed that the file was first created on May 23 of this year and that it was likely a ""screen capture, not an actual export"" of the raw file. In addition, the analysts said, a shift in the frame aspect ratio (that is, the ratio of the width to the height of an image) indicated that it was two clips edited together, not a continuous run of footage. The ""missing minute."" The time counter burned into the video moves without interruption until shortly before midnight. Then the time leaps forward by one minute without explanation. When the feed returns at 12 a.m., the video's aspect ratio changes slightly, a barely perceptible shift in view that experts said is another indication that the footage was edited or reprocessed and is not raw. During this minute, an unnamed staffer with the title Materials Handler — on duty from 4 p.m. to midnight — would have finished his shift and, and is assumed to have left the unit. While there is nothing to suggest this action has any relevance to the events of that evening, the missing stretch of time raises questions about the value of the video to conclusively determine what occurred. There is no mention of a missing minute in the inspector general's report. ""There was a minute that was off that counter, and what we learned from Bureau of Prisons was every year, every night, they redo that video,"" Bondi said July 8, noting that the system was old. ""Every night is reset, so every night should have that same missing minute. So we're looking for that video as well, to show it's missing every night."" At 12:05:48 a.m., an unidentified individual passes through the SHU. The inspector general's report says only two staff members entered the unit after midnight: one is a corrections officer, identified only as ""CO3,"" and the other is described as the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The presence of a third unidentified individual seen on the video is not addressed by the inspector general's report. In one instance, the inspector general's report appears to conflate the actions of Tova Noel with another female staff member. The report says Noel stated she left Epstein alone in the shower area, where he had made his unmonitored phone call. She told officials she left the area to use the restroom in an adjoining area, and when she returned, Epstein had already been escorted to his cell by someone else. But the video shows what appears to be Noel remaining in the unit and personally escorting Epstein to the staircase leading to his cell. There is another female staffer present, who is seen on camera exiting the unit just before Epstein is escorted. She returns shortly afterward. This discrepancy occurs during a crucial time period. Epstein had been allowed to make an unmonitored call from a shower area using a phone line intended only for attorney communications. According to the report, this was facilitated by the unit manager, who was the senior officer in charge. Epstein allegedly said he wanted to call his mother — even though his mother died in 2003. The unit manager dialed a 646 number (a New York City area code), a man answered, and he handed the phone to Epstein. The unit manager then left the area but later called and asked Noel to retrieve the phone. The Bureau of Prisons' Northeast regional director later told investigators that the unmonitored call was extremely concerning, stating: ""We don't know what happened on that phone. It could have potentially led to the incident [Epstein's death], but we don't — we will never know."" Multiple staff members are seen entering the Epstein unit while Noel and Thomas remain visible in the common area. In assessing the video, Justice Department officials have said no one could have entered Epstein's tier without being seen because (1) the staircase was visible on the tape, and (2) access to the SHU was only possible by passing through two locked doors, which are both off camera. One door is remotely operated and one requires a physical key, which Noel told investigators only she and Thomas possessed. However, the video shows several individuals entering and exiting while Thomas and Noel are seen nowhere near the door, or not present at all, contradicting her statement. As a result, there is no way to know from the video if it indeed was possible for someone to enter the unit and climb the stairs to Epstein's cell without being seen. Were there other cameras recording? In addition to the cameras that failed to record other angles of the SHU common area, the inspector general's report states there were two additional cameras recording events in the vicinity of the Epstein unit — one covering an elevator bank used to transport inmates and another focused on a nearby guard desk. Neither of those videos has been released, but a screen grab from one was included in the report . This image from the Justice Department inspector general's report shows the view of an elevator bank from another camera at the jail where Epstein was held. The video from this camera was not released. U.S. Department of Justice ""The OIG appreciates the careful review of our report. Our comprehensive assessment of the circumstances over the weeks, days, and hours before Epstein's death included the effects of the longstanding, chronic staffing crisis in the BOP and the BOP's failure to provide and maintain quality camera coverage within its facilities. As CBS notes, nothing in its analysis changed or modified the OIG's conclusions or recommendations."" Federal Bureau of Investigation United States Department of Justice Jeffrey Epstein"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/union-pacific-norfolk-southern-merger-transcontinental-railroad/,Health,2025-07-29 11:40:12-04:00,Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern propose merger to create nation's first transcontinental railroad,13,1095,2025-07-29 17:15:42.952073,103,21,0,2,9,0,"Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern merger worth $85 billion could create 1st transcontinental railroad 00:25 Union Pacific wants to buy Norfolk Southern in a $85 billion deal that would create the first transcontinental railroad in the U.S, and potentially trigger a final wave of rail mergers across the country. The proposed merger, announced Tuesday, would marry Union Pacific's vast rail network in the West with Norfolk's rails that snake across 22 Eastern states, and the District of Columbia. The nation was first linked by rail in 1869, when a golden railroad spike was driven in Utah to symbolize the connection of East and West Coasts. Yet no single entity has controlled that coast-to-coast passage. The railroads argue a merger would streamline deliveries of raw materials and goods nationwide by eliminating delays when shipments are handed off between railroads. The AP first reported the merger talks earlier this month a week before the railroads confirmed the discussions last week. Any deal would be closely scrutinized by antitrust regulators that have set a very high bar for railroad deals after previous consolidation in the industry led to massive backups and snarled traffic. Pressure on remaining railroads If the deal is approved, the two remaining major American railroads — BNSF and CSX — will face tremendous pressure to merge to create a second transcontinental railroad so they can compete. The continent's two other major railroads — Canadian National and CPKC — may also get involved. The Canadian rails span all of that nation and feed into America. CPKC rails stretch south into Mexico Some big shippers like chemical plants in the Gulf may be wary of the deal due to fears of a monopoly that could would wield immense influence over rates, but other major rail customers, like Amazon and UPS, may be in favor if it means packages will arrive more quickly and reliably. Those big companies, along with unions and communities across the country that the railroads cross, will have a chance to weigh before the U.S. Surface Transportation Board. Consumers could benefit if the transcontinental rail does reduce shipping rates and delivery times. Union Pacific said that combined, the railroads would improve delivery times. There's speculation that this deal might win approval under the pro-business Trump administration, but the STB is currently evenly split between two Republicans and two Democrats. The board is led by a Republican, and Trump will appoint a fifth member before this deal will be considered. Union Pacific is offering $20 billion cash and one share of its stock to complete the deal. Norfolk Southern shareholders would receive one UP share and $88.82 in cash for each one of their shares as part of the deal that values NS at roughly $320 per share. Norfolk Southern closed at just over $260 a share earlier this month before the first reports speculating about a deal. Union Pacific's stock fell nearly 2% to $224.98 in premarket trading, while Norfolk Southern's stock dipped more than 3% to $277.40. Union Pacific CEO Jim Vena, who has championed a merger, said lumber from the Pacific Northwest and plastics produced on the Gulf Coast and steel made in Pittsburgh will all reach their destinations more seamlessly. ""It builds upon President Abraham Lincoln's vision of a transcontinental railroad from nearly 165 years ago, and will usher in a new era of American innovation,"" Vena told investors Tuesday. From 30 to 6 U.S. railroads have already undergone extensive consolidation. There were more than 30 major freight railroads in the early 1980s. Today, six major railroads handle the majority of shipments nationwide. Western rival BNSF, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, has the war chest to pursue an acquisition of CSX, to the east, if it chooses. CEO Warren Buffett is sitting on more than $348 billion cash and the consummate dealmaker may want to swing for the fences one last time before stepping down as planned at the end of the year. Buffett recently threw cold water on reports that he had enlisted Goldman Sachs to advise him on a potential rail deal in an interview with CNBC , but he rarely uses investment bankers anyway. Buffett reached an agreement to buy the parts of the BNSF railroad he didn't already own for $26.3 billion after a private meeting with its CEO more than a decade ago. Yet there's widespread debate over whether a major rail merger would be approved by the Surface Transportation Board, which has established a high bar for consolidation in the crucial rail industry. That's largely due to the aftermath of a consolidation in the U.S nearly 30 years ago that involved Union Pacific. It merged with Southern Pacific in 1996 and the tie-up led to an extended period of snarled traffic on U.S. rails. Three years later, Conrail was divvied up by Norfolk Southern and CSX, which led to more backups in the East. ""We're committed to making sure that doesn't happen in this case,"" said Norfolk CEO Mark George. He added that the railroads will spend the next two years planning for a smooth integration before this deal might get approved. Just two years ago, the STB approved the first major rail merger in more than two decades. In that deal, which was supported by big shippers, Canadian Pacific acquired Kansas City Southern for $31 billion to create the CPKC railroad. There were compelling factors in that deal, however, that combined the two smallest major freight railroads. The combined railroad, regulators reasoned, would benefit trade across North America. The deal announced Tuesday would merge the nation's largest freight railroad, with the smallest. Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern said they expect to submit their application for approval within the next six months and hope the deal would get approved by early 2027. They predict that they would be able to eliminate $1 billion in costs annually, but Vena said that every union worker at both railroads should still have a job. The railroads also predict they would be able to boost revenue by at least $1.75 billion each year by winning more business from trucking companies and other railroads. On Tuesday, Norfolk Southern reported a $768 million second-quarter profit, or $3.41 per share, as volume grew 3%. That's up from $737 million, or $3.25 per share, a year ago, but the results were affected by insurance payments from its 2023 East Palestine derailment and restructuring costs. Without the one-time factors, Norfolk Southern made $3.29 per share, which was just below the $3.31 per share that analysts surveyed by FactSet Research predicted.

While stretching can benefit physical well-being by keeping muscles flexible and healthy, it can also support mental health , according to research. Studies have also shown stretching can help patients dealing with chronic insomnia . ""The mind is racing around, the body is tired, but the two things don't seem to be able to communicate well enough with each other to just chill out and sleep,"" he said. ""So any movement that you do that can help with that embodiment — to be more in your body is a really important piece of relaxation. Getting that harmony between your mental state and your physical self."" So if you're someone who lays in bed exhausted but can't quite cross over into sleep, ""getting the body and mind on the same page before laying down can be really effective,"" he said. Stretching before bed also offers a time to check in with how we feel, Pasle-Green added, something we might not get the opportunity to do throughout our day. 6 stretching exercises to help you fall asleep 1. Forward fold: Whether standing with wide legs or sitting with your legs out in front of you, fold forward at your hips, creating a stretch. ""Oftentimes, any pose that incorporates or stretch that incorporates folding forwards can be really soothing for the system,"" Kelleher said, adding the physical sensation you feel during the stretch can give your mind something to focus on. ""We're not kind of worried about emails or what's coming next, or whatever the next steps in the evening routine are. We're just having an experience,"" he said, adding to incorporate a few deep breaths in this posture. 2. Seated ankle cross: While sitting on a bed, chair or couch, place one ankle on the opposite leg, as high as available, Pasle-Green explains, then lean forward with a long spine to move the chest as close to the top leg as is comfortable. Hold for three deep breaths then switch legs and repeat as desired, she said. Side view of a senior woman sitting relaxed in yoga exercise to stretch the back 3. Chest opener: Sit tall and place your hands behind you on the bed or couch, fingers pointing away from you. ""Let your head relax back, opening your chest and front of your neck,"" Pasle-Green said. ""To increase the stretch, you can finger-walk your hands further back or roll your head slightly side to side."" Hold this for three deep breaths. 4. Side stretch: While seated, place your right hand to your right and slide it away from you as you lean to the right, opening up your left side. You can also reach your left arm over your head and reaching it toward the right, Pasle-Green said. ""Breathe deeply throughout this stretch, keeping your body and your breath moving the whole time,"" she said, adding to repeat on each side. Side stretching on the floor. 5. Hug stretch: While seated, wrap your arms around your rib cage in a big hug with each hand on the opposite side shoulder blade. ""Take a big breath in, and as you exhale, drop your chin toward your chest and round your spine forward as far as you can, pressing your bottom elbow toward your belly button,"" Pasle-Green said, adding to repeat while switching which arm is on top. 6. Twist pose: While laying on your back, hug your knees into your chest. ""Then drop both knees off to one side while you open up your arms nice and wide right and create some lateral flexion in the spine and a feeling of twist,"" Kelleher said. From this position, drop both knees off to one side while you opening your arms for a gentle spine twist. PhotoAlto/Frederic Cirou While any of these stretches can offer benefits throughout the day, Pasle-Green said they are most effective during the transition from activity to rest. ""By intentionally relaxing the body and mind right before sleep, our most impactful span of rest, we get a greater return on the time invested by greatly enhancing the quality of that rest,"" she said. Before any of these stretches, Kelleher adds, it's important to put your phone away in order to prepare yourself to wind down. ""Give yourself a break from the onslaught of information,"" he said.

Police identified him as Shane D. Tamura, 27, of Las Vegas. New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said surveillance video shows the suspect leaving a double-parked black BMW alone and entering the building on Park Avenue with an M4 rifle in his right hand. He immediately opened fire at NYPD officer Didarul Islam, killing him. The gunman then shot a woman who'd taken shelter behind a pillar, then moved through the lobby, peppering it with gunfire, officials said. He then shot a security guard who'd taken cover behind a security desk. Another man who was wounded told police at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital he was shot in the lobby, Tisch said. The police commissioner said at one point the gunman was waiting for an elevator to arrive and when it did, a woman came out but he let her walk by unharmed. The gunman then took the elevator to the 33rd floor offices of Rudin Management and ""began walking the floor, firing rounds as he traveled,"" Tisch said, killing one person before walking down the hallway and shooting himself in the chest. NYPD officers stand in line during the dignified transfer of Didarul Islam, who was shot and killed by a gunman Monday evening, out of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Hospital to the medical examiner's office, early on July 29, 2025, in New York. Angelina Katsanis / AP One man who works in the building told he ""heard all these loud bangs, had no idea what it was ... I turn around all these people are running. ... I came out five minutes later (and) one of my co-workers came out and he said he saw two people get shot, and five minutes after that another one of our co-workers came out and said he saw two police officers trying to go up to the elevator banks that go to the higher floors."" A woman who also works in the area told the station, ""We rushed the window in the direction where the helicopters are going, and then, we look and there's cop cars everywhere, and then someone pulls up Twitter and we find out that there is an active shooter."" The building houses the headquarters of the NFL and Blackstone, one of the world's largest investment firms, and has numerous other well-known tenants. New York City Mayor Eric Adams said the gunman appeared to have been targeting the NFL offices. ""He did have a note on him. The note alluded to that he felt he had CTE, a known brain injury for those who participate in contact sports. He appeared to have blamed the NFL for his injury,"" Adams said on ""CBS Mornings"" Tuesday. A perimeter was blocked off around the building for blocks in every direction. NYPD officers and caution tape warned passersby away. Helicopters passed overhead for hours. People were told to shelter in place in buildings in the vicitniity. A number of tourists kept asking what had happened as they walked by and darted off with looks of concern when they learned there'd been a shooting. Two Blackstone employees in white-collared shirts and dress pants stood on a corner making calls and seemed relieved when they were told not to come in to work Tuesday. A young man who moved to New York only two weeks ago to work for Bank of America came to check out the scene. At an building nearby, people were ordering in late takeout food and gathering in the lobby. They told of colleagues who'd stepped out to get food as it was happening, not realizing what was going on down the block. Even hours after the shooting, one young woman seemed unsure if it was safe to leave. New York State Police troopers gather on 52nd Street outside a Manhattan office building where two people were shot, including a New York police officer, on July 28, 2025, in New York. Angelina Katsanis / AP Late into the night, the streets were ablaze with flashing lights from police and FDNY vehicles lining the scene's perimeter. Local TV footage showed lines of people evacuating the office building where the shootings took place with their hands above their heads in the hours after the killings, according to The Associated Press. Nekeisha Lewis was eating dinner with friends on the nearby plaza when she heard gunfire. ""It felt like it was a quick two shots and then it was rapid fire,"" she told the AP. Windows shattered and a man ran from the building saying, ""Help, help. I'm shot."" Lewis said. Kyle Marshall, 38, was working at a nearby Morgan Stanley office when his mother texted him about an active-shooter incident, asking if he was OK, Reuters reports. ""Then she texted me the address, and I was, like, 'Oh my God. That's right next door to my building,'"" he said. Marshall lives in the San Francisco area but comes to New York monthly for work. ""It doesn't make me feel less safe to be in Manhattan,"" he said. ""The police responded quickly."" Shooting Mass Shooting New York City"
CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-revoke-endangerment-finding-regulating-greenhouse-gases/,World,2025-07-29 15:31:54-04:00,"EPA to revoke ""endangerment finding,"" landmark basis for regulating greenhouse gases",11,1228,2025-07-29 17:15:43.273723,118,32,3,12,10,0,"Details on Trump EPA proposal to roll back Biden-era pollution limits 03:51 The Environmental Protection Agency has decided to revoke a key scientific finding it published 16 years ago that six greenhouse gases are a threat to public health and must be regulated under the Clean Air Act. Known as the "" endangerment finding ,"" it is the 2009 scientific basis for which the EPA has regulated greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles, as well as other sources of climate pollution, but Administrator Lee Zeldin announced on a conservative podcast Tuesday that the agency is revoking the finding, calling it, ""the largest deregulatory action in the history of America."" Since it was signed by then-Administrator Lisa Jackson in 2009, the finding has been used by the EPA to regulate sources of climate change-causing pollution from cars, power plants and other sources of transportation like planes, as well as oil and gas operations. But Tuesday, the EPA issued a press release saying if the draft to revoke the finding is finalized, it would ""repeal all resulting greenhouse gas emissions regulations for motor vehicles and engines, thereby reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family while decreasing the cost of living on all products that trucks deliver."" During his appearance on the ""Ruthless Podcast,"" Zeldin criticized the endangerment finding, saying it put too many regulatory restrictions on transportation and stationary sources of greenhouse gas pollution. ""There are people, who in the name of climate change, are willing to bankrupt the country,"" he said. Zeldin also said regulating climate pollution costs Americans too much money. If the proposed finding is finalized, it ""is expected to save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards,"" according to the EPA press release. But the EPA's own regulatory impact report says limiting emissions for cars and trucks is expected to generate more than $2.1 trillion in net benefits over the next 30 years, including $820 billion in fuel savings and $1.8 trillion in public health and climate benefits. Repealing the finding comes at a time when climate change impacts appear to be reaching new heights as 2024 was the hottest year on record, and natural disasters are growing more intense, destructive and deadly. Since 2010, there have been 246 billion-dollar disasters striking every U.S. state, causing more than $1.7 trillion in damages, and killing more than 7,700 people, according to archived data from NOAA . ""For the EPA to repeal the 2009 finding borders on criminal negligence,"" said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University, in a statement. ""The science was clear in 2009 and has become much stronger and clearer since: climate disruption is a large and growing problem; it is caused primarily from our use of fossil fuels and the resultant emissions of carbon dioxide and methane; and it is a deadly problem."" Legality of the endangerment finding In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that greenhouse gases are a form of air pollution that can be regulated under the Clean Air Act, but it tasked the EPA with making a scientific finding about whether the gases harm public health. Two years later, the EPA published the endangerment finding, relying on extensive scientific evidence and public input to definitively state that greenhouse gases, which cause climate change, threaten health and the welfare of current and future generations. ""I think it's the most impactful thing I worked on in my career,"" said a former EPA employee who was a key author on the 2009 endangerment finding and requested anonymity because of current contractual obligations with the federal government. The EPA's new proposal aims to question the agency's ability to set standards for car emissions, according to the press release. The full draft of the rule is not yet accessible on the EPA website or federal register to review. The release also said the EPA will ""update scientific data and challenge the assumptions"" of the 2009 finding with an upcoming study from the Department of Energy's 2025 Climate Work Group, which is not yet available. Plenty of conservative groups and attorneys general have tested the legality of the finding and were pleased with Tuesday's announcement. ""Over the last four years, conservative state attorneys general were the last line of defense in fighting back against the Biden administration's federal overreach and green new scam agenda,"" said Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita in a statement. The finding has previously been challenged in court, most recently in 2023 , but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit upheld the finding and the Supreme Court refused to hear the case. The EPA highlighted subsequent Supreme Court rulings since the finding was signed in 2009 and said, in its press release, those cases ""have significantly clarified the scope of EPA's authority under the CAA,"" indicating the agency may be open to testing whether today's court has an appetite to revisit and overturn the 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases should be regulated under the Clean Air Act by the EPA. ""The administration's move to jettison these standards flies in the face of the Supreme Court's landmark decision directing the EPA to follow the science,"" said Christy Goldfuss, executive director of the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a statement. ""If EPA finalizes this illegal and cynical approach, we will see them in court."" Impacts of the endangerment finding Since it was signed in 2009, the most crucial impacts of regulating greenhouse gasses have been to the U.S. transportation sector, which if it were its own country, would be the fourth largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, according to the European Commission and data from the EPA . New passenger vehicles today emit 24% less climate pollution than they did in 2011, the year before the first tailpipe regulations went into effect, according to the EPA's own estimates . The EPA tightened the tailpipe emissions standards for cars and trucks in 2024, which was expected to cut 7.2 billion tons of climate pollution by 2055 and save $13 billion in annual health benefits. But according to the EPA's press release, if the proposed draft is finalized it will, ""undo the underpinning of $1 trillion in costly regulations (and) save more than $54 billion annually,"" although no regulatory analysis has been provided to confirm those numbers. In addition to removing regulations on cars, the EPA has already jettisoned similar rules to limit emissions for power plants , has encouraged the development of fossil fuel-based energy and has promised to rollback dozens of additional environmental regulations that hamper the development of American energy and manufacturing. ""Trump's EPA is trying every trick in the book to deny and avoid their mission to protect people and the environment from the ravages of unchecked climate pollution. Instead of doing their job, this EPA is putting the safety of our loved ones at risk while ratcheting up grid instability, energy bills, and disaster costs,"" said former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, in a statement.

CBS News,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/reverse-mortgage-dos-and-donts-seniors-should-know-now/,MoneyWatch,2025-07-29 15:16:41-04:00,Reverse mortgage dos and dont's seniors should know now,9,734,2025-07-29 17:15:43.511180,112,21,10,2,6,1,"Seniors should carefully evaluate their reverse mortgage options before formally applying in today's economy. While the stock market is doing well and there are encouraging signs that the economy is rebounding, there are still significant concessions Americans have to make now. Inflation just rose for the second consecutive month, keeping everyday expenses high. That also pushes out the potential for interest rate reductions further, resulting in higher borrowing costs on everything from credit cards to personal loans and mortgages. Add in the fact that millions of Americans are still recuperating from the decades-high inflation of recent years, and, understandably, many are looking for new ways to make ends meet. For seniors, many of whom are reliant upon limited budgets comprised of Social Security and retirement funds, these concerns are more prevalent. Fortunately, a reverse mortgage , which provides consistent payments to homeowners 62 and older, can help bridge that gap. Payments here are made directly to the homeowner from the accumulated home equity and will only need to be repaid in the event of the home's sale or the death of the owner. In today's unique economic climate, however, there are some important reverse mortgage dos and don'ts worth examining before getting started. Below, we'll examine four to know now. Start by checking your reverse mortgage eligibility online today . Reverse mortgage dos and don'ts seniors should know now Here are four important reverse mortgage dos and dont's seniors should know before getting started with an application now: Do: Use it for strategic purposes A reverse mortgage is withdrawn from what is likely your most important financial asset – your home. So use it strategically and not just as an extra funding source in today's economy unless it's truly needed. If you can't pay your bills, medical expenses, or more, then a reverse mortgage is worth pursuing. If you can, however, and just want to have it with no clear intended use planned, you may be better off taking a second look at your finances instead. Learn more about the recommended uses for a reverse mortgage here . Don't: Set up the wrong payment type A reverse mortgage can be provided via a lump sum or monthly payments, or as a revolving line of credit. Take the time, then, to evaluate how you want (and need) the funds disbursed. Getting set up with the wrong payment type could be costly, as it could leave you shortchanged when you need the funds most, or, conversely, with a lump sum of money you're tempted to use that you didn't need all at once. In other words, avoid getting set up with the wrong payment type, especially in today's economy, when it's easier than usual to tap into an additional income stream. Do: Compare it to alternative home equity options If you're 62 and older , you'll be eligible for a reverse mortgage, but that doesn't mean you should automatically disqualify yourself from alternative home equity borrowing options, either. With interest rates on home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) materially lower than credit cards and personal loans now, either could give you access to your home equity at an affordable cost. And, when you pay those back, your home's value will be complete, versus depleted with the reverse mortgage. To better determine the true worth of a reverse mortgage now, then, consider a side-by-side comparison with your other home equity borrowing options. Don't: Expect it to be quick and effortless You may have a paid-off home with plentiful equity to withdraw from but a reverse mortgage isn't always quick and effortless. Borrowers are typically expected to complete reverse mortgage counseling to help them better navigate the borrowing process, something that's not required with a home equity loan, HELOC or even cash-out refinance . This doesn't mean that a reverse mortgage still isn't your most applicable option but it does mean that the process may be more time-consuming than anticipated. The bottom line A reverse mortgage can be a valuable financial tool for seniors, especially in today's hard-to-predict economic climate. By familiarizing themselves with these timely but important dos and don'ts, seniors can more accurately determine if a reverse mortgage is the funding option they truly need right now or if they're better served by exploring alternatives and, in some instances, maintaining their existing financial approach."
