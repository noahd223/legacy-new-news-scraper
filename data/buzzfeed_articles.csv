Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Just a few fashion and beauty items that'll help you look effortlessly put together at all your summer outings. BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: ""I love the way these layering necklaces look! I haven’t taken them off since I received them; they still look brand new. I’ve worn them in the shower, pools, and at the beach and they are still perfect. "" — Allison Kwong Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in three finishes and 14 other styles). Promising review: ""I don’t usually leave reviews, but no joke, the best fitting and most comfortable tank top I’ve ever owned!! The material smooths and snatches you in so well, and as a girl who can never go braless, I was able to do that in this top. Literally just ordered it in three more colors."" — jaden charney Get it from Amazon for $19.16+ (available in sizes XXS–XL and 24 colors) Reviewers agree that if you want it fitted, size down. Promising reviews: ""I saw this girl wearing this exact style of dress with a Skims tag on the back, and honestly, it made me so grateful that I purchased this dress instead. It looks exactly like the Skims version, and I could be biased, but the material of this dress looked better than the Skims one. If you want it to be a little snug, I would definitely recommend sizing down one size from your normal size. So freaking comfortable and made out of thick material."" — Kaitlyn ""This was purchased to add to my summer dresses. I recently bought one in brown and loved it. So I had to get it in this purple /lavender color. Material's just as good and thick, all while being form-fitting and going to my ankles . It's still breathable, and I could move around without worrying about anything coming loose. I love that even though it was a lighter color, you couldn't see what I was wearing underneath. Perfect. I receive compliments all the time in this dress, even from toddlers . They even know a great look when they see it. Haha. 😊"" — Roxi Roxx Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in sizes XXS–XL and eight colors). Promising review: ""Love these sandals. I bought them for a black and beige dress, thinking I'd be limited to only those matching colors. After receiving and trying them on — it looked perfect with jeans too! My feet are not narrow but not wide either. The fit is perfect on my size 8 feet that are usually in sneakers. Dressing up in these sandals will present a [high-end] vibe and be comfortable, too!! I love the look it gives my feet! Dress it up, dress it down, and easy wearing — my go-to sandals now!!"" — Mrs.D Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and in six colors). Promising reviews : ""I have several pair of Rothy’s in a very similar style to these, and they are actually just as comfortable right out of the box as Rothy’s…maybe more so . I also purchased in black. LOVE THEM!!"" — Amazon Customer ""I couldn’t be happier with these flats! As a result of them dropping in price, I purchased four pairs in varying colors to wear with jeans and sweaters. Not only do they look cute, but they are also decently padded and comfortable. I have been buying Vivaia flats for over $100 and these look just as good and are more comfortable to wear ."" — PSK Get it from Amazon for $32.99 (available in women's sizes 6–10 and 14 colors and patterns). Promising review: ""I’m absolutely delighted with this long-sleeve top! The fit is impeccable , making it perfect for layering or wearing on its own. The material is soft and offers just the right amount of stretch . It’s become a staple piece in my wardrobe because of its versatility — it pairs beautifully with high-waisted jeans, skirts, and even office wear for a touch of modernity. After several washes, it maintains its shape and vibrant color . It’s rare to find such a quality top at this price point. This top has exceeded my expectations and has been a fantastic addition to my collection."" — Alaina Yvonne Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in sizes XXS–XXL and in 21 colors). Promising review: ""Most favorite hair clips! These just dress up anything you are wearing, but you don't have to fix your hair. I love the variety of sizes. The pearls are a beautiful shade of white, I get compliments every time I wear these."" — Molly Get a four-pack from Amazon for $6.99 (available in three different assortments). This lip oil is vegan, cruelty-free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. I have been using this lip oil for two months and don't go anywhere without it. It's sooo moisturizing and leaves such a lovely, subtle tint. When my lips are feeling a little dry, I can apply this to add relieving moisture *and* some lively color to my lips. I also love that the brand has various options for different preferences! Promising review: ""I love K-beauty and this is one of my favorite lip oils. It makes my lips softer and looking like cherry plump. Plus, this shade acts as a lip tint, and I like how long it stays on my lips. As first, I thought that the bottle seems small but after applying 2-3 times/day for a month I still have a lot left to use. It moisturizes your lips and leaves a red tint on your lips, and it's lasted very long!"" — Nhu Get it from Amazon for $9.50 (available in 11 colors, two sizes, and in sets). Promising review: ""I have Fenty Cherry Treat, a lip oil from Dior, and several other brands that were $20 or more…and the Nyx Fat Oil is better! Same consistency as the others, but a little more color, which is a good thing. About as long-lasting as any other thick lip gloss. It’s always awesome to find a less expensive [option] for the high-end products I like."" — Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $8.65 (available in 14 shades). Promising reviews: ""Love these so so much. I wanted the chic Bottega Veneta designer pair, but these look exactly like those for less than $20. Deal of the century. They are comfortable and extremely well made and I seriously can’t get over the price. I’m thinking about buying another color because I love them so much."" — Kam ""Literal wow. These are incredibly nice glasses — not cheap at all and very well made. The material is thick and of obvious quality. Buying these for gifts is awesome."" — Sarah Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in 14 lens colors). Promising reviews : ""My fave Skims [alternative]. I love this brand; their bodysuits are so soft and buttery, and they wash well. You can pair easily with jeans, sweatpants, or joggers — super cute!"" — RK ""Love this bodysuit; it's so soft and fits great. It's very similar to the Lululemon bodysuit that sells for $90. What a steal!"" — Katy B Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 10 colors). Promising review: ""I can confidently say this bodysuit has been a game-changer in my wardrobe. This bodysuit combines comfort, support, and a seamless design to create remarkable shapewear. The versatility of this bodysuit is noteworthy. Whether I'm dressing up for a special occasion or looking for extra support in my everyday attire, this bodysuit seamlessly fits into my wardrobe. It's become a go-to choice for achieving a polished and refined look without sacrificing comfort."" — Hannah Get it from Amazon for $38.99 (available in sizes XXL—5XL and in 11 colors). Promising review : ""I used traditional powder blushes daily up until purchasing this product. My skin is super dry and I didn't know I could have such a natural blush look until Cloud Paint! It really is easy to blend and builds up in color without much effort. The packaging is beautiful and is the perfect size to take anywhere with you. Please never stop making this blush!!!"" — :~) Get it from Glossier for $22 (available in 15 shades). Check out BuzzFeed's full review of Glossier's Cloud Paint for more deets! Promising review: "" I love these — they are so soft and comfy. The white is not see-through at all. I also got the coral, and it is beautiful."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $7.29+ (available in sizes S–3X and 36 colors) Promising review : ""I'm so excited about this belt for the price. It's good quality for the price, fits well, and has a designer look without really looking like a tacky knockoff. I give five stars!"" — kalyjo Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XL and 10 colors). Promising review: ""I have the kind of eyebrows that look very full with brushing, but can quickly look like one has 'collapsed' once my hair or something else touches it. I’ve used nearly every product from Anastasia Beverly Hills, but never had luck keeping my brows in place. Well, let me tell you, this stuff is no joke. I had to scrub my eyebrows clean tonight to get them to move. If you need some help holding your fluff, this will be your new favorite product. Also, I was able to ditch the eyebrow pencil since this stuff holds every hair in the place you brush it ."" — Bailey M, Deacon Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in a one- or two-piece set). Promising review: ""I have always stayed away from foundation because I could never get the color right, it was thick, felt gross on my skin, then would look too heavy. THIS IS AMAZING! I will forever purchase this. It’s light, smooth, and matches my skin. It doesn’t cake into my fine lines and makes my skin look perfect. It’s creamy and soft and moisturizes my skin without it feeling sticky."" — Ot Get it from Glossier for $28 (available in 12 shades). Wear it alone or as a base for your makeup! Check out this TikTok to see how it looks being applied! Promising review: ""I’m obsessed with this product. I have fair skin but I use the deep shade anyway and it makes me look like I have a glowing tan. I get compliments every time I wear it. It is sparkly but subtle. If you don’t have time for a full face of makeup, this really pulls it together with just this one product — the sparkle adds a highlight effect and the tone warms up my complexion . Of course you can wear it as part of full makeup too. I will never go without this product again! Please make it forever!"" — Elana Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I am a licensed cosmetologist of 30+ years and I couldn’t be more pleased! Salon-perfect, shiny, bouncy blow outs! Dries and styles in one or two easy passes ( on damp hair) and provides maximum lift if I style it that way. Easily dries and styles large sections of hair making this THE BEST hairstyling tool! Highly recommend! I use the low setting and cool blast. Surprised and very happy that I don't need med/high settings. Only caveat I have come across so far: the temp/speed setting is in an awkward place to be able to change it while using. Learning curve, I suppose. Otherwise, another GREAT styling tool from Revlon! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"" — ERJ Get it from Amazon for $29.49 . To use, just gather your hair and twist it into a tight bun (no hair tie needed!), tuck in the ends, and spin the pins into the edges of your bun. Promising review: ""When even a ponytail won't do and a hat isn't socially acceptable, pull out the spin pins. These are easy to carry in your purse for emergency hair days . They twist together/around each other so they stay kind of bundled together, and I keep them with several regular bobby pins to keep stray hairs tucked together. I find the minis are far more comfortable to wear as well as easier to get in the hair. You will still need a few pins to secure some random loose hairs if a PERFECT bun is your goal. But if you are like me and most days you just need your hair out of your face and off your neck-these are excellent since the bun stays put . Works beautifully under scrub caps as well."" — Blondiechick Get a three-pack from Amazon for $5.71 (also available as a two-pack). Promising reviews: ""Soooo pretty, it's 100% a Swarovski lookalike for so cheap. Looks exactly like the photo and I wear it every day."" — Trysten Walters ""I LOVE this bracelet!!! It looks so expensive and is heavy duty. If you want a tennis bracelet without spending thousands of dollars, I HIGHLY recommend this!"" — Gabby Little Get it from Amazon for $21.95 (available in three lengths and four finishes, as well as in a set of two). Live Tinted is a woman-owned small business founded by entrepreneur Deepica Mutyala that specializes in clean, vegan, cruelty-free beauty products for all skin tones. Check it out on TikTok . Promising reviews : ""I'll admit, I was totally skeptical of these Huesticks. I am 34-years-old, of Sri Lankan descent (medium to deep tan skin) and I've NEVER been good at makeup. I was excited to try these Huesticks, made by and vouched for by a fellow South Asian, but was worried it would look like I was ACTUALLY wearing makeup. I was pleasantly surprised after using Rise under my eyes and around my mouth, blending with a BeautyBlender and then using my same amount of cc cream and powder foundation. You really still can't tell I'm wearing makeup . I even asked my BF if he could see the orange 'glow' under my eyes before I put on the cc cream and he couldn't see it! It really was color correcting!"" — Reviewer Get it from Ulta for $26 (available in four shades). One side is the curved wing stamp, and the other is a regular fine tip liner for defining the rest of the eye. It comes in a pack of two, one for each eye. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty . Promising review: ""I have very minimal makeup skills. I’m a loner, mascara and gloss kinda girl. I’ve been wanting to do a wing for so long, but with my limited makeup application talent and hooded eyes, it just wasn’t happening. This product changed the game. After trying out the placement a few times, I got it down pat. I love how I can get different looked depending on where I place the wing. I’m beyond satisfied. "" — Michelle Hopson Get a set of two from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). Promising review: ""Okay, this is an honest review. I was SUPER skeptical because I've always been a spray dry shampoo girly, and I thought I was going to die on that hill. We've all been there... in a pinch and out of our dry shampoo and resorted to random powders and suffered the consequences and had to end up washing out hair while already running late. I have super fine hair, and it gets oily in the blink of an eye — even six hours post-shower. I tried this product skeptically, but I am impressed! Literally three dabs and my hair is happy, shiny, and volumized as if I just used a blow dryer! No drowning myself in a Batiste cloud! I'm adding this to my routine forever. "" — Chloe Plummer Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in six shades). This cream helps define your natural texture and works best on those with wavy, curly, or coily hair!! Promising review: ""I hardly ever write reviews for products, let alone add a photo of the results, but my gosh this product is AMAZING. The was just after my first use and I got immediate, satisfying results! Normally, I’d have to take a wand or curling iron to get this effect, but literally all I had to do with this product was take a shower and scrunch it into my hair, and just let it air dry. Not only did my natural waves come out, but my hair feels so soft and looks healthy. This product is also very cost effective! Highly recommend!"" — Carmina Get it from Amazon for $8.47 (also available as a two-pack). Promising review: ""I am in love with this fluffy oversized soft sweater! It's like wearing a cozy hug all day long. The material is incredibly soft, and the oversized fit adds an extra level of comfort. It's perfect for chilly days, keeping me warm without sacrificing style. If you want to feel both comfy and chic, this sweater is a must-have for your wardrobe! "" — Ashley Rowell Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in sizes XS—XL and in 25 styles). Promising review: ""I was really hesitant about buying this but I LOVE it!! I got my regular size and it fit amazing! It is super stretchy and loose so it can cover all areas. I like pulling it up a little bit and having the top area loose. It doesn't slide off the shoulder but if you want it to, it could. I love everything about this item! It is cute, comfy, great fitting, and a staple for my summer! "" — amela Get it from Amazon for $32.29+ (available in sizes S–3XL and 32 colors/patterns). Promising review: ""I don't have very long or thick lashes and I suck with makeup. I was never able to wear false lashes outside the house. Ever. And this was not my first time trying magnetic lashes. But these ones were so, SO easy to put on. The liner is very liquid so it was easy for me to apply and fill in. I used the last set from the natural lashes side for the look in the pics."" — Mona Get an eight-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 (also available as a 10-piece set). Promising review: ""This is a beautiful sweater. It's not too hot, but thick enough that it feels expensive. I wore it to a few work meetings with black pants, and it is very classy and put-together looking. It is a bit more expensive than I would have liked, but it is worth it. I bought the black and tan — very chic! "" — Beaulilie24 Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in sizes S—XL and in 10 colors). Promising review: ""Exactly what I wanted and needed! Keeps my hair out of my face and in so many colors that will go with anything. Doesn’t slide off and not too tight."" — Jojo96 Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 15 color varieties).

Now everyone takes time to put their shoes in this and the area looks so nice. I’ve had many compliments on it."" — Vicki Davis ""I’ve had open shoe racks and the shoes were always falling out. Now all my shoes are contained and organized and hidden in a nice cabinet that’s low profile ."" — Kirsten Soquel Get it from Amazon for $117.99+ (available in two colors).

I am very happy with this purchase!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors).

Good value for the money!""  — Ichi Ban Get it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in five sizes and seven colors). It comes with a removable liner for the hamper that can be easily lifted out and wiped clean with a damp cloth. Promising review: ""Straightforward assembly and a beautiful product, I was really happy. This looks perfect in a small bathroom, and hides the unsightly laundry pile nicely. I keep makeup on top and extra toilet papers in middle, with plenty of space. The bamboo is nice and water resistant too, so deals well with humidity."" — AJohns Get it from Amazon for $76.68 . Promising review: ""This is amazing!!!!! It looks like a different fireplace. I have been looking at a horrible grout repair that the previous owners did for 20 years. I did this in about two hours!!!!!! This product is fast, it's easy to use, easy to clean up, and inexpensive ."" — Denise Get a pint from Amazon for $26.96+ (available in three sizes/styles).

Won’t regret."" — April Olsen Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in two sizes and three colors). No tools required! It comes with a two-way clamping design that works on both horizontal and vertical surfaces. It's compatible with desks that are up to 3.1 inches thick. BedShelfie is a POC-owned small business that focuses on space-saving solutions for the home. Promising review: ""First impression of the CarryUp, the build of it is solid and felt heavy. The weight of it made me confident it will hold up well and last me a long time. Overall setup was a breeze. No tools needed at all. One sentence that sums up this product for me ... Simple and effective!!!!! If you have messy cords underneath your desk then don't think, just buy this product."" — Eddie Sadiwa Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (also available in green). Promising review: ""So easy to put together I could put it together with my eyes closed. It fit amazingly perfectly between the tub and the toilet and it has created so much more space and my bathroom is no longer cluttered because of this product."" — COS45B Get it from Amazon for $25.10 (available in two colors). OK, so painting your concrete patio may not sound like the easiest upgrade but if you're no stranger to painting and want a big impact, give it a try! Promising review: ""Works great. Used it in the basement for a quick, simple, inexpensive upgrade to brighten up the floor a bit and give the cement a clean look. Did a fairly good job filling in some of the hairline cracks as well."" — T Get a gallon from Amazon for $35+ (available in silver gray or slate gray). Promising reviews: ""I absolutely, LOVE this litter box cabinet. I used to keep it in my closet until noticing my clothes would have a chalky film on them. This is perfect! ! Not only does it hide the box itself, but it helps contain any smells that are beginning to emanate from the box. I clean it out every other day and have never noticed any odors. I also took out the divider, because my box was a few inches too long. All changing supplies are kept inside, so it works out great! I HIGHLY recommend, this litter box cabinet!!"" — Angie ""This is the perfect way to conceal a litter box as well as the odors and dust that come with them. I have noticed a significant difference in the air quality in my home, it is as if I don't even have a litter box."" — Annie Get it from Wayfair for $75.99+ (originally $79.99; available in five colors). While restoring a finish isn't quite the same as completely refinishing a piece, it takes much less time and can still make furniture (and floors , front doors , and kitchen cabinets ) look magically new again. Promising review: ""Very easy to get results. I applied to eight dining room chairs which had scrapes, scuffs, and white paint marks. An amazing transformation so quickly. I finished eight chairs in 90 minutes without rushing. I bought two pints but only one was necessary. I used a cotton cloth for most of the application but also used 0000 steel wool for the scrapes and paint removal."" — Grumpy Neanderthal Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in eight wood finish colors; also available in larger sizes ). Many reviewers follow up with the same brand's wood polish and conditioner (they're meant to be used together!), which you can get for $10.47 from Amazon. Former BuzzFeed Shopping editor Abby Kass says: ""I used a similar kit on my TV stand after moving it into my current apartment, and it worked great! It was super easy to use — you just color in the scratch. And you can't tell the difference. It's amazing! And next time I move, I'm def hiring movers."" Promising reviews: ""I can’t believe how well these work! Much better than I was expecting. I just had my home interior painted, and the painters damaged a fiberboard medicine cabinet when they removed the masking tape. It ripped off the fake-wood veneer. These markers completely filled in the ugly spots, and the colors blended well. I love that it appears to have some clear coat in it, too, as it dries with a slight shine that makes it look more like wood stain rather than marker. I also used them to stain wood filler in two spots in my maple kitchen cabinets where a previous homeowner had hung a paper towel holder, and I really struggle to see the hole! It looks fantastic. I highly recommend this set. It’s a good value and works very well."" — Shane ""These are great. I have several finishes on different pieces of furniture, and after several years, they were showing lots of scratches. Not anymore. Super easy to use and covered everything. Wasn't sure after paying such a minimal price that they'd work, but they really do."" — Kindle Customer Get a set of 13 markers from Amazon for $13.99 . You can also line the top of a pergola with these vines for some shade, letting a bit of dappled sunlight pass through for a gorgeous effect! Promising review: ""This was exactly what we needed for the backyard. It definitely provides enough privacy, and it gives the backyard a very nice ambiance! The leaves completely blend in with the other trees and plants we have in the backyard, and it looks like we made a huge upgrade in our gardening game. I'm now just hoping it can withstand the AZ summer and not fade with the sun (product description does state fade resistant). Don't be hesitant with purchasing; it's totally worth it!!"" — Amazon Customer Get a roll from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in three sizes). You'll need some green zip ties to secure them, too. You can use these for so much more than clothing! Think craft supplies, extra toiletries, shoes...basically whatever you have too much of. Promising review: "" These storage bags are fantastic. I live in a small apartment where storage space is at a premium. I use these to store my Costco toilet paper and paper towels so I don't need to make as many trips to the store. It keeps them in pristine condition and out of sight. The handles make them easy to pull in and out, and they fold up nicely when not in use. I'm thinking about getting two more since four will fit under my queen bed."" — Kimberly Dorn Get a two-pack from Amazon for $12.97+ (available in three colors and in packs of four). Promising review: ""Looks great — really ‘finishes’ off the look. Ironed very easily and looks really nice. Material is very soft and holds the pleat."" — AM Get it from Target for $27.99+ (available in seven sizes and 10 colors). Promising review : ""These look great and are super easy to apply. This is the perfect solution for hiding a cord! It looks like it is just a part of the baseboard. Mine is covering a cable wire only, but I think they are big enough to hide more than one cord if needed. I didn’t cut mine, and I bought two. You can tell where the two meet if you look closely. However, I do not think anyone would notice. I can’t believe I let our cable cord sit across the floor for this long. I wish I would have found these sooner! "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in three sizes, five colors, and in multipacks). Promising review: ""I usually don't leave reviews, but I have to with this touchup paint. I had cheap command hooks on my wall to hang up my curtains in my apartment, and they ended up falling off and damaging the wall. I brought this to cover it up since it was an eyesore, and this worked perfectly! Thankfully, I matched the right shade, and you can't even tell. It's easy to use and not messy at all. Once it dries, it instantly blends in. I'm glad it worked so well because now I can put more stuff on my walls and fix it with the paint so it won't affect my security deposit, LOL."" — N.D. Get it from Amazon for $18.95 (available in three sizes, 26 colors, and in sets of three). Clare is a Black woman-owned business that makes paint shopping easier than ever.

Exactly what I wanted and after shopping around and seeing prices ranging from $1k to $700 the price is unbeatable! Turned my dining room into a room out of a model home! "" — JH ""Wow, I just hung up this ceiling light, and my room’s got a whole new vibe! It’s got a great look, feels sturdy, and the quality’s seriously impressive. It gives off the perfect amount of cozy light, and it’s pretty stylish, too. Super happy with this find!"" — Jon Get it from Amazon for $121.59+ (available in six styles). Promising review: ""Power washer was delivered Monday, it’s Wednesday and I have washed two cars, cleaned driveway and sidewalks, cleaned back fence and the work keeps piling up , everything I see now needs to be cleaned! This little dude does not back down, plenty of power and it's surprisingly not too loud. Soap dispensers work great, and the tips are easy to change."" — MAR Get it from Amazon for $169.15 . Promising review: ""This was recommended to me by a guy who sold us redwood boards from his mill. It went on easily and it looks gorgeous! I stained a fence and two decks in the last three years and this product is far superior right off the bat. Love the richness of the color and the wood is soaking it up consistently."" — I Know Jack Get a 1-gallon can from Amazon for $32.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""This was very easy to install to hide all the messy wires. This is life changing to create a nice, sleek space."" — Martha Ashley Get it from Amazon for $21.95+ (available in four lengths and two configurations).

I use it in my living room to hide remotes, reading glasses, dental floss, etc."" — Free Spirit Get it from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in three sizes and three colors). The adjustable cord measures 5.5 feet. It does not include bulbs, but you can get a set of compatible Edison bulbs here . Promising review: ""Love these green pendants above our island. The color is a perfect muted olive green and the wood accent just elevates the look. For reference our island is 8ft long and three of these lights fit perfectly."" — Jay Stanford Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in four colors). Promising reviews: ""Bought a house with canned lights everywhere. I wanted a few semi-flush, pendants and chandeliers so I tried this product. Very easy to install and works like a charm. "" — PJG123 ""It may take a bit of finessing and maybe an extra hole drilled here or there but it will eventually do what it is supposed to do. I now have a surface- mounted light on my front porch instead of the can light the builder supplied. We turned a dark ugly space into a wonderfully lit beautiful space. We are amazed at the transformation this lighting change made to our home. Would do this again in a second."" — TDC Get it from Amazon for $21.44 . The 35-quart container comes with all the mounting hardware you'll need. Promising review: ""I hesitated to trade existing storage space for a trashcan but I am so glad I did. The Rev-A-Shelf was easy to install and worked exactly as I expected. The instructions were a bit lacking but a quick check on YouTube is all you need. Just four easily placed screws to your cupboard bottom and project complete. The fact that the kitchen trash is not the first thing guests see when they enter my house is awesome. I should have done this upgrade years ago! You won't be sorry if you purchase this unit. I love it!"" — daisy Get it from Amazon for $67.99+ (available in seven colors, or check out other options and sizes for the Rev-A-Shelf trashcan storage ). Promising reviews: ""Boy does this tape pretty up an otherwise and boring toilet. Way better than a bead of caulk. Clean....clean...clean before installation. Also helps to warm the product. Can be stretched during installation to better fit around tight bends. Been in place for a few weeks; still holding fine."" — Selaretus ""Went on easily around the toilet, [it] looks so much better. Covered discoloration around the base, highly recommend."" — Jerry Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in four sizes/styles). Promising review: ""I have a weirdly tall transition to my bathrooms and struggled with getting a normal threshold to stay in the entrance to my other bathroom after laying vinyl tile, so I hesitated on doing the hall bath until I found this product. Problem solved! Looks great and doesn’t budge! And affordable! I will definitely be ordering more for the long gap between my laminate and marble flooring in another area that I have hated for years.""— m. white Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two sizes and six colors). Promising review: ""Changed the oil on my girlfriend's car and some oil spilled on my NEW driveway...which I didn't notice 'til four days later. Four spots all about the size of a dollar bill baking in the Arizona sun for four days. Put the stuff on (sits on the stain like pancake batter — don't be afraid to pour liberally) and let it sit from 6 p.m. 'til about 9 a.m. the next day. It dried and the instructions said to just sweep the stuff up. It broke apart with the broom and the stains were gone, just swept up the powder pieces — took about a minute. I WAS SHOCKED! Something that actually works on oil and it's easy. Absolutely NO sign of anything that was there. My driveway is smooth concrete so I can't vouch for what would happen with a rougher surface but whoever makes this stuff is a genius. If they tried to take on World Peace, Earth would be a better place."" — AmazonBob Get it from Amazon for $17.97 (also available in a larger size). Farmhouse Iron Co. is a small business based at an actual farm on the central coast of California. If you're looking for shabby-chic or rustic home decor, this is the shop for you! Promising review: ""These plates are very beautiful. They match perfectly with the decor of my house. Very happy with this purchase."" — Ingrid Hogan Get it from Farmhouse Iron Co. on Etsy for $13+ (available in five styles). These shelves measure 45"" x 45"" and can hold up to 250 lbs of evenly distributed weight. Promising review: ""These are a great way to open up more storage potential in the garage. This is actually my third home when I've used these in my garage. If you have lots of room between your garage door and your ceiling, these can be used up there to allow you to store stuff in a space you would otherwise not be able to use. They're great for being able to store stuff way up high and not take up any floor space . We store all of our Christmas lights and other holiday decorations on them. They hold up the weight of four or five big bins full of Christmas light strings, no problem."" — Buster Get it from Amazon for $99.99+ (available in two styles). This tapestry measures 18"" x 40"" so make sure it'll be a good fit to cover your electrical panel! Promising review: ""I bought this to cover the electric panel in our mudroom. It covers it perfectly so now it's not the first thing you see when you walk in. Had to brush out the tassels a little bit but it is good quality!"" — J. Underwood Get it from Amazon for $33.99 . Promising review: ""Best looking metal spray paint I have seen. It took me 90 minutes to prepare, mask, and paint my bathroom faucet. I used about 1/2 a can of this paint."" — OC-Adam Get it from Amazon for $9.48 (available in several metallic finish colors). Promising review: ""Super easy to install and took less than 30 min to put together, level out, and hammer in the stakes. My HOA doesn’t allow the trash bins to be visible from the street so this fixed that issue plus it matches my house trim."" — Joseph and Anne Sawyer Get it from Amazon for $160.02 (also available in additional styles/sizes ). This DIY project is easiest if your sink or countertop already has an existing hole for a soap dispenser! This kit includes a stainless steel dispenser pump with a 360-degree swivel, a 47"" no-spill extension tube with check valve, a connecting pipe, and a 17-oz. soap bottle. You can use the extension tube in your own jug of soap (pictured above) OR you can fill the included 17-oz. bottle with your own soap instead. The kit is designed for a universal fit and can accommodate sink holes that measure between 1"" and 1.5"" in diameter. Promising review: ""It's just as described! I bought this in brushed nickel so it would match the sink! Love it! Finally, my guests can wash their hands without knocking a bottle over or shifting its spot on the sink! It can swivel 360° and comes with a longer tube, two rubber plugs to fit different-sized bottles, and an empty plastic bottle. I chose to screw on the plastic bottle directly to the dispenser so it doesn't sit on the bottom but will keep longer tube in case I change my mind later. The bottle holds on very well! The best part is when the soap runs out, I can replenish the bottle by removing the dispenser head from the top of the sink without having to crawl back under again! No tools required! Took about five minutes! Highly recommend!"" — ItsJenAgain91 Get it from Amazon for $24.95+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""I bought these to replace the ugly, plain registers that were on my ceiling. Installed in less than 10 minutes and they look beautiful. I ordered white and spray painted them nickel to match my ceiling fan. Couldn't be happier."" — AsMeow Get one from Amazon for $15.40 . This roll of self-adhesive trim measures 4 inches by 20 feet. Promising review: ""This was very easy to apply and make sure you have it where you want it before sticking because it REALLY sticks to the wall. I laid out the roll and let it relax for a day before cutting and applying. Love the easy-to-clean material. Made trimming out my bathroom/ laundry room quick and easy."" — Cassie Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in 11 sizes and seven colors). Promising review: ""[I] bought this so I could store my gardening items and kids' toys. It has been perfect. It is big enough to fit everything from my planters, gardening tools, kids' water guns, balls, etc. and it still has a lot of space. My kids use it as a bench to sit on as well. Durable and sturdy so far."" — Sid Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in eight sizes and five colors). Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:09:35.664738+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff — u/lamapuchita ""Anyway, I eventually dumped him. Years later, we ran into each other, and by then, I had lost all the weight and had become super fit. He proceeded to tell me he'd been single since we broke up and once again threw a tantrum about my weight, this time all upset that I was now thin and that I wasn't during our relationship. He actually used the word 'unfair.' I told him I had to go home to my husband and walked off."" — u/Slappyxo — u/Sisyfos1234 — u/morbidemadame — u/glamasaurus — u/GhostOfYourLibido ""This is my current situation, ughh. We've been dating for three months, and I just found out he has a 'sex worker addiction' that he is working on. 😭 I was in the hospital recently and generally having health problems, and yesterday, he said he couldn't FaceTime me to watch a movie together because he did too much coke the night before and didn't feel good…but that he'd call me when he felt better (he never did). I think I'm breaking up with him today. He never had a girlfriend before me."" — u/PaleNewspaper3 ""I pursued him ultimately, seeing what a nice guy he was, that he was goofy and intensely curious, and that we had things in common. Plus, I wanted to give him a chance. He was pretty nervous, sweet, and inexperienced in ways, but we talked about it. And BECAUSE we talked about it, and he is such a great big nerd, he would RESEARCH what I was bringing up, holy shit the orgasms were wild. He was dedicated, thoughtful, open to new ideas, and soooo wonderfully nerdy. Yeah, I am married to this dude now."" — u/masterpiecemixtapes ""It wasn't a disaster, but it was exhausting. I learned that it doesn't matter if you've had a thousand partners or none: what matters is your emotional maturity and your willingness to grow."" — u/No-Public6996 — u/Piksu4444 — u/DBones90 — u/Zestyclose_Visit4834 — u/shutupphil — u/coding_hobbit — u/AmyGranite ""When I immediately packed my shit and left he started crying about me being his 'best friend' and how could I abandon him like this? Easily, as it turns out. I haven't talked to him since, and that was about three years ago. So yeah. Didn't go well. Now I focus my energy exclusively on myself. No more helping people become the best version of themselves at my own expense. I hope he's living his best life, but by god, he'd better stay far out of mine."" — u/chronostrats ""He didn't answer WhatsApp, and when I called, he didn't answer the phone. I didn't pressure him; it's absolutely okay if someone needs some time to themselves to think about certain things. But no sign of life for a week...at least for me, that's not possible in a relationship. By the way, he contacted me off and on for months after I broke up. But I didn't feel like going to that kind of theater anymore."" — u/LutschiPutschi — u/Gullible-Ad7011 — u/hellouterus ""It's so sad because he is such a good man. I think he just needed someone to love him and believe in him. It's going really great between us. He has shown that he isn't afraid to change and grow while still being true to himself. If anything, it just makes me admire him more because being capable of change is a huge deal."" — u/SnooBananas8065 ""He suddenly/finally bumped into a girl we know back in the UK. They would never have been a situation where they'd have linked; it just happened by chance when he was picking up some stuff from our friend's house and stayed for food and DnD (I wasn't there)... They've been together now for a year, and they're like two peas in a pod...it almost seems in hindsight blindingly obvious. Like, why were these two not introduced earlier? How did nobody see it? I know she had a string of shitty insecure guys over the years and now she's with Bear (nickname) and she seems so happy. I couldn't be happier for them both."" — u/peanutbutteroverload ""So one day I showed him a clip of a henati whwre the dudes dick was four times the size of his body and said, 'I wish your dick looked like that.' Suddenly, it wasn't so funny when it happened to him."" — u/Anxious_Light_1808 ""He had a deathgrip reliance (i.e. was overly reliant on getting off via a tight grip while  masturbating, which can lead to desensitization and difficulty achieving orgasm during partnered sex), was only able to get aroused by porn-style techniques (which often don't work in real life), and was unable to enjoy real interaction and intimacy 'because it's not like in the videos.' He was disappointed partners don't do simulated porn noises and don't orgasm when you're actually not doing anything that would cause one. He was a selfish lover and disinterested in the fun/pleasure of his partner, and kept porn as a daily must. Add in the phenomenon of immediately stopping what is being done upon being told that 'this is great, keep doing it...the mind boggles. The experience was so jarring that, in the end, no sex and being alone were preferable to extremely bad sex. A partner should not feel like a sex therapist. This is not every person, but it certainly is some people. I am sure there are many sweet long-term singles out there, too."" — u/Fettnaepfchen ""He was doing his PhD at Stanford in topology — chromatic homotopy theory — and his thing had stuff to do with the Brown-Peterson spectra. I was the first girl who bothered to ask, 'What is chromatic homotopy theory?' The rest is history."" — u/sf-keto — u/HipsterWhoMissedOut — u/varthalon ""Yep, that's how it feels when you're in a scarcity mindset. I was totally cool, calm, and collected until the moment when she showed interest in me, and then all of a sudden, the stakes were sky high. I felt hyperaware that at any moment I could do or say something wrong, that interest would vanish, and then I'd be alone again, probably for another few years. Which became a self-fulfilling prophecy when I started acting all insecure and anxious, saying she was out of my league, and trying to rush her into commitment so I could finally relax."" — u/MikeArrow — u/littlefishyswimmy — u/CrickinFunt_RN ""For those who want to know, Peyronie's disease is like if a penis had a hunchback (based on about four seconds of searching)."" — u/in-site — u/rangernddare — u/_oh_for_fox_sake_ ""Yep. He was in his late 20s and had never gone on a date before. He basically got obsessed, was absolutely convinced I was his first and only true love, and wouldn't let it go! Luckily, he never tried to break the order or anything, and I now live a LOOOOONG way away and am happily married!"" — u/_oh_for_fox_sake_ — u/ragredditing ""Lollll did we date the same person? Luckily, I didn't get to the relationship stage — mostly because even a few dates in, he was already using the 'but I don't know anything, I've never been with anyone' excuse. That combined with the overwhelming 'woe is me'/'no one wants a nice guy' talk, running over my boundaries, and porn addiction, I just..could not."" — u/firelord_catra — u/GoodnightESinging ""He even tried to use my other female friends in college to talk me into getting back with him (they didn't know he was abusive and were appalled the moment they learned why I refused). After I finally got him out of my life, I promised myself I would no longer go out with a person unless I actually was attracted to them. I rejected other men who showed interest in me after that because I found none of them attractive, even though they were smart, friendly, and well-adjusted for our age. Then I started wondering whether I even actually found any men attractive at all. I didn't even know what my standards for men were; I just knew that no one ever met them and that I just dated people anyway because I wanted to feel normal. Six or so years later, I happened to read up all about compulsory heterosexuality, then realized I was gay all along."" — u/fraasu ""Of course, there are still some obstacles. He's still kinda awkward at times about being a boyfriend. And while he's aware of his and others' feelings, I still kinda have to pry sometimes for him to open up to certain things."" — u/ThrowRAIka — u/Eyfordsucks — u/Old_Yak2325 — u/the_gold_lioness ""He was so insecure that he would have panic attacks and then would leave and give me the silent treatment for days without any information. He would overthink everything and reinterpret as a criticism of him anything — like really, anything — that I would say or do or show. I was walking on shells constantly. He had given up on happiness and several things in life, and wanted me to be okay with it. These things would impact me as well. He was I think depressed and he didn't think he deserved happiness."" — u/bamibi27 — u/Firm-Telephone2570 — u/Dry-Subject-718 ""He trusted me with his heart from the get-go. I didn't have to break down any walls. He didn't have any trauma from past relationships to get through, and we don't have to worry about any unhinged exes on his side either. With this said, he made it clear in the beginning that he has healthy boundaries and expectations. 👏 I think most women appreciate men like that. He has allowed me to grow and blossom in ways I didn't know were possible for me. Every day is a new challenge, but every day we are there as a team to take it on. He is the best!"" — u/Opposite_Mango_924 — u/Different_Engine16 ""With my husband, he had not been in a relationship because of anxiety and shyness, but he had done a lot of work on himself and was confident, kind, mature, and knew what he wanted. He is an excellent communicator and partner, and he is deeply committed to me, himself, and our relationship together. He views disagreements as something we should solve together, and is loving and kind every day. So ultimately, I think that previous inexperience can be a red flag, but it can also just be a fact of someone's history that does not indicate how their future will unfold."" — u/omnombooks — u/GranddadJokes Submissions have been edited for length/clarity.",2025-06-24T17:09:35.860209+00:00

To manage your preferences for personalized ads from Google , Facebook or Amazon , please visit their preference centers This is a short explanation of how we at BuzzFeed use our own cookies and similar targeting technologies on our sites and in our apps. Note: this only explains what we do, not what our third party advertising partners do. If you’re in the UK or EU, you can find out who they are and see their privacy notices under “Partners” in our consent management platform.  What are “first party” cookies  We collect data from users of our websites and apps by placing a small piece of code known as a “first-party cookie” on your device when you access the website or app. First-party cookies collect data only for BuzzFeed; if an advertiser or other company wants to access this data, they must go to BuzzFeed and get permission.  You can also delete them at any time via your browser settings (usually under “clearing cached cookies” or a similar setting).  We do not use cookies that cannot be deleted via browser settings.  How does it work?  The cookie stores a unique identifier consisting of a randomized sequence of numbers and/or letters, known as the “cookie ID.”  This “cookie ID” does not contain a user’s name, email address or other contact details, age, gender, or other personal characteristics. When you interact with a BuzzFeed website or app, the website or app reads the cookie ID from the cookie stored on your device and then records your interactions with the website or the app, such as which pages you visited, whether you clicked on anything on the page (links, ads, etc.), and how long you spent on the page.  These interactions are associated with the cookie ID.  What does Buzzfeed do with this data?  We use this data for two purposes.  Firstly, we use it to analyse our users’ behaviour to help us understand how people like to use our sites and apps, what works, when demand peaks and we might need to make more bandwidth available, and so on.  This is platform maintenance and development work.  Secondly, we use it to target ads.  We explain a bit more about that below.  Data gathering for platform maintenance and development and for ad targeting use completely separate cookies, and we store the data gathered from them separately. Data gathered for development purposes is not used for ad targeting, and vice versa.  How do you target ads?  The first-party cookie used for ad-targeting does not transmit the user interaction history to BuzzFeed; it only stores this history on the user’s device and BuzzFeed cannot view the history. The cookie ID itself is transmitted to and stored by BuzzFeed servers.  When a targeted ad is served on a BuzzFeed website or app, the webpage where the ad is will read the first-party cookie on the user’s device.  The webpage sends the first-party cookie the ad-targeting parameters, which the cookie then compares to the interaction history stored on the user’s device.  If there is a match, the targeted ad is served.  If there is not a match, the targeted ad is not served.  Do other people give you data to target ads?  Sometimes one of the brands that advertises with us will ask us to target their ads to people who have visited their site, or to a subset of those people. One way to do that is for them to pass to us their own first party cookie data, so that we can recognise you as someone who has visited their site and that they want to target.  In those cases, that data is kept separate from our own data and is only used for that advertiser.  We never are allowed to directly access see the first-party cookie data provided by the brand.  The technology provider we use for our first party cookies also gives us the ability to make use of larger so-called “audience” data sets from reputable providers like Nielsen as a kind of overlay or additional filter on our own data.  However, we never actually see that underlying data.  Do you collect anything sensitive?  BuzzFeed does not collect and use information about people’s personal characteristics such as race/ethnicity, gender, age, or sexual orientation in order to target ads.  Ad-targeting is based on a user’s interests in specific content, as guessed from their interaction history.  So, for example, if a user often interacts with content categorized by BuzzFeed as related to African-American culture and interests, the user is more likely to see ads targeted to African-American culture and interests.

This color scheme screams '90s! It was always a true vibe being in a Taco Bell during this time period. Isn't it just so inviting and cozy to look at? '90s Taco Bell just oozes serotonin. Shopping malls in the '90s were THE place to be every weekend! Be there or be square. What better place to be than the mall with the kooky geometric shapes, bright colors, and greasy food? Most of all, who can forget all the questionable '90s fashion choices? Let's just say, lots of denim and glitter! McDonald's was a magical wonderland in the '90s. Food aside, they had the BEST playground. I have so many memories of being a menace as a kid and playing on that playground for hours. Let's not mention how germ-infested those things were, mmkay? These McDonald's usually had statues of Ronald McDonald or Grimace that were so iconic. We were total besties back then. Walmart was such a great place for shopping in the '90s. Now, the gaming section? That was my JAM. They had all your gaming needs (even if you'd nearly break your neck looking up at the screen trying to play a game demo). If you know, you know! One of the best weekend activities (besides the shopping mall) was to go rent movies at Blockbuster and have a movie night! Ah, a time before streaming services. There were also snacks, candies, and even movie/TV merch. To this day, I still have some figurines my parents bought me from Blockbuster that I have displayed (they must be considered relics now, right?). In the '90s, everywhere was a fun hangout spot. Pizza Hut hit just right when you needed a good pizza to fill you up! One of the best things to play around with while eating was the jukebox and arcade games. And who could forget the iconic red cups? What better way to spend your time at the mall than getting your glamour shot with your besties or family? These were typically awkward, yet fun. The backgrounds usually had a wild design and/or a blur effect. These glamour shots can get real awkward real quick. If you guys were anything like me, one of your favorite things was to go out and buy any type of teen magazine, rip out any and all posters, and COVER your wall with your teen crush (which changed often, so you had many posters). Probably complete with a bean bag chair and beaded curtains. You just had to be there. This may seem farfetched, but hear me out — there was something so calming (and liminal) about the school library. A computer?! In the library?! So futuristic! And who can forget one of the best events the library would have... those famous Scholastic Book Fairs just hit different back then. One of the best and most nostalgic school memories. Toys R' Us was THE place to get anything you could imagine as a kid. You could literally shop there for hours, finding games and toys that were just so top tier you HAD to get them. It was a different experience from just going to any store. Though I'm not going to lie — Geoffrey the Giraffe was a little unsettling to look at sometimes, but he means well. If you weren't renting movies from Blockbuster, then you were going out to the movie theater to watch the latest hit. Movie theaters in the '90s were something of their time. Colorful, bold, bright, and neon. I mean, just look at that lineup. It can't get any more '90s than that.",2025-06-24T17:14:53.124304+00:00

Danielle also explained that she made the decision to go public with her diagnosis in a bid to encourage others to get checked out, especially as the only reason the cancer was caught so early was because she didn’t put off her annual mammogram appointment.  Opening today’s episode of the podcast, Danielle said that her cohosts and decades-long friends, Will Friedle and Rider Strong, were two of the first people that she had shared the news with. DCIS affects the cells of the milk ducts in the breast, with Cancer Research writing: “It means that some cells in the lining of the ducts of the breast tissue have started to turn into cancer cells. These cells are all contained inside the ducts. They have not started to spread into the surrounding breast tissue.”  If left untreated, DCIS can develop into invasive breast cancer, which means that the cancer cells have broken out of the ducts and spread into the tissue. At this point, the cells can also spread into a person’s lymph nodes and other parts of the body.  Danielle explained: “I was diagnosed with high-grade DCIS with micro-invasion, and I’m going to be fine. I’m having surgery to remove it; I’m going to be on some follow-up treatment. I’ve had to make a lot of decisions over the last couple of days.” But author Glennon Doyle inspired Danielle, with the star explaining: “[Glennon] often talks about how a lot of people like to save sharing their experiences until they've come out on the other side of it, so that they're able to say: ‘Here's the pretty picture of it all, here's what I've learned,’ the end of the story. But the place you have the most to learn from is at the very beginning of a story, or in the very messy middle of a story.”  “My first instinct when I was diagnosed was to do that clam-up thing,” she confessed. “Then what I realized is, the more people I talk to, the more people had their own experiences, either themselves being diagnosed with cancer or a family member who's been diagnosed with cancer, and the world of resources and experiences that can be shared by sharing it, and things that can be learned.” “Instead, I was like: ‘Yeah, it’s time, gotta make that appointment,’ and they found it so, so, so early that I’m going to be fine,” she added. “So I want to share this because I hope that it will encourage anyone to get in there if it's time for your appointment, if you've never had an appointment before, get in there.”  “If you have to find out that you have cancer, find out when it's at stage zero if possible,” Danielle reiterated. “I have some big decisions ahead of me about what I want to do for treatment, I don't have all the answers yet; I still have doctors I need to meet with, oncologists, radiation specialists, hormone therapists, all kinds of stuff that I have still in front of me to decide.”  Danielle also explained that while she is “going to try” and not let her treatment impact the podcast, there may be times when things have to be postponed, or that she is absent from episodes. Meanwhile, Rider revealed that he and his wife have four friends who are currently battling breast cancer as he also highlighted the importance of getting checked out.  Will added: “And for men, too, prostate exams and colonoscopies, these are all things that are super important so don’t put them off.” BuzzFeed Staff",2025-06-24T17:14:53.768913+00:00

We made it 50 weeks. She called me from her boyfriend's house while I was visiting her parents (had her 6-year-old with me) to tell me she had spent the night with him. I rented a truck, got my dad and some friends together, drove to our place, and emptied it to the bare walls."" — kellydean1 "" It took the death of someone very close to me for me to open my eyes and see our relationship for what it was. I asked for space, and he [became very abusive.] I had completely mentally checked out by this point and just wanted him to leave me alone. It took him to be arrested for assault twice and a restraining order for him to get the message and to finally leave me in peace. Suddenly, I wasn't being controlled anymore. Never settle for someone so selfish and unwilling to work with you."" — sherlockwench ""The real kicker was that looking back, I don't think I was ever actually in love with her. According to my family/friends, I always try to 'fix the broken people' without regard for my own feelings, and they saw that's what I was doing well before I did. As a guy, I carried the stigma that I couldn't be on the receiving end of abuse. But if there was ever proof (for me) that a guy can truly be emotionally abused, it was my relationship with her."" — Thatdude878787 — Cygnus875 — savemoney2121 — dragonheartstring1 ""She always talked badly about her own family behind their backs (they were very nice to me). She'd always compare our relationship to her sister's and her husband's relationship (very jealous)."" — Market0 — RonSwansonsOldMan ""He became super controlling and would even ask her to weigh herself so that he could make sure she wasn't gaining weight, so that he could stay attracted to her. She FINALLY left this garbage human after a pregnancy scare. She's reconnecting with people, too, but many of those friendships are lost. If a person demands you to cut off your support system, they are not worth it. "" — Prannke — totally_boring — NeverStickEmTwice — tank_of_happiness ""Then, the baby was born, and again, he was very little help. He would play with the kid and occasionally change diapers, but all the extra dishes, laundry, shopping (with the baby in tow, of course), and cleaning were my responsibility, along with all the feedings. Soon, to his detriment, I realized, 'I could do this on my own, and it would actually be less work.'

I ate *one* Built Puff and ordered six more boxes before I finished chewing. True story.

Promising review: ""For anyone who might be a skeptic, please allow me to put you at ease. If you have hyperhidrosis, meaning it can be 9 degrees outside and you're still sweating under your arms, this product has the potential to change your life. I would sweat THROUGH a sports coat before noon. Enter the Sweat Block product. I've had it for three weeks, and it is life-changing. I DO NOT sweat under my arms anymore. I'm still on the original box that I bought three weeks ago. I had to write a review after I was cleaning the garage today in 85-degree heat...I was sweating through my shirt on my back...BUT NOT MY UNDERARMS. It is amazing!"" — Frosty McGee Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in packs of two and three). Promising review: ""Feel like expensive high-end hotel sheets. I normally use flannel sheets year-round because it’s the only material I like, but these are my new favorite. Very soft and cooling. Fit our bed perfectly. I purchased both for our bed and our spare room and have only gotten compliments from guests. Great sheets without the huge sticker price."" — Anna Greenlun Get it from Amazon for $34.97+ (available in 16 sizes and 45 colors). Promising review : ""Super happy with these pillowcases — both sides are fairly cool, but the cooling side never warms up, which is wonderful in 110-degree California summers. They do not smell (something I worry about with nontraditional linen fabrics). They do tend to get a little wrinkly, but since they zip up, they quickly smooth out."" — Tonia Get them from Amazon for $18.95+ (available in three sizes and 15 colors). Here's what BuzzFeeder Emma Lord (who convinced *me* to start eating Built Bars) has to say about them: ""Hello, I'm a walking cliché of Woman In Her Mid-30s Who Is Very Obsessed With Protein, since it took me three decades to realize I'm in a much better mood all day if I cram it in at every opportunity. I'm very, VERY picky about the protein bars I'll eat — Barebells and Nick's are my go-tos — and these Built bars knocked it out of the park! They have a truly marshmallow-like consistency and the most ridiculously satisfying texture and chewiness. The flavors I've tried have all been spot-on, and they don't leave any kind of aftertaste. I am perpetually out and about and in need of a snack, so I have one of these in my purse at all times!"" Get a pack of 12 from Amazon for $29.99 (available in several flavors). Promising review: ""The windows are noticeably squeaky clean and clear, and no scrubbing is required after only needing about 20 minutes to dry on a sunny day. I also used this to clean two outdoor glass dining tables, which are now ready for lunches and early dinners outside in the summer. Great product, definitely recommend and will be buying again!"" — Helen Simmons Get a two-pack from Amazon for $21.28 . Promising review: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months. It does have a white cast, but that can easily be worked into the hair to become undetectable."" — Meg B. Get it from Amazon for $6.97 . Promising review: ""After trying these, the pursuit for the most seamless underwear ended with these, and I came to write that on my way to buy a second pack. I worked at VS for three years, what seems like forever ago, and tried every “seamless” thong under the sun- at the store and otherwise- all of which rolled, were still visible, or the liner was not cotton, which just feels gross by the end of a workout or the end of the day. These aren’t that. They DISAPPEAR under all the workout attire. Anti-camel toe… HELLO?!?! They don’t hold sweat. They don’t roll. They don’t move around.  I just had my fourth baby and first C-section a couple of months back, and these are wide enough in the front. What is this panty sorcery? I threw out everything else from anywhere else. Follow the size guide. I washed in warm water upon arrival, even with the red in the pack, and none of the colors bled. I’ve washed 2x, and they look the same as when I first opened the box. They’re wildly comfortable for a thong from someone who despises every thong and even other styles of underwear I’ve ever tried. Picky lady problems, the list went on. Always something wrong about them on my body. NOT THESE! What!?!! I work out in these, run errands, housework ahhhh — they’re my new go-to that I ditched everything else. Comfy, sexy, stretchy, actually so seamless that they don’t exist under clothing, and a fantastic deal… It’s sorcery, I’m convinced ."" — Ebony Get a set of six from Amazon for $24.98+ (available in women's sizes XS–4X and nine color packs). Check out a TikTok of the plug-in fly trap in action. Promising review: ""I can’t say enough wonderful things about these handy little bug catchers!

Promising review: ""This scale with a built-in cup is the best thing for my baking tools. No more whipping out 1,000,000 cups.

Promising review: ""Bought this brush to replace my old travel brush. Love the storage compartment!

Promising review: ""I kept seeing this product on social media and finally decided to give it a try. I use this twice daily and it’s been a couple of weeks and I definitely noticed my pores have shrunk . I even apply it to my neck and chest area. Product is soothing, gentle on my skin (have extremely sensitive skin), no strong smell, cottons are soft, and did not cause any breakouts!

Snug Plugs is a small business that specializes in home improvement products. Promising review: ""Many of my appliances have a loose fit on my outlets, but with these in now, I don’t worry about my appliances being in a shortage because they fit so loose.

Does it make beer in a can taste like fresh draft beer? Absofreakinlutely!!!!"" — Ryan Jenkins Get it from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in seven styles). Promising review: ""Between myself (medium long hair) and my overly fluffy cat, a lot of hair and fluff was continually getting caught up on the roller brush of my vacuum. I dreaded vacuuming because it took so long to pull and snip the hairs wrapped up on the roller brush out with scissors. Not anymore! This silly, little, inexpensive thing works great! Super quick to remove all the hair/fur — in virtually a minute, then back to vacuuming with my lovely Miele vacuum."" — MKS Get it from Amazon for $8.99 . Promising review: ""Like you, when I first came across this, I was hesitant because of the price. It's a bit steep, I thought to myself. But then, after another night of bathtime with two towels on the ground to soak up the water my child had splashed all over, I took the plunge and bought it. And definitely worth it a million times over. My child LOVES the extra space for toys, and I love the water staying in the tub. I definitely and highly suggest buying it. You won't be disappointed! Or your child!!"" — Brianna Get it from Amazon for $59.95 (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I could kick myself for not trying this sooner! It is my new favorite lotion... After one night of using this, I woke up to smooth, soft moisturized skin that wasn’t itchy at all. This lotion goes on and absorbs beautifully. It’s not too thin or thick, and the scent is sensational... It’s not greasy or slick and does not have a residue that pills or transfers."" — TickTokAlice Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in a two-pack). Check out Qualify's Amazon landing page for more flavors! Promising review: ""Great product. I love the vanilla flavor for smoothies, oats, etc. It's the perfect way to get in extra protein for the day. Would definitely recommend this product!"" — Destiney Perez Get it from Amazon for $39.99 . Promising review: ""My spouse asked that I look into a product that helps lift a mattress, and she had seen this in an advertisement on the TV. This plastic tool aids in lifting a mattress so that sheets can be changed on the mattress. She told me that this product made it easier to lift the mattress and that her hands no longer ached as much as they did without using the product. She is satisfied with the product, and if she is, then I am also. I would order it again."" — Thomas Reed Get it from Amazon for $19.95 . This formula contains 4% Benzoyl peroxide, so reviewers without sensitive skin prefer this to the foaming 10% version , which packs a powerful punch. Promising review: ""This works like no other. Sometimes, when products have no lather, I can’t tell if it’s working, tbh. This has no lather but works! Improves breakouts and textured skin. I saw results in four days."" — Ellice D. Ellis Get it from Amazon for $9.77 (available in different sizes). Promising review: ""Words cannot describe how much I hate dealing with gas stations — whether it's getting gas, car wash, or air for my tires, I really hate being at the gas station for any length of time. I live in the Pittsburgh area, so the up-and-down weather wreaks havoc on my tire pressure and I am TRULY GRATEFUL to be able to check my tire pressure and fill them up from the comfort of my home. This device couldn't be easier to use, and the fact that you can lock the nozzle in place and fill the air hands-free is wonderful. I never leave reviews, but chef's kiss on this product. Can't recommend enough."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $31.98+ (available in two sizes and four colors). It also self-propels so you just need to steer, no hard pushing! Promising review: ""I confess I can be a lackadaisical housekeeper, which is problematic since my new dog sheds enough in a week for me to build an entirely new dog. What's worse, vacuuming doesn't pick up a lot of his fur. This Tineco is magic, though. Not only does it pick everything up (dust, fur, hair, crumbs, Nature's Miracle, errant Cheerios), but because the wheels are motorized, vacuuming/mopping is a breeze. I get exhausted using my canister vac, but this thing is a blast to use. Here is what I've learned: I always use the 'extra water' feature, which seems to work better. I clean the dirty water holder and parts every time I empty it, and I run the self-clean cycle after every second emptying session. This means I can do my primary bath and my 10x12 TV room before self-cleaning and recharging for a little bit. Or I can do my kitchen, entryway, and hall before self-cleaning, or my living room. In other words, you're not going to do your whole house on one battery charge or without running the self-cleaning feature several times. Of course, the reason you have to run the self-cleaning so often is because this little beauty is picking up So. Much. Stuff. It's magic. If it broke tomorrow (and I don't think it will break for a very long time), I would buy another. "" — Customer Get it from Amazon for $149+ (available in four styles). It comes with six hangers that can hold five garments each, 10 if you double them up! Promising review: ""I use these hangers for shirts and tees. They allow me to easily find any shirt in my closet and take up very little space compared to single shirts on single hangers. I can also group shirts together by style or color on a single swivel hanger. I am now able to hang additional items in my closet without crowding. I bought this in white and the edges are smooth."" — CAGH Get a pack of six from Amazon for $19.90+ (available in five colors and larger packs). Each cleaner comes with a trial size of Bissell's Spot & Stain Formula , which is also available on Amazon for $12.99 ! Promising review : ""I have four expensive fabric-covered chairs in my kitchen dining area that were long overdue to be cleaned and were so heavily soiled that I wasn't sure even a good cleaning would help. I researched all the available portable cleaning machines and this seemed to be the one with the best ratings and recommendations. I was amazed at the results when I used it on the chairs. Years of ground-in dirt and grime came out easily, and when I looked at the solution that was vacuumed out it was the color of dark chocolate. I did a second cleaning and then used a spray bottle to apply clean water to rinse. Honestly, the chairs looked so good even my son was so impressed he bought one. I want to add that I am very close to eighty. and I had no problems operating it. I highly recommend it, and I rate it five stars plus!"" — Kathleen Petro Get it from Amazon for $123.59+ (available in three styles). Kitsch is a woman-owned accessory brand that was founded in 2010. They sell a wide variety of beauty products and hair accessories for all hair types. Promising review: ""I ordered this because I was sick of keeping a towel on my head for so long while my hair dried , and if I didn't have a towel, my shirt was soaking wet from my hair after a shower. For reference, I had very long, thick hair and it takes a while to air-dry — and I'm so happy I found this scrunchie! It's a lot bigger in person than it looks in the image, which is great because it covers more of your hair to help dry it. No more heavy towels on my head or tight towel wraps . "" — Meghan Get a pack of two from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in two styles). Several reviewers say they just throw theirs right in the washing machine to clean it! They also make a smaller one designed for the bikini area and a long, narrow back scrubber for hard-to-reach areas. Promising review: ""MAGIC. HOLY CRAP, I LOVE THIS MIT! This cleared up 80% of the 'chicken skin' I have INSTANTLY after one use. Also, it took off way more dead skin than any scrub I’ve ever used. I never write reviews, so I had to when I got this and loved it."" — Cheyanne Get it from Amazon for $10.99+ (available in two colors and as a pair). Promising review: "" I've been searching for something to remove the weeds for a while, and came across this amazing tool. Since I refuse to use chemicals in my yard, I've been left with scraped knuckles every time I attempt to remove weeds. The weeds have grown so tightly in the concrete cracks that I pretty much gave up; even weed-whacking it didn't help much. Yes, you do have to use a little bit of effort, but the end result was so worth it !"" — Shelley Arakaki Get it from Amazon for $16.95 . County Line Kitchen is a small business specializing in mason jar–style cold brew makers, pitchers, and accessories. Promising review: ""This has been a hit in my house. Makes the most delicious cold brew and is of great quality. Has saved a ton of money on going out and on pods I used to buy. I try to let it sit for 48 hours so I can dilute it with a little water to get it to last longer, and throw it in my dishwasher in between uses. Perfect!"" — Jo Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes and four styles). Promising review: ""I recently tried this pimple patch and it’s incredible ! It’s truly invisible, blends seamlessly with my skin, and works wonders. It hides pimples effectively and starts working within hours, clearing them up in no time (usually within eight hours). Plus, it leaves no redness or scars behind! This product is a must-have for anyone dealing with breakouts. Highly recommended!"" — Robeir Edward Sarofeem Get it from Amazon for $6.98 . Promising review: ""I used this product for my stove because it's one thing I dislike cleaning. I have used different degreaser sprays and they all are so toxic and don't work for me. The Magic Eraser was okay but I used several at a time and I had to scrub so hard . But this product oh my goodness, legit a miracle. It doesn't have any type of smell . I put the paste on a cloth, clean the area then wipe it off with a damp cloth and voilà, magic!"" — May Get it from Amazon for $5.97 . Promising review: ""My dry neck and the annoying itchiness I used to experience have completely gone away after using this cream. It’s not only soothing, but it also feels like it’s really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It’s become a must-have in my skincare routine."" — JAcosta Get it from Amazon for $11.19 (also available in a two-pack). Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier.

This requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in six styles and five colors). These are also gluten-, soy-, and dairy-free! Promising review: ""No issues with the packaging. I love the lemon-lime taste. It dissolves in your water easily; I only used a straw to stir it up. It was not gritty, and after drinking a glass, I truly felt my headache vanish, which I felt coming on after a heavy workout! My husband uses them for hangover days when you just don't want to feel as if you are nearing death, LOL! Satisfied and definitely 5 stars. Great to have on hand."" — Britt Get a pack of 16 from Amazon for $23.46+ (available in different flavors and pack sizes). Promising review: ""I was hesitant to buy this, but I absolutely love it! It keeps my drinks cold for hours, the ice stays solid without watering the drinks down, and it prevents condensation. Perfect for iced coffee, soda, or any glass cup.

Check it out on TikTok here . Promising review: "" I have a really uneven skin tone, which is always accentuated in the morning. I don’t like putting makeup on when I wake up, and after seeing this on TikTok (I know I’m not alone in that), I bought it to see if it works, and OMG, it’s amazing. A little goes a long way, I put on sunscreen and dab this on my face and like magic, my skin looks even… even lessening [my] puffy under-eye! I never write reviews but I had to for this. It will forever be a part of my daily routine!"" — Sara R. Get it from Amazon for $25+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""LOVE.

BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Promising reviews: ""These covers are AMAZING! I used them for the first time this weekend during my bachelorette because of how much white I would be wearing, and they were perfect. I usually use petals, but sometimes you can see the shape of the petal, and my nipple still shows, but these covered my boobs perfectly, and you couldn't see them through a see-through white body suit. They lasted through the night when I forgot to take them off before bed and also lasted through tonsssss of sweaty dancing. I never leave reviews, but I had to spend the word. All my girls on the trip were amazed by them and are all ordering now."" — Amazon Customer Get a pair from Amazon for $26.50+ (available in three sizes, with or without lift, and five shades).

Click & Carry is a Shark Tank and QVC-featured small business that specializes in easy carry accessories. Promising review : ""TikTok made me buy it. This is great when you have a few bags and a box — for example, if you balance the bags, you can throw it over your shoulder and walk inside and have two free hands to carry the box, which is great. Product seems well built, and is comfortable on your shoulder or hand because of the padding."" — Hung Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I have a golden retriever and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie, this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly and everything he says is true, you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back and forth movement! However I find it's a great arm workout and it works wonders."" — Joanne Ertel Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in four colors). Wad-Free is a small biz that was launched during the pandemic.

You wonder if things like this really work and well, I can absolutely confirm it does! First, I was impressed that the package came with two of the devices because I was only expecting one. So there was one for the fitted sheet, and the flat sheet. Finally, I tried it out and my sheets not only did NOT wad up, they came out of the dryer feeling fresher, feeling more dry, and unwrinkled! I will be buying a set of these for each of my immediate family members and close friends! What a great gift!!!"" — katy Get a two-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in a four-pack). Promising review : ""I saw these on an Amazon review video on YouTube and figured I'd give them a try because my boyfriend tends to leave the toothpaste bottle a complete mess and I can't stand it! These things have a great seal and give out a good amount of toothpaste when you squeeze it. It wipes clean very easily. So glad they come with more than one but not sure what I'll use the other ones on yet."" — Kimberly C. Get a set of three from Amazon for $6.45+ (available in seven styles). Promising review: ""After I had my first child almost a year ago, I stopped getting acrylic nails because I couldn't get him out of his car seat without struggling or breaking a nail. I’d have to get them as an overlay or extra short. But I saw this product on TikTok and had to try it out, and OMG!! It works! It took me a while to figure out the best angle to get him out with it, but once I did, I went to the nail shop expeditiously!! LOL, if you’ve been thinking about this for a while, GET IT! It’s worth it!"" — Tora318 Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in six colors and larger pack sizes).

I waited a few months before writing this review because I wanted to test the product first. I am just AMAZED! I have to say...depending on the season and the place on the spike where you apply it, you either get a keiki or a new flower spike (which is awesome!). Based on my experiments, the lower the spike, the more chances to get a keiki. The higher on the spike, the more chances to get a new flower spike. If you apply it during winter (tropical area winter), you will more likely get flower spikes. If you apply it during summer (tropical areas), you will more likely get a keiki — at least that's what I observed!"" — Anne-Isabelle Bonifassi Get it from Amazon for $17.07 . This product has over 50,000 5-star ratings ! Promising review: ""I have to admit, my expectations weren't very high. I thought it was more of a joke when my husband got this for me for Christmas. Little did I realize, it would be one of my favorite gadgets ever! I don't know if I realized just how many things went missing in my seat gap. It has really saved a lot of things from disappearing into that black hole. It was easy enough to fit into my car and it's soft! It's just like an extension of my seat, except it fits every curve of my seat! There really isn't another product that compares to this. That's why I gave it five stars!"" — Tessa Forbes Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Promising review: "" This item is super easy to use and cuts well every time. I've used it at least five times already and it works perfectly. It's such a great time-saver and I've even come back to buy more for other friends as a cute little gift. This little helper makes me actually enjoy wrapping presents!! Everyone should have one of these Little ELVES!"" — Cathy Bitner Get two from Amazon for $13.99 . Promising review: ""I am so glad I ordered an extra pack of these. My goal for January was to organize the basement. I have TONS of plastic bins and whenever I need something, I have to open each to find what I’m looking for. I took a few hours the first weekend cleaning out and organizing everything and the bins. I took pictures of the contents of each bin, put one of these stickers on each bin then associated the pics with the sticker’s QR code and voila, done. IF YOU LIKE TO BE ORGANIZED, GET THESE STICKERS!"" — Fred Labro Get a pack of 40 from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three pack sizes). Promising review : ""I was amazed how real this looks, even side by side with the real thing. Of course, when you turn it over, you can see the compartment, and you will have to add weight if you want it to feel real, but just sitting in the pantry, it looks real!"" — Brenda Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in eight styles).

Attention procrastinators everywhere, you're gonna love this eyeliner stamp that'll ensure perfect wings everytime. BuzzFeed Staff One side is the curved wing stamp, and the other is a regular fine tip liner for defining the rest of the eye. It comes in a pack of two, one for each eye. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty . Promising review: ""Got this before a trip I took a few days ago. I have never been able to do wing eyeliner properly so I was excited to try this. It's very pigmented and goes on beautifully! I've tried other liquid eyeliners before and they were so watery and not close to a dark black I wanted at all but this product was great. I did my makeup and put this eyeliner on at 9 a.m., traveled two hours, walked around a city for about three hours and it was warm so I was sweating, and then went to an NBA game. After all that time (about 16 hours!), the eyeliner was just as perfect as I had put it on! I love this product and can't wait to use it more often!"" — Elizabeth Get a set of two from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). Promising review: ""Exceptionally easy to use even for lazy people like me. I saw good gradual results despite only using once daily — very happy as I cannot tolerate trays and hate strips!"" — belle rouge Get a pack of two from Amazon for $17.95 (also available in three other sizes). Promising review: ""I am a licensed cosmetologist of 30+ years and I couldn’t be more pleased! Salon-perfect, shiny, bouncy blow outs! Dries and styles in one or two easy passes ( on damp hair) and provides maximum lift if I style it that way. Easily dries and styles large sections of hair making this THE BEST hairstyling tool! Highly recommend! I use the low setting and cool blast. Surprised and very happy that I don't need med/high settings. Only caveat I have come across so far: the temp/speed setting is in an awkward place to be able to change it while using. Learning curve, I suppose. Otherwise, another GREAT styling tool from Revlon! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"" — ERJ Get it from Amazon for $32.99 (available in 11 styles). Promising review : ""You need this! Super soft hair and cuts drying time! This stuff is seriously magic. I have thick hair and I hate drying it because it just takes so long. I separate it, pin it up and spray the bottom half and dry and then do the top. It’s perfect! Agree with some of the other folks that said you need to find the perfect amount...too much you could be greasy. But you’ll only do that once. Regardless it smells amazing and your hair will be so soft! Get this!"" — Jessica W Get it from Amazon for $16+ (available in five sizes). Here's what BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes has to say about it: ""I picked up this color removal sponge from Amazon after hearing about this hack on TikTok and can testify that it actually works SO well. I'm *so* bad about cleaning my brushes (I know...shameful) and this makes it super easy to clean a brush in a matter of seconds. So even if I'm trying to do a *slightly* more elaborate eyeshadow look for the day, this makes the process of switching colors as quick and painless as possible. Also, it's *super* lightweight, and I've already tossed it in my bag and brought it on vacation with me. This is one of those products I won't be traveling without in the future if I plan on doing eyeshadow at any point — and it means you only need to pack one or two eyeshadow brushes !"" Promising review : ""This product makes it even easier for me to be lazy when it comes to cleaning my brushes. It also allows me to use the same brush for a makeup look since I can swish away a previous shadow and move on to the next. Great buy. Super easy to wash. I'm not going anywhere anytime soon, but when I do finally travel again, I'm sure this will be excellent to travel with and make it so that I only need to bring one or two brushes."" — Azaleah Bumpus-Barnett Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (also available as a pack of four). This device cooks up eggs in any style: hard-boiled, poached, omelet, or scrambled. BuzzFeed Shopping editor Emma Lord says, ""I've owned one of these babies and have faithfully used it every week for upward of two years, and especially love it while working from home — it simplifies breakfast because I know no matter what assortment of groceries I'm working with, there are precooked eggs to add some protein to it. (I like mine medium-boiled. 🍳) If my dinner is boring or seems like it needs a little extra oomph to it, I'll throw in an egg from this too. Some reviews note that the alarm on it is a little loud, but the new models have significantly decreased the volume and sing a little song instead! "" Promising review : ""I saw someone on TikTok with this and gasped! Ordered it right away. I had no idea these things existed. Super easy and convenient and the hard-boiled eggs came out perfectly. I’m testing a batch now without punching a hole in the eggs to see how they come out. Because why not make an easy process even easier?!?! LOL."" — Gina Get it from Amazon for $16.18+ (available in six colors). Promising review: "" The easiest lashes to apply!! With traditional lashes I really struggled because my hand wasn’t as steady and my eye would flutter while trying to put them on, but with the magnetic liner the lashes just latch on to the liner with no problem once the liner is semi dry. Definitely will buy a second set to have on deck. I recommend for those who struggle with regular lashes!"" — Tamara Get an five-piece set from Amazon for $18.99 . Promising review: ""When I bought my house in 2017, the upstairs bathroom had a shower that was nasty. I thought 'no problem' because I’ll just use elbow grease and clean it up. I scrubbed and scrubbed and scraped and used everything under the sun. NOTHING worked!!! UNTIL...The Pink Stuff. This stuff has done what no other cleaning product, no amount of elbow grease, no amount of cursing, no amount of anything of anything else has ever done. I’m relatively convinced it’s made with tears of the gods or just some magic that I wish I discovered years ago. My tub looks brand-new!!! "" — MNee Get it from Amazon for $5.49 . Promising review: ""I don't want to get all gushy over a pasta maker, but man...I really love this gizmo! I like spaghetti — either with normal Prego-type sauce or sometimes just with butter and Romano cheese sprinkled on. But I'm lazy and impatient, and don't like things that take a long time to make, with a bunch of steps, and a big clean up afterwards. The Fasta Pasta is perfect for me. I get the exact amount of correctly-measured spaghetti; it's faster than boiling water in a big pot then having to watch and stir the pasta; the pasta comes out perfectly cooked every time; and the cleanup is a snap."" — Smilin Sam Get it from Amazon for $17.95 . Promising review: ""I have very, very fine and fragile hair. It’s wavy (2b–2c with some 3a curls mixed in). My ends are dry, and my scalp gets very oily quickly. When the product arrived, I was on second-day hair. I worked the foam through my roots and the sides of my head. The most oily places for me. It was easy to work through, and it smelled fresh and clean. My results were amazing! My roots looked clean, no residue or buildup like powder dry shampoos. My scalp does not itch, and it gives my fine, flat hair a ton of volume. Also, my hair looks thicker when I use it. I usually can’t go more than a day or two without washing my hair. With this product, I was able to go four days without washing my hair."" — Amelia Tilton Get it from Amazon for $9.69 . Promising review: ""I've been a certified makeup artist for 12 years. Used for my cousin's wedding makeup, and they worked really well as far as catching fallout and shaping goes, but taking them off, they really stick, so just be gentle. Still great."" — Andrea Get a box of 120 pieces from Amazon for $6.99 . Promising review: ""We cannot BEGIN to tell you what a lifesaver this is! We have two old fiberglass tubs with vinyl shower enclosures that no matter what amount of scrubbing we have done with everything from bleach to cleanser to vinegar and baking soda would NOT come clean. After I took my shower last night, I sprayed down the tub and walls. Within minutes, all the built-up water deposits and dirt and grime began to melt away in front of my eyes. I left it on overnight, and when I got up this morning, it did not look like the same tub and shower. This product is a godsend, especially for old folks like us who have difficulty getting down on our hands and knees and scrubbing anything. More importantly, it performs as advertised. We plan on using it as part of our weekly cleanup routine, in addition to purchasing the Wet and Forget Mold and Mildew Remover for use on the vinyl siding of our house. This is truly an overnight sensation!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $20.98+ (available in two scents and three sizes). Promising review: ""Saw on TikTok (don’t judge) and automatically added to cart. So easy to use, takes probably a minute to fully bubble up and clean, and you’re left with a clean sink!

Uncle Funky's Daughter is a Black woman-owned company that was acquired by Renee Morris in 2014. She has used her own 20+-year natural-hair journey to expand the natural haircare line.

I just got it and already have had so many compliments."" — Meredith Coartney Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in 23 scents). Check out a TikTok of the veggie chopper in action. Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container. "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in five styles and four colors). Fly By Jing is an Asian woman-owned small business that makes sauces, seasonings, and dumplings featuring flavors from Sichuan. Here's what BuzzFeed contributor Brittany Ross says about it: ""Ever since my sister introduced me to this life-changing condiment, I've slathered it on pretty much everything I could think of — from roasted vegetables and noodles to seafood and popcorn. It's got a kick, yes, and while I'm a big fan of spicy food, the thing I love most about this chili crisp is that it also has great flavor that doesn't get overpowered by the heat, which happens with so many other spicy sauces. That deep savory flavor comes from ingredients like fermented black bean, shallots, mushroom powder, ginger, and seaweed, so it's no wonder it's become my go-to pantry staple when I want to zhuzh up my dinner in a matter of seconds. PS: Some people even swear by it as an ice cream topping!"" Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in three sizes and three flavors). The razor has two edges, a fine tooth one for thin hair textures, and a wider one for thicker hair textures. (FWIW, people also use this on their pets as a quick grooming solution!) Promising review: ""I recently got a pixie haircut, I was hesitant to get one based on the fact that I'd have to get frequent haircuts, the cost of which would add up quickly. I did some research on YouTube and found some videos using the tinkle hair cutter to trim hair in between salon visits . I LOVE this thing! It is easy to give a little trim or a drastic cut, both of which I have done since getting the tinkle cutter . I was very nervous to try it, fearing that I might mess up my hair so I just did a little bit first, but it was easy and only takes off small amounts of hair at a time, remember, I have a pixie cut — if you have long hair it will cut that off! Basically all you have to do is comb your hair in the direction it grows until you're satisfied with the cut. Seven months post pixie haircut and I have only been to the salon once to have a re-shaping done of my hair. I will say that when the cutter feels like it's 'pulling' your hair, it's time to get new razors. I still prefer my pixie cut to be pretty short and assuming I would have to go to the salon once a month for upkeep I have saved $210 since having my hair cut. TOTALLY WORTH IT!"" — brandi in louisiana Get it from Amazon for $6.49 (also available as a two-pack). It suits all dishwasher machine makes and models. Just pop them into the tray where you'd normally put detergent (or on the bottom of your dishwasher if you're washing dishes at the same time), and run as usual! Promising review: ""This really works great for cleaning dishwashers. Don't tell anyone, but I haven't previously cleaned my dishwasher since we bought it about four years ago. It had a decent amount of funk on it and it started to smell funny. That's why I bought these tablets. I used one — put it in the detergent compartment and turned on the dishwasher on normal setting. After the cycle was done, all the sediment from a few years of use was gone and any unpleasant odor was nonexistent. Zero effort required, easy to use, and worth trying! "" — Agy Get a pack of six tablets from Amazon for $8.99 (also available as a 12-pack). Check out BuzzFeed's full write-up on this spray . Promising review: ""It WORKS!! Since my husband and I moved into our home two years ago, the hard water stains in our shower drove me wild! I tried everything from bleach to all-natural remedies. Nothing worked. Stumbled upon some before and after photos for this product and had to try. Especially for the price! The photos I posted were with minimal scrubbing. The product does all the hard work!!"" — Julie Dufour Get a two-pack from Amazon for $19.99 (available in four pack sizes). This is made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel. The simple lever system is what makes pulling weeds with this so easy! Grampa's Weeder is a family-owned small biz that sells tools to make weeding easier! Promising review: ""Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weeds was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled."" — JG Get it from Amazon for $39.99 . It's BPA-free and dishwasher-safe! Also, it's perfect for parents who are still in that steaming veggies for the baby phase! Promising review: ""For years, I would buy those metal fan-like steamers that adjusted to the size of the pot; a good concept, but the fins would always fall off in short order, and they really were kind of a pain to clean (plus you had to clean the pot too!). This steamer, on the other hand, is ideal for me. It is the perfect size for a single serving and best of all, it's made for the microwave and not a pot on the stovetop. Cleaning is a breeze, and I usually hand-clean it so it's ready for another meal right away. It does take a few tries to figure out the timing for each type of vegetable, but that's okay — they come out crisp and fresh tasting. I'll never buy another metal steamer again. :-)"" — dvd Get it from Amazon for $15.49 . The temperature range is 32–197 degrees Fahrenheit. The cooker can be controlled right from your phone, so you don't even have to stay in the kitchen while cooking. It also provides cooking notifications and stays connected through Bluetooth from up to 30 feet away. Plus, you get access to over 1,000 recipes, so you'll have inspiration for yummy meals! Get the Anova app here . Promising reviews: "" For us lazy cookers! I use this at least three times a week. Great so you don’t have to stand in the kitchen waiting for your food."" — Craig R Payne III ""Since I started cooking sous vide, my family says my cooking has gone to a new level. I started with the original Anova and just recently picked up this Nano. The Nano is awesome because it's much smaller compared to the first Anova, making it easier to store in a drawer.  It sounds trivial, but by making it easier to grab, I'm more likely to use it compared to the Anova, which I kept in a special case in the pantry. Setup is so much quicker, and I can cook a beef roast for 30 hours without adding ANY water. If you're just starting out in sous vide, I recommend this cooker."" — Jeff Nichols Get it from Amazon for $78.96 . It's super quick to install, and one cartridge can last up to three months! Promising review: ""I've been using these on all my toilets for 60 days now. My toilets generally get a hard water ring around them within a few days of cleaning. It was infuriating, and I found myself cleaning toilets literally two to three times a week just to get rid of that little ring around the water line. These were so cheap, so I bought three of them and OH MY GOODNESS THEY WORK!!!!!! I've had these installed on all three of my toilets for 60 days now, and from what I'm seeing, I should be able to clean my toilets maybe once every two months now. I am so happy. If you have hard water build-up issues, do yourself a favor and buy one of these. Try it on a single toilet first just to be sure, but I think you will be happy :)."" — nima bean Get it from Amazon for $10.59 . This is dishwasher-safe! Promising review: ""A dorm room necessity! Makes pretty good rice fast and simple. Way tastier than minute rice, and no hassle of buying an expensive rice cooker or using the stove. Definitely recommend to lazy rice lovers or college kids who barely have time to cook real food."" — Cristina L Get it from Amazon for $19.90 (available in two stayles). Promising review: ""It's very light, with a huge capacity for soups, salads, mac 'n' cheese, spaghetti, stews, etc. If I didn't have any dishes, this actually would be the only thing I need other than a plate. Love the lid, as you can put it in the microwave, and the top does not blow off. It WILL stain with tomato based sauces. Who cares, as long as I've got my bowl I'm happy! Great for camping as it is virtually weightless. :) It's pretty much indestructible."" — Sheryl L. Ketchum Get it from Amazon for $14.24+ (available in three colors). Check out a TikTok of the butter spreader in action. Promising review : ""I remember having a butter holder, exactly like this, for corn when I was growing up. It was nice to find the same one. No more having the butter slip off the corn when applying it with a knife. No more tricks like using a fork and having the butter melt through the tines or how about buttering a slice of bread and wrapping it around the corn and spinning it. It’s also great that the butter is covered at one end by the plunger and the other end by a cover. This way, the butter will stay fresh and always ready when you need it."" — Allison Get it from Amazon for $6.95 . I personally have quite a few HexClad pans and a wok. I LOVE them. They have made the cooking and cleaning process a whole lot easier than it used to be. Heck, because of them, I end up cooking a lot more! Promising review : ""I needed to replace the old one I’ve owned for many years. Bought this nice HexClad 10” Wok for $95 on sale, with lifetime warranty. It’s a little pricey, but I think it’s worth it, especially, if I’ll never have to replace it! Nothing sticks to it, very sturdy, very easy to clean, not too heavy and it does as advertised. I’m looking forward to use this a lot for sti-frying, making fried rice, etc.. I do plan on buying the popular 12-piece set sometime soon."" — LAMARIZ@524 Get it from Amazon for $119+ (available in three sizes). Promising review : ""Where do I start?!?! This is honestly the best thing to have in your house . I sweep my house, and of course, the broom picks up the big stuff, but it’s the crumbs/ dirt/ sand, etc, the small stuff where even sweeping into the dustpan can’t collect it…. Well, with this device, say no more. I sweep those little crumbs, and it sucks it right up. It’s a breeze with the pet hairs as well. It makes cleaning easier. Easy to assemble. Good size, lightweight, and strong suction power. "" — Rachel Wangrycht Get it from Amazon for $149 (available in three colors). This robot vacuum and mop can even be controlled from Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri! I love this mop/vacuum combo! So I despise chores (as most people do), and as a busy mom of an infant who also works full time, keeping on top of cleaning is a lot harder that it seems. Between washing and sterilizing bottles, whipping up meals, and tidying up I literally find I don't have enough hours in the day for vacuuming or mopping. And then I got this baby. All I have to do is click a single button on the app or activate it via my Google Assistant (I named my robot Squidward, so I can say ""Squidward, start mopping""). First thing it did was map my home (pictured above), and then it started out the clean cycle. It moped my tile, and once it sensed a rug it switched to a vacuum, so my precious carpet was spared! I was amazedddd to see how well it cleaned up my floors! Plus, it totally did not crash into any furniture (and with an infant, trust me, there's a lotttt of furniture and gadgets strewn all over the place)!! It's a bit load when it's emptying itself out, but otherwise the actual cleaning portion of it is fairly quiet. All together, Squidward has proven himself to be an absolute time save for me. I highly recommend! Get it from Amazon for $599.99+ (available in white). Promising review: ""I bought this because I saw a TikTok about it. They really sold me on the video, but this is literally the best thing I could have ever bought off Amazon! When my son and niece are out of school for spring break or summer break, they are always at my house. They HAVE to have pancakes every morning, it seems. Mixing everything in the bowl and trying to pour that into the pan always makes such a mess, I feel. This eliminates the constant dripping off the bowl. It’s so easy to use; just throw all the ingredients in the bottom of this bottle, and you’re good to go! This is especially helpful with mini muffin pans! I love to make little bites at home, and this has been the best tool in helping make this baking project so much easier. So easy to clean; I just take it all apart, rinse it, and in the dishwasher it goes! Such a great purchase, and if you have littles who need pancakes more than once a week, this is for you! "" — Kristian Jones Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Wine Wash Co. is a small business based in Houston, Texas. Promising review: ""These work with all of our wineglasses, including my Riedels, thin champagne flutes, and crystal wineglasses. Our KitchenAid dishwasher came with a wine rack, but it didn't hold our taller wineglasses, so this little gadget did the trick. Very easy to use.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/monicatorres2/hardworking-immigrant-trope-rethink,Culture,2025-06-24T12:31:02.000Z,People Usually Think They're Paying Immigrants A Compliment With This One Adjective — Here's Why You Might Want To Rethink Using It,22,924,6,14,"This common phrase sounds nice, but it doesn’t take someone’s full humanity into account. HuffPost Writer In response to ICE raids in Los Angeles, Kim Kardashian, for example, wrote on social media that “When we witness innocent, hardworking people being ripped from their families in inhumane ways, we have to speak up,” while Republican Rep. David Valadao of California, recently wrote that he is urging the Trump administration “to prioritize the removal of known criminals over the hardworking people who have lived peacefully.” Being hardworking and productive are not bad traits, but when people exclusively praise and defend immigrants for being hardworking, it is not the full compliment people think it is. Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the immigration advocacy group America’s Voice, said when she grew up in Bolivia, working with “ahínco,” meaning to put “your soul and your heart into it,” was a good thing to be. But as a Latina, she has qualms when “hardworking” is used to suggest that “immigrants should just be doing the jobs no one else wants to do.” “I think the focus of the conversation needs to be on the fact that this administration is targeting people in an indiscriminate manner, and in that process, they’re really harming families and communities and really affecting not just their livelihoods, but their communities’ livelihoods,” Cárdenas said. It is true that immigrants do hard work, and without them, the American economy would collapse. The government estimates that about 40% of hired crop farmworkers that harvest food for our tables do not have work authorization. Immigrants are also the demographic that is most likely to work evenings, overnights, and on the weekends in a range of critical fields like health care, commercial bakeries, dairy and meatpacking firms, or in construction labor, according to a report from New American Economy . But they are also a vulnerable group that can get hurt on the job without recourse like workers’ compensation. Most immigrants who work on Wisconsin dairy farms frequently get hurt on the job and often go without medical care, out of fear of getting evicted and fired by employers or deported, as one 2023 ProPublica report detailed . Praising immigrants as hardworking “masks the degree to which, for so many immigrants, being ‘hardworking’ means working in risky, exploitative conditions, further sidelining people who are vulnerable, can’t work, unemployed, or trying to resist exploitation,” said Soraya Chemaly, an activist and author of the upcoming book All We Want Is Everything: How We Dismantle Male Supremacy . “Is a person [who’s] seeking safety and peace, but unable to work, deserving of care and dignity?” Chemaly continued. “In the end, the logic of ‘hardworking’ goes a long way to subtly reflect a deep strain of white supremacist, gendered, and capitalist logic in which people are ordered as resources, in terms of what can be extracted from them, rather than their inherent humanity.” Michael Lechuga, the chair and an associate professor in the Department of Communication and Journalism at the University of New Mexico, said the focus on migrants’ hard work in the US has historic roots in the 1940s-1960s Bracero Program that allowed millions of Mexican men to work legally in the United States on short-term labor contracts. This characterization of migrants as braceros “limits or reduces the migrant to the bracero ... [which in Spanish means] the arm,” Lechuga explained. “All you care about is their arms. You don’t really care about their whole body.” He noted this focus on migrants’ labor persists to this day and can lead migrants to be “demonized” by conservatives for stealing jobs, but he noted the defense of those on the left that “No, they’re actually really hardworking” is not a useful counterargument, either. In both cases, migrants are “valuable only at economic terms, but any sort of a social responsibility that the state needs to provide for the well-being of the whole human ― that’s too much of an ask,” he said. As someone who grew up in an immigrant family, Lechuga finds that being called “hardworking” brings up mixed feelings. “On the one hand, it is a way to flatten who people are,” he said. “But at the same time, in my own personal experience, that was what we were told we needed to develop in order to advance in society.” He noted that being hardworking can become a narrative immigrants take on for themselves as part of their “assimilation narrative.“ Ultimately, a more inclusive, whole-hearted support of immigrants doesn’t need to come with a qualifier or caveats of what they do or will do for the US ― it acknowledges that their existence alone is worthy of care, dignity , and respect from the people and institutions that govern them. They are not just our co-workers ; they are our neighbors, relatives, and friends. Take what Los Angeles Dodgers player Kiké Hernández wrote on Instagram over the weekend to defend the people in his city being targeted by ICE. “This is my second home. And I cannot stand to see our community being violated, profiled, abused, and ripped apart,” wrote Hernández , who was born in Puerto Rico and plays in Los Angeles. “ALL people deserve to be treated with respect, dignity , and human rights.” Notably, he includes no commentary about how productive or law-abiding immigrants are or what immigrants do for the US economy as reasons they deserve respect and dignity. That emphasis on “all” is pointed, and one we could all learn from. This article originally appeared in HuffPost .",2025-06-24T17:14:55.710963+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff “The disease is what the disease is. And I think you have to be in real deep acceptance of what that is. But for where he's at, he is stable,"" Demi said at the 2024 Hamptons International Film Festival. “What I always encourage is to just meet them where they're at. When we're holding on to what was, I think it's a losing game.” “To hug you and ask you about life and your stories and struggles and successes,” she went on. “I wish I asked you more questions while you could still tell me about it all. But I know you wouldn’t want me to be sad today so I’ll try to just be grateful reminding myself how lucky I am that you’re my dad and that you’re still with me and I can still hold you and hug you and kiss your cheek and rub your head I can tell you stories.”  Referencing her 2-year-old daughter Louetta, Rumer added: “I can watch the way your eyes light up when you see Louetta I will be grateful for every moment I have with you. I love you so much dad happy Father’s Day. Sending love to all those who are in the boat with me or have lost their fathers.” And Tallulah took it upon herself to address the criticism by replying to this comment, explaining: “hi. I hear that. As a family we use our discretion when posting. Today was a great day filled with smiles. I made the judgement call to show that to the world, because I know what he means to everyone.”  Her words struck a chord with many, who praised Tallulah for having this approach. One person wrote: “As a caregiver for my mom, who battled Alzheimer’s for over 10 years, your posts are a beautiful way of showing the joy in the small moments. Having a network of families who share this experience, and who are NOT judgmental, is everything. Those making negative comments hopefully will never have to go through this. I wish you all the best. ❤️”  “Thanks for sharing Bruce with us. It’s good to see his smile and yours as well,” somebody else added.  Another commented: “This is a loving picture. There should be no criticism of her posting this picture. Bruce and his daughter are raising awareness, so this can be cured someday.”  While one more wrote: “It's really generous to let us see these moments, because you know how much we love him, too. ❤️” ",2025-06-24T17:14:55.860928+00:00

Simone Ashley reduced to a cameo in F1. Tracy Ifeachor and the other actresses of color left off The Pitt’s Variety cover.

Huffpost UK Writer Danny Boyle has admitted he doesn’t think he could make his film Slumdog Millionaire today. In 2008, Danny directed one of his most popular movies, in which a teenager raised in a Mumbai slum wins the top prize on the Indian version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? , answering the questions based on knowledge he acquired over the course of his life. At the time, S lumdog Millionaire received near-unanimous praise, winning both Best Director and Best Picture at the Oscars, although it proved more divisive among Indian communities , with some critics suggesting filmmakers from India have not received the same reception for similar works. In a new interview with The Guardian to promote his new film 28 Years Later, Danny admitted: “We wouldn’t be able to make that now. And that’s how it should be. “It’s time to reflect on all that. We have to look at the cultural baggage we carry and the mark that we’ve left on the world.” He continued: “At the time it felt radical. We made the decision that only a handful of us would go to Mumbai. We’d work with a big Indian crew and try to make a film within the culture. But you’re still an outsider. It’s still a flawed method. “That kind of cultural appropriation might be sanctioned at certain times. But at other times it cannot be. I mean, I’m proud of the film, but you wouldn’t even contemplate doing something like that today. It wouldn’t even get financed.” Danny added: “Even if I was involved, I’d be looking for a young Indian film-maker to shoot it.” The British filmmaker’s new offering, 28 Years Later , is now in cinemas, rebooting the franchise he originated more than 20 years ago with 28 Days Later. He has previously said he hopes the movie can be the start of a new trilogy, with a sequel, 28 Years Later: The Bone Temple , having already been shot, with Nia DaCosta on directing duties.",2025-06-24T17:14:56.380985+00:00

Williams Get them from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–11 and 26 styles). You can count BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord among this balm's many fans: ""I love love love this lip balm. I compare it to the $24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on — I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go. It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries."" Promising review: ""I got this product because of the hype of it on TikTok. This lip balm smells SO GOOD. And hydrated my lips."" — kayla Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five flavors). Promising reviews: ""I saw this little potato at a restaurant counter and loved the quote so much I bought one for me and my two best friends. Such a cute and motivating carbohydrate. "" — Ess Vee ""Purchased for my wife for giggles. I figured it would be just another [thing] that was fun to open and would disappear over time.

Promising review: ""This is one cute little powerhouse. It's a fan, a flashlight, and a power brick all in one. I got this a few weeks ago to help when I'm in the throes of a pre-menopausal hot flash. I've used it quite a few times, and I just had to charge it for the first time today. The fan has two powerful speeds, and I like that it has a quick automatic turn-off feature if the blades come in contact with anything; the blades are plastic and don't hurt, but it's still a nice feature. The flashlight is bright, and the charging feature is really great. I love it!"" — HolNicHai Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in six colors). Heads up! If you plan to toast marshmallows or do any other cooking over the fire, don't add this colorant until after you're done! Promising review: ""Mystical Fire Colorant is amazing. For a really fun experience, get some of these for your next camping trip. As if a campfire needs improvement...but this stuff is really neat. I'd say the adults love it even more than the kids. We only used one packet, and the colors were so good — it seems like they lasted at least 20 minutes. There was even color left in the ashes the next day. We will never go camping again without several packs of Mystical Fire on hand."" — TeNe Get it from Amazon for $7.20 . Schylling is a small business that specializes in modern and retro toys, games, and sets. Promising review: ""Great, and I love that it has a tray to sit on.

I’ve done an escape room before and was surprised at how well this card game mimicked it ! My 11-year-old and I did it together and did have to use some hint cards, but that aside, it was fun to try to figure out mostly on our own. You have to give it a try! We’ve already selected another game to play next."" — GMP Promising review: "" If you're new to the 'Exit, The Game' franchise, this is a great one to start with. It will give you an idea of how the games work, and the puzzles are varied enough that you can get a good idea of what their range is.

Get it from Amazon for $32.99 . Promising review: “I ordered this because my 13-year-old loves the game and I thought it might inspire her to want to learn to cook. I expected it to be more of a meme cookbook than anything, and it doesn't disappoint on that front! The illustrations are beautiful! and there are more than a few paragraphs devoted to the storylines and characters in the game. I did not in any way expect the recipes to be worth actually cooking. I was very surprised then to see how much effort went into turning awful-sounding dishes like ""Seafoam pudding"" into legitimate dishes. I am an experienced chef, and after reading through these recipes, I can say there are only a few that I am not excited about trying. Even the ones making familiar dishes have a couple of unexpected twists that sound really good. So to sum up, if you're a Stardew Valley fan, this recipe book is a no-brainer, and if you are a collector of interesting recipe books with unusual, but enticing twists, this is all a must buy."" — Zachary C. Hoskins Get it from Amazon for $18.38 . Note: Slight cracking can occur with air-dry clay, especially with larger projects. One way to help reduce them is by covering your craft with a damp cloth during the drying process! Promising review: Air dry clay is such a fun and inexpensive hobby to take up (versus regular clay pottery making: kiln, pottery wheel, etc). It’s incredibly easy to work with, easy to clean, and easy to store. I’m 23, and it is possibly my favorite pastime — I’d imagine it’s fun for any and all ages. This particular clay is just the best I’ve used, in my opinion. Others have been almost rubbery consistencies — and, although they dried beautifully and were easy to sand/fine tune, I just couldn’t get past how hard they were to get off my hands/tools/etc. This one is just perfect. — Lyss Get it from Amazon for $10.62 . The kit includes 2 wood carving blocks (1 cherry and 1 brasswood), a super sharp carving knife, sharpening supplies, a birdie template, and 3 types of sandpaper. Promising review: ""What a fun and relaxing project. Very easy to accomplish a bird figure with this kit. This is a very beginner-friendly project, and also fun for experienced carvers. The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow, with pictures to guide you through the process. Everything you need to carve, sand, and finish the bird is provided conveniently in the kit. I really enjoyed crafting a bird figure with the kit and recommend this for anyone who wants to get into wood carving or is looking for an easy project for the weekend. Have fun and don't forget to strop the carving knife often to maintain a sharp cutting edge."" — J.leprgoblichaun Get it from Amazon for $32.99 . Lego has a few other potted plants, like these bamboo or chrysanthemum sets. Or, if you have a vase you've been wanting to fill, this cult-classic bouquet is a gorgeous, more intricate option.

The finished piece looks so realistic — I’ve had people mistake it for a real plant! It makes a great display piece and doesn’t require any watering. Perfect for Lego fans and plant lovers alike. Highly recommend as a gift or for yourself!"" — Jess H. Get it from Amazon for $23.98 . Promising review: “This book is wonderful for getting away from my phone and engaging with a great array of puzzles. With different difficulties and types, I can pick between a thematic crossword puzzle or just end my night with some colored pencils. This is an excellent nightstand book to end a long day of work!” — Samuel Get it from Amazon for $12.59 . The kit includes two sushi mats, a rice bazooka, cucumber and avocado slicer, rice paddles, sushi knife, dipping plate, nigiri maker, sushi brush, and four maneki-neko (chopstick holders). Promising review: "" This kit is a total blast for anyone who loves sushi, whether you’re just starting out or already know your way around a bamboo mat. The rice bazooka is a standout — it packs sticky rice into perfect cylinders for mess-free rolls, which is great for beginners like me who struggle with even spreading. The sushi knife is legit sharp, slicing through seaweed and fish cleanly without squishing the rolls, though I’d recommend hand-washing it to keep the edge pristine. The bamboo mats are sturdy yet flexible, and the avocado slicer made prepping ingredients a breeze. Everything’s BPA-free and dishwasher-safe (except the knife), so cleanup was no hassle."" — Martin E. Get it from Amazon for $22.09 . A few other popular Creative Haven books are Magical Fairies and Around the World , which is a color-by-number option! Promising review: ""Great therapy for my post-Lyme recovery, which still keeps me from my former more intricate crafts …and is beautifully relaxing after a long day at the office. Creative Haven makes some of my favorite coloring books — nice paper for colored pencils, nice detail, love the perforated pages, fabulous quality for the nice price point."" — Northwoods Charm Get it from Amazon for $4.79 . If you're looking for some markers to begin your coloring adventure, the Caliart alcohol markers are a great option — reviewers report little to no streaking! Note: This device requires Instax mini instant film , sold separately. And, if you’re looking for a sturdy case to protect your mini printer when you’re out and about, this one comes in 10 cute colors. Promising review: “I love this little printer so much. I actually bought the square printer a long time ago, but I’ve been wanting the mini one for a while now. I finally bit the bullet and bought it, and I have had no regrets since then. I use it for my scrapbook, and let me tell you, with the other printer, I have to lighten the picture a lot. But the picture quality here is amazing . You get what you print. Super easy to use and I can’t wait to use more of it!” — Lee Get it from Amazon for $89.90 (also available in white and pink). The kit includes 50 colors, 10 watercolor papers, a water brush pen, nylon brush, drawing eraser, pencil sharpener, sketching pencil, color chart, natural sponge, portable tin box, and velvet bag. Promising review: ""I LOVE this set. I'm a beginner and trying to paint one bookmark every day as I learn — 21 bookmarks so far. This kit makes it easy to take with me everywhere. All you need is a napkin and your paper, and you're all set. I do think it would be tough to make a large painting with this, but that's the same critique of any pan paints. I'm very pleased."" — Dee Bundy Get it from Amazon for $15.99 . The company offers a few other themes, like animals and enchanted forest . Promising review: “So peaceful. I was looking for something 'mindless' to do while listening to audiobooks. This is it! I can listen and not be too distracted from the story, and create beautiful sticker art. I thought it would feel juvenile or come out misaligned — not the case! Sophisticated and pretty!” — Freshlyberry Get it from Amazon for $10.65 . The kit includes 32 bottles of gel nail polish, a bottle of base, 3 top coats (no-wipe, matte, and glittery), a professional nail lamp, and some nail tools. Promising review: “Salon quality nail product!! I was apprehensive because of the price, BUT the kit worked exactly as described. I cured my nails for twice as long as is recommended, and I didn’t have ANY problems with runny or wet polish getting ruined. As others have said, the bottles are small, but to say “you can only use them once or twice” is an exaggeration. There’s more polish in there than that. It WOULD be nice if the base coat and top coat bottles were bigger than the rest because you’ll use so much more of it, but they aren’t. I’d buy this set again in a heartbeat!!” — Andrew jacone Get it from Amazon for $29.99 . Promising review: “ I have fibromyalgia, and it affects my feet if I don't wear good shoes . When my daughter asked me to take her roller skating the next day, I cringed at the thought of wearing rental skates. To my surprise, I was not only able to find women's size 11 skates, but they also offered next-day delivery to my address! These skates are super comfortable, durable, and high quality. I am excited for our new hobby!! ” — Melanie Cade Get it from Amazon for $60.99+ (available in women's sizes 5–12 and men's sizes 4–11 and 4 colors). The complete kit includes two yoga blocks for support, a mat, a yoga strap for stretching, resistance bands, door anchor, and booty bands. Promising review: I’m very happy with this purchase, the mat is thick and comfortable. I like all of the additional pieces as well. The resistance bands are so well made and definitely give a good workout!!! I would 100% recommend! — Queen718❤️ Get it from Amazon for $59.99 (also available in pink) Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:14:57.248110+00:00
BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniesoteriou/brooklyn-beckham-nicola-peltz-proposal-best-decision,Celebrity,2025-06-24T13:27:48.000Z,Brooklyn Beckham Has Asserted That Marrying Nicola Peltz Is The “Best Decision” He Has Ever Made In A Defiant Instagram Post Amid His Rumored Family Feud,26,689,20,11,"Brooklyn’s gushing tribute to Nicola comes after he completely snubbed his dad, David Beckham, on Father’s Day. BuzzFeed Staff Throughout 2023, it was widely speculated that Nicola and Victoria were at odds , however, they appeared to put whatever beef they had behind them at the start of 2024, when they returned to being incredibly vocal about how much they adore one another in social media posts.  But this didn’t last very long, with the feud rumors resurfacing earlier this year when it was noted that Brooklyn and Nicola had skipped all three of his dad, David Beckham’s , 50th birthday celebrations, which spanned from March until May.  A source later told People : ""There are tensions between Brooklyn and Nicola and the family,” before insisting that “the relationship is definitely not beyond repair.”  The insider also said that the couple had been invited to David’s celebrations but chose not to attend, adding that the Beckhams “love and are always there for” Brooklyn, but are “hurt and disappointed that he’s now playing no part in family life.” According to a source who spoke to People , Nicola left the room in tears and feels as though Victoria “ruined her wedding.” Another insider added to the same publication: “Brooklyn feels torn. It’s his family and blood, but he’s always had a complicated relationship with his dad. A lot of their relationship has felt like ‘business.’”  It’s worth noting that the wedding was three years ago, and it isn’t known why any ill feeling between Nicola and Brooklyn and his family would have resurfaced now. And his cryptic Instagram post came soon after Cruz seemingly sprang to his parents’ defense after Brooklyn called Nicola his “whole world” in a divisive Instagram post that appeared to allude to the family beef.  “My whole world x I will love you forever x I always choose you baby x you’re the most amazing person i know xx me and you forever baby,” Brooklyn wrote at the time, sparking backlash from followers who accused him of shading his parents.  But Brooklyn is standing firm, with the 26-year-old shocking people when he completely snubbed David on Father’s Day earlier this month, despite David gushing about all of his children, including Brooklyn, in multiple posts that were shared throughout the day.  Brooklyn also publicly ignored his dad being awarded a knighthood by King Charles III the day before Father’s Day, despite the rest of the family sharing their pride. After being asked: “What’s something about love you didn’t know before this relationship?” Brooklyn replied: “You should marry your best friend. Someone who feels like home. For me, that’s Nicola.”  He also suggested that he is not interested in the constant scrutiny that their relationship with his family faces when asked how he protects their romance in the public spotlight. He said: “Ignore the noise. Keep your head down, work hard, be kind. People are always going to talk. What matters is that we’re happy together.” Sharing a photo of himself kissing Nicola on the cheek as she takes a mirror selfie, Brooklyn wrote: “It’s been 5 years since I asked this beautiful woman to marry me xx best decision ever x I love you so much ❤️”  However, some found this post to be in bad taste as they called Brooklyn out for appearing to choose Nicola over his parents and brothers in the comment section.  “Not cool how you’re treating your parents and brothers,” one person wrote. Another popular comment advises: “One day, you will realize that your Mum and Dad won't be around forever, and believe me, unless they have done something totally unforgivable, you need to make your peace or you'll regret it until your dying day. I dont know you Brooklyn, but maybe take a little time to assess your values and more importantly, your direction in life.”  “It’s a shame you allowed it to come between you’re parents and siblings. Really sad,” somebody else added, while one more wrote: “You will regret missing out on such wonderful family moments. Falling in love is wonderful! Remember the start of your journey into life.”",2025-06-24T17:14:57.382525+00:00

I tested it on all the different areas of my body. It didn’t do a thing to my well-exfoliated palm, but my face, legs, LIPS… baby soft with big balls of dead skin coming off . Like one of those Korean exfoliating gloves, but you don’t have to scrub like you do with those. You just gently rub it in, and your dead skin peels away .

Wonderful!"" — Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). Promising review : ""This 100% works. Two weeks after the first use and I’m afraid to say it out loud but we have ZERO drain flies. We’ve been inundated every spring and summer for the last few years. Biblical plague level. Nothing has worked: baking soda, boiling water, other drain treatments. Nothing. Until Terro. I will buy this every year until I die. "" — Seth Parry Get it from Amazon for $15.97 . Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms.

I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" — Monica T. Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" — Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.99 . Quitch is a small business that specializes in family-friendly bug repellent and bug bite relief products. Promising review : ""I don’t know how this works but it helped my itching SO MUCH! It sticks quite well and even stayed on after a shower. I got them because I was traveling to an area that had lots of mosquitos. I would be itching so bad but once I placed one on the bite, it reduced the itching to almost nonexistent. The pack comes with different sizes. It’s helped with not scarring my legs from the bites. I’ll definitely rebuy this for summer. It’s so easy and great to just throw in your bag."" — Holly C. Get a pack of 36 from Amazon for $9.95 .

I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify!

Here's what BuzzFeeder Jenae Sitzes says about it: ""I finally tried out this tool with my Crave Naturals brush , which I used for (*checks Amazon order history*) TWO YEARS without every doing a deep clean of it. I mean, sure, I would regularly pull out the loose hair and whatever I could get to using my fingers, but there was always this gross layer at the bottom I couldn't reach, and I kind of just tried my best to pretend it wasn't there. LET ME TELL YOU: This tool is genius. With barely any effort, it pulled out that gross, years-old layer of *stuff* at the bottom of my brush (the photo above shows that layer already ~dislodged~ by the tool , right before I pulled it out), and now I don't have to feel disgusting every time I run it through my hair . It actually feels like it's doing a better job of *brushing* now too! Seriously, if you are a human with brushable hair on your head, you need this."" Get it from Amazon for $11.95 .

My husband has had a lot of earwax impaction problems in his life, and up until this point, we have paid to have a professional take care of it. But recently, he suddenly lost about 80% of his hearing and just couldn't wait for an appointment, so we bought this item. From the reviews I have read, it was a particularly easy solution for my husband. Nasty huge chunks start falling out after just a couple of squirts. Cleared everything out, no problem.

Promising review: ""I recently tried the Olay Super Serum Body Wash, and I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is incredibly hydrating, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth after every use . It lathers beautifully and has a lovely, light fragrance that isn't overpowering. After just a few uses, I noticed my skin looked more radiant and felt deeply moisturized. The addition of serums in the body wash is a game-changer. My skin feels nourished, and I no longer need to apply lotion right after showering. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a luxurious, skin-loving body wash!"" — Darina ""I have been using Dove moisture body wash for a long time, but it just wasn’t getting the job done.

I also have fairly sensitive skin and this has yet to cause any irritation on my lips which is a huge plus.

Promising review : ""The 'abrasive sponge when cold' or 'squishy when hot' is an awesome feature for the type of scrubbing you want to do. The Pink Stuff with the sponge does wonders!

It provided instant cooling relief and took the sting out of my sunburn right away . The spray made it easy to apply without having to rub it in — perfect for those sensitive areas. The aloe was super soothing, and the lidocaine helped calm the burn fast. It absorbed quickly and didn’t leave any sticky feeling behind. Definitely a must-have for any sunny vacation or cruise — I'll never travel without it again!"" — Barbara Get it from Amazon for $9.98. Promising review: ""I saw this product on TikTok and decided to try it out for myself. The name doesn’t lie — spray it on, shut the bathroom door, and in a few hours, the shower is 100 times cleaner. Usually I’ll let it sit overnight, and by morning, the visible grime on the shower is gone, including soap scum. I’ll usually let the shower water rinse the residue out, and then will take a bucket just to get everything off the shower walls. It is a bit slick if you try to get in the shower without rinsing the residue, but otherwise it’s a worthy cleaning staple in my house."" — Tara D.

Promising review: ""This stuff really is magical! When we moved into our house, the previous owners did a horrible job of cleaning the stainless-steel appliances. There were permanent run marks going down the front that I could not remove....and I tried EVERYTHING. I should note that I’m not actually positive that these appliances are true stainless steel or just manufactured to look like that. I wanted to cry tears of joy after wiping down the dishwasher because I had been looking at those awful run marks for three years, and they were finally gone! The whole tub is worth it for that appliance alone. "" — MayBae Get a pack of 90 from Amazon for $14.98 . Promising review : ""These are the best for half of any round fruit or vegetable.

I had originally bought a completely different brand (because I was being cheap), and let me tell you, you get what you pay for. I found these Loop earplugs and decided to give them a try and I’m so glad that I did! They are so comfortable! Made from silicone so they are flexible and fit great . I’ve slept with them in all night without issues. The noise cancelling is fantastic! Now does it block everything? No, but I think that’s a good thing for safety reasons. They do block my husband’s chainsaw snoring and that is exactly what I needed them to do.

Joesoef Skin Care is a small business that specializes in anti-acne skincare products. Promising review: ""I recently saw a dermatologist talk about those clogged pores on and around your nose. If they are of uniform size, they aren't blackheads. She suggested using a sulfur soap to get rid of or minimize those stubborn clogged pores. This has a slight sulfur smell, it is not overwhelming, and it disappears when dried. It works! My pores are much smaller. After applying and drying, moisturize.

The cost was $700 but I could have one for $500. I decided to try a less expensive alternative. I purchased these and woke up this morning pain free. They are comfortable and I had no problem falling asleep. Pain is gone and I saved $500. I would say that's a win-win.

Promising review: ""I rarely ever get pimples, but every once in a while, when I do, they seem to last forever. A coworker of mine suggested I try this. I am SO happy I did. I had one very large pimple and two tiny ones — when I used this, they were all gone by the time I woke up . It does have a semi-potent smell, but it goes away after applying. I have never used a product like this before. I am so pleased to have this. I have very sensitive and dry skin, and this did not irritate my skin at all. I find it fun to put on. Would definitely buy again in the future."" — Stephanie Get it from Amazon for $20+ (available in glass or plastic bottle, and in packs with drying patches). Juno & Co. is a small business specializing in personal care and skincare products. Promising review: ""I’ve loved the Farmacy Green Clean for many years, but at $30+ for a jar that lasts 1–2 months max, it was a pricey product to buy on a regular basis. I wanted something just as good at a lower price and I FOUND IT! This cleanser absolutely melts away makeup and deep cleans the skin without any drying or eye irritation!

You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review : ""Like a lot of women over 50, I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas . Best of all, it does not settle into pores or fine lines at al l. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" — Chartwell Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted). First Aid Beauty is a US-based small business that specializes in clean, fragrance-free, cruelty-free personal care products. Promising review: ""These have been a game changer for me! For as long as I’ve been shaving, I always end up with bad razor burn and ingrown hairs :/. I switched to waxing for a while, but with summer around the corner that’s not ideal to keep up with. I was looking for a product that would help soothe my irritation and decided to try these. They’re easy to use and have really helped my skin! I use them right after my showers when I shave (armpits and down below) and then in the mornings the next day to keep irritation down, and they’re great. No burning or weird residue left after. 10/10 would recommend!"" — Tori Wag Get a set of 28 pads from Amazon for $18.53 . Promising review: ""First off, if you have extremely oily skin, this. is. it. I was so tired of getting blotting powder/wipes. It felt wasteful and always left residue on my face. I saw this on TikTok and NEEDED it. It was backordered but then I got an email saying it was in stock and I was SO excited. Not only is it affordable, but it's washable, which helps you save money and be less wasteful."" — Kelsey B. Get it from Amazon for $7.75 . I have been buying a new set of these every year since 2020, and they have kept my VERY blister- and chafing-prone feet snug and moisture-wicked on every single long run . They've essentially phased out any of my other socks, because they're extremely comfortable to boot. As a runner who often clocks in 25+ miles a week and often in some ""yikes!"" summer heat, I cannot recommend these socks enough. Promising review: ""These socks are designed perfectly for running socks. The bottoms and toes are thick, the tops are thin, the lower heel is reinforced, the heel top has a tab that provides extra cushion on the Achilles where some shoes like to wear into you.

Peach Slices is a small business that specializes in affordable skincare products. Promising review: ""I use these once a week and they really help my huge nose pores look way smaller and cleaner . The first time, I still had some oil and gunk in my pores, but the second time, I had even less. By the third time I used them, the only oil was on the patch, and my nose has never looked better. My pores appear smaller, and my nose is smoother."" — Sarah Cavasos Get a pack of seven from Amazon for $9.98 . First Aid Beauty is a US-based small business that specializes in clean, fragrance-free, cruelty-free personal care products. Promising review: ""I saw a dermatologist recommend this on TikTok, and I figured I’d give it a try. I have had red bumps on the back of my arms for as long as I can remember and have tried multiple things, so I didn’t have very high expectations . After one use, I could already see a difference! It says to use it 1–2 times a week, but I use it usually every other day, and I use Cerave rough and bumpy lotion after, and now my red bumps are almost nonexistent. This product has truly been life-changing, and I would recommend it to anyone struggling with red bumps! 10/10! "" — Sydney Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes).

This shampoo was designed to work for sensitive scalps, color-dyed, and chemically processed hair, as well as for all hair types and textures, with reviewers with 3b–4c curls mentioning it worked for them. Promising review : ""I was hesitant. I have been dealing with dandruff for almost 10 years, fortunately not that heavy but enough where it was embarrassing. I tried everything. Leave in conditioner, tea tree oil, Head and Shoulders, etc. One brand did work for a couple of days but that's it. But this product has worked EFFECTIVELY. Dandruff-free for two months so far. Can leave your hair feeling a little dry so just use conditioner and it will balance out. If other products aren't working for you with dandruff I can confidently recommend this one."" — Martin C. Get it from Amazon for $15.88 . Promising review: ""TikTokers have done it again. This was one of the products on Amazon a person could not live without, stating all-day freshness. It's true, I cannot believe it. The taste isn't strong. It does not burn at all. It keeps my breath smelling fresh all day, no matter what I eat. This brand will be a new staple in my bathroom and morning routine."" — Zac Get a two-pack from Amazon for $15.34 . You should change the pads every 48 hours, and note that they do not work on moles, birthmarks, warts with hair growing from them, genital warts, or facial warts. The brand notes that you should not use this product if you have diabetes or poor blood circulation. Promising review: ""These work amazingly well! I had taken my daughter to the dermatologist and paid a hefty amount for them to burn a wart off of her arm . It didn’t get rid of it; they only made it smaller, and they recommended a follow-up appointment. Then I found these! She wore one overnight, and literally the next day, it was smaller to almost nothing. Looked just like a small scar. Now it’s completely gone after wearing it only two times. One time overnight, and the next day. That’s all! I will never try any other treatment for warts except for this!"" — Cole Hagele Get a pack of 14 from Amazon for $7.29 . Promising review: ""I was skeptical at first, but I’m so glad that I purchased this. I finally cut my hair short after losing so much hair and thinning.

BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: ""It is a lifesaver . If you can't fit or afford a full sit-stand desk, this unit has been going up and down a few times a day for 6 months strong . Also if you think you will be standing for more than a couple of hours a day, I assure you no.

I have a FlexiSpot electric standing desk at home ( this one, specifically ) and love it — it's a great brand, and mine hasn't given me any issues over the past few years.

It will be the perfect addition to your workspace."" — Rebecca Jeanette ""After assembling it, I am thrilled I chose this desk. With a press of a button, I can raise and lower it to appropriate heights for either comfortably sitting or standing (I'm 5'10""). The material itself is very sturdy. There are NO drawers, which, after 20 years of having the other home desk and having desks at work, I realized that drawers do nothing more than collect and store junk. Can't do that with this desk as this desk encourages minimalism and storing that junk somewhere else."" — David Taylor Get it from Amazon for $149.99+ (available in five sizes and 12 styles).

I work from home and having the ability to hop on this thing regularly throughout the day is a lifesaver. The quality is top-notch, no issues whatsoever in the 3 months I’ve had it. Not having the room (in both my space and budget) for a treadmill, having cardio equipment that allows for a natural standing, upright position is critical for keeping my back healthy.

This product is amazingly perfect, so much so I bought a second set for one of the drawers in the kitchen."" — Gentles Lewis Get a six-piece set from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in two larger sets). I've had this exact lumbar support pillow since 2018, back when I was still working in an office, and I can't express enough how much it's improved my posture and reduced back pain after long hours of sitting . I initially got it because I was stuck working in one of those awful office chairs with zero lower back support, and years later, I still use it at home. It fills the curve of your spine *perfectly*, and you can adjust the positioning as needed, with straps that go around the back of your chair to hold it steady. I personally use it in conjunction with an ErgoFoam footrest , and I never have back pain after working anymore. Promising review: "" Saved my life . I bought this for work and it’s been so incredibly comfortable for my back, especially since I’m a petite and short person, I can’t sit against the chair or else my legs will be strained.

If you’re short I would recommend getting this + a footrest ."" — Aja Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in five pillows and a bundle with their seat cushion). The cover is removable and washable! Promising review : ""I have a cute but not great desk chair that I sit in all day in my home office, and my back was KILLING ME — it was making an old tailbone injury worse, and my spine was hurting a lot. I didn't want to spend $$$ on a new desk chair, and I figured this pillow was a good way to bridge the gap. I've been using it 8 hours a day for two months, and it's fantastic. I have zero back pain at all anymore, and it's sturdy and hasn't worn out or gotten less cushy. Highly recommended, and much better than getting a fancy new ergonomic desk chair that costs hundreds of dollars."" — Bee_87 Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in six colors).

Sleek Socket is a small biz focused on sleek power outlet solutions for the home! Promising review: ""I have a velvet lounge chair that sits up against the wall and covers an outlet. Every time we need to plug our phones, vacuum, laptops, or anything, I would have to move the chair to ensure the cord/plug doesn’t ruin the material. This outlet cover was a lifesaver! Lays perfectly flush up against the wall with the added befit of a third available plug, and sits neatly under my lounge. Love this product!"" — lisa ledoux Get it from Amazon for $21.95+ (available in four sizes and two styles). This whiteboard also comes with a dry-erase marker, an accessory channel (to hold the marker), and a storage drawer. Promising review: "" When working from home, this was a lifesaver! I saved paper by jotting down reminders, notes, and to-do lists that stayed in sight, and therefore, on my mind. I no longer work remotely, but this continues to be useful for home life reminders, such as bill payments, shopping lists, and the next shows to binge, LOL. I use the marker that came with it, as well as markers from other brands, such as Expo."" — D. Williams Get it from Amazon for $26.99 (available in five styles). Promising review: ""Absolutely love these cable clips. I have used them around my desk for holding charger cables so they don’t continuously fall. It has also been great with holding up to four charging cables for charging all my children’s school tablets. This has been a lifesaver with keeping these organized amongst all the chaos right now. Highly recommend."" — Leighann R. Get a six-pack from Amazon for $6.97 . Promising review : "" For anyone with cable clutter, this is a god-sent solution. You can even stick it if you're mounting it to a wall. These days everything is electric and there are just too many wires in my house. I can used this to make everything look clean again. I love how my house looks now. Lifesaver! "" — David Rizk Get a pack of six from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in three colors). It comes in two pieces — one you can prop in front of your keyboard, and the other in front of your mouse. Promising review : ""Being that I have carpal tunnel, the pain in my wrist and arm was becoming unbearable. I ordered these while working from home and these have been lifesavers. The pain has subsided and I wish I’d purchased these sooner. Excellent purchase and highly recommended!"" — BlessedMomma Get it from Amazon for $13.81+ (available in 15 styles). I use this mat anytime I use my standing desk in its lifted position, because standing barefoot on my hardwood floor for any lengthy period of time is *not* the greatest feeling. That said, you can use this with shoes on, too, if you're at the office! It's designed to wipe clean . Promising review: "" This mat has been a lifesaver with my standing desk . It has a nice cushion in depth and has enough width to allow for some movement. It stays in place when I need it too, and while it is a bit difficult to clean, it's a great overall mat for my needs. I liked it enough I bought a second one when we returned to the office!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in 10 sizes and in eight styles). This cordless mouse is recommended for small- to medium-sized hands — if you have large hands, Logitech recommends the MX vertical mouse ! Get a closer look at this mouse on TikTok , where the reviewer talks about how much more comfortable they find using it compared to a traditional mouse. Promising reviews : "" I have carpal tunnel so this mouse is a lifesaver. I've been using an ergo mouse for a few years and will NOT go back to the traditional style. This is a wonderful small investment that makes a huge impact on my life! EEEEEK THANK YOOOU."" — Barbie Larrinaga ""This mouse is perfect for smaller hands, or people who have any kind of hand pain . I find this extremely comfortable. The buttons on the mouse are very easy to push, and they’re quiet. If you have any arthritis or discomfort in your hand, this is perfect!"" — Jaye Hockenberry Get it from Amazon for $79.60 (available in three colors and right- and left-handed styles). Promising review : ""Thank goodness I came across these mats! Lifesaver when it comes to my mouse falling off of the small mouse pad. Nice and comfy for my small computer table. Just what I needed. A MUST have."" — Regina Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in 17 colors and five sizes). Promising reviews: ""This has been a lifesaver for my eyes !"" — Robin OConnor ""I love this product. I always buy one when I move into a new office. It’s basic, but it works. Clip adheres very well to my computer monitor when both surfaces are clean and dry. Use some rubbing alcohol to clean both services before trying to adhere it. I like this document clip because it helps me be more productive. I also use it to hold papers that need my immediate attention if I am not doing data entry. In summary, I’ve purchased this product many times for a reason. It does the job with no frills and it’s a great value!"" — Cassidy Get it from Amazon for $12.27 . I've had this cooling pad since 2018, though I mainly use it with my personal laptop when I'm playing PC games. The pad itself is super quiet and not distracting, and it does a fantastic job of actively cooling down my now-older laptop while it's working hard to run games, so I can vouch for its effectiveness. It's also *fantastic* to use while you're working with your laptop on the couch, keeping your legs away from the heat without feeling bulky or heavy. If you're using a MacBook, be sure to pick up a USB-C hub to connect this (I've used this one for years and like it!). Promising review: ""My MacBook Pro has been a nightmare to work on this summer. After working for about 4 hours, the keyboard is jumpy. Loading tabs, websites, and programs take forever because it heats up as the day progresses . I realized the heat was mostly the issue after placing ice packs and frozen peas under the laptop to cool it down. I purchased this cooling pad, and the difference is amazing! No more frozen peas! It is running like new again. Whoop!! Lifesaver , I am sure that the laptop is a lot happier too. :)"" — Liz Get it from Amazon for $27.99+ (available in three colors). Reviewers suggest turning the heat down from high to medium once the drink gets down to about the halfway point so it stays a comfortable temperature! I can vouch for this mug warmer: It not only looks good, but works great for keeping my coffee warm all day long (because yes, I'm one of those people that'll sip on coffee until 5 p.m., all right!!). I was kind of worried it'd be too small for some of my larger mugs, but the center plate is bigger than expected and accommodated every mug in my (very eclectic) collection perfectly. I can confirm that flat-bottomed mugs are the best option for use with this warmer as they do stay hotter, but it still keeps my concave-bottom mugs warm enough for my taste. Also, I looove how sleek the white version looks on my white desk, and the auto-shutoff function is a nice safety feature as an absent-minded person. Promising review : ""This product is part of my answer to coffee or tea which goes forgotten while I get smacked with a call or Zoom or projects or scheduling, which always seems to happen just as I'm pouring a hot cup. A lifesaver, especially for working from home ."" — E. Johnson Get it from Amazon for $21.74+ (available in nine styles). Remember to also stand up every hour or so to give yourself a break from sitting! And the brand recommends acclimating yourself to it slowly since you'll be using different muscles in a kneeling chair than you normally would in your traditional office chair. Promising review: "" This chair was a lifesaver . I work from home and spend most of my day at a desk, I was having some pretty decent lower back pain from my chair and noticed my posture suffering. I started looking for a better option and found this chair. It took about a week to get used to and for my core muscles to adjust but even during that time I noticed it was more muscle soreness as opposed to spinal pain. Now I absolutely love it!"" — C & J Get it from Amazon for $99.99 (available in three colors). Each of the attachments has a sticky film that's strong enough to adhere to your monitor, but easy enough to remove that it won't damage it. Promising reviews: ""This product is a lifesaver if you need lots of reminders . I love it."" — Linda Joy Rumph ""I have 568 stickies on any given day and this is exactly what I needed to keep myself organized. It came packaged nicely, no cracks or scratches, and was easy to adhere to. The adhesive is awesome. It's not going anywhere!!! I recommend this to anyone like me who needs a cool place for their notes. You will be the envy of your coworkers!"" — Mason's Mom Get it from Amazon for $5.97+ . Each folder can hold up to 25 sheets and the whole thing can be collapsed and secured with the attached cord for easy transport — which is *so* convenient if you're working a hybrid office-WFH schedule. It even comes with blank stickers for labeling the tabs. (Check out our Smead wall organizer deep dive for more deets on how helpful it is!) Promising review: ""Wow! What an absolute lifesaver! This wall organizer is perfect in my very limited office space! I bought it because I don't have much room and I hate an unorganized office which was beginning to happen. I found this and thought it was adorable (I love the colors). I hung it on my wall, filled it with papers, looks great, and saves a lot of desk space! I think I'm going to buy a couple more! LOVE IT!"" — Kari Get it from Amazon for $8.51+ (available in four colors). BuzzFeed Shopping editor Kayla Boyd loves her floating bookshelves: ""They save a lot of space and since I colorized them, they look like fun decor in my room. It definitely helps me get excited about reading more since they're so cute and visible. The shelves were also super easy to hang and they're very sturdy."" Promising review: "" Sturdy, easy to install, and a lifesaver. I am one of those folks with object permanence issues — if I can't see it, I'm liable to forget it's there, so it helps me to have things out where I can see them. These shelves are easy to install, look cool, and clear up so much desk space while I'm working on several articles or research projects at once. Yeah, the large shelves are a bit too big for most covers to catch and create the invisible/floating effect, but that doesn't bother me. The hardware that came with the shelves worked well on my plaster walls — just needed a drill, a pencil, and a level."" — Sara Potter Get them from Amazon for $21.51+ (available individually or in a set of three, and two colors). Promising review: ""I love this so much. The only part that was difficult was cutting it correctly. Besides that, this is amazing. I live in a townhouse so there’s literally zero privacy as soon as I open my blinds. Not anymore! I work from home, so I’m home all the time and this is a lifesaver. Also, I’m no longer the naked window neighbor! LMFAO! I need more of this stuff ASAP!"" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in 14 sizes and four colors). Great Useful Stuff is a small biz based in Salt Lake City, Utah. Promising reviews: ""Awesome product! I was looking for a way to keep all our tech stuff off my kitchen counter, this was it! It has been a lifesaver — keeps our items charged and in one spot!"" — Amazon Customer ""It is so simple. It required no setup and the magnets that hold the bottom compartment on are strong. I literally did zero work for this product to help me out so much in my everyday life. It clears up my desk clutter and charges my electronics. Plus, it looks and feels quality for the price without paying a huge amount for such a simple concept. I use an iPad air, an iPhone 6s, and an iPhone 7. Because I work from home, my work and personal electronics have to mix but stay organized. This holds them all."" — Rachel R Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in three colors and with or without USB ports). The shelves come in two separate parts that can be arranged close together or spread further apart, depending on what you need! Some reviewers even picked up several of these to build a bigger shelving unit on their desk [pictured above right]. Promising reviews: ""This organizer is a lifesaver . Made my desk less cluttered looking and works great!"" — Elizabeth ""Absolutely love this shelving. I’ve been working from home since the pandemic hit and I went from a huge office to a nook in the corner of our sitting room with no shelving or filing cabinets. The clutter on my desk was driving me nuts. Finally found what I was looking for: a place for my little knickknacks and pictures and my notepads/mail/important papers. Building it was pretty easy, although I did need to turn a piece around, but took less than 15 to put together. Makes my organizing heart happy."" — bdeleone Get them from Amazon for $25.99 (available in six colors). Promising review: ""I sit at a desk all day and this saves my life every day at work ! All my co-workers ask to borrow it. The heat and the moving massage balls feel so amazing!

This compact, rolling desk bike is also height adjustable so you can get your perfect fit with the tray, and has ""whisper quiet"" pedaling, eight resistance levels, and a way to track your mileage, rpm, and other stats. Psst — you can watch the viral desk bike TikTok featuring it for more insight on how it works. Promising review: "" I honestly want to rip the seat off and put it on my own bicycle because of how comfortable it is . It's a plushy seat that adds tons of comfort and support. I LOVE how easy and self-explanatory the bike is, as well as PORTABLE. The wheels make it super easy to move. The desk is a dream come true — nice and spacious and I love the plushy armrest that sits along the edge. If I could give this product 100 STARS I would! For the amount of HOURS I am sitting down at a computer a day, this has been an absolute LIFESAVER and I highly recommend this to anyone wishing they could not only be more active, but who wishes to have better posture while working at their computer."" — Alexa Chalnick Get it from Amazon for $599.99 (available in six styles). Promising reviews: ""I love them! Super lightweight on my face and help so much with glare! I would get migraines all the time but these glasses are a lifesaver! "" — Allie Bouziga ""I honestly can't say enough great things about these glasses. They are cute and for an unbeatable price. The anti-glare isn't bad and they are thick and feel sturdy. Very comfortable to wear and definitely help during the day when you are sitting on the computer and want to give your eyes a rest. I used to get terrible headaches and dry eyes from sitting in front of the computer all day for long hours and this has significantly reduced that. I no longer get headaches as much and my eyes don't feel nearly as dry because I'm not straining them as much."" — Jessica Kravitz Get a set of two from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in 16 color combos).

I use it for carrying my ponytail holders, bobby pins, etc. in my purse. I totally heart it."" — Pudingal1 Get it from Amazon for $4.95 . You deal all the cards out to your two to four players, and everyone keeps their mini-deck facedown. Everyone takes a turn putting a card down in the middle of the table, saying one of the words ""taco,"" ""cat,"" ""goat,"" ""cheese,"" and ""pizza,"" in that order. If the picture on your card matches the word that's said, everyone slaps their hand on the card in a pile as quickly as possible. The last person on the pile has to take the stack and add 'em to their cards, and whoever runs out of cards first wins! Promising review: ""We love Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza original game , so I am so happy that now I can bring this with us to the beach! My kids have already put these in our pool and have been 'diving' for them. It's not exactly how you play the game at all, but they think it is fun! Also, the little outfits for the characters are adorable. I was skeptical about the travel clip at first, but the circle shape makes it much easier to get the cards on/off."" — Timothy M. Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Promising review: ""I didn't know what to expect from this super adorable anxiety bookshelf, but it delivered! I shake it up when I feel anxiety, even frustration, and I sort all the little books back onto the shelves any way I want, and it is sooo satisfying ! The bookshelf is super cute and well-built. It is sturdy and beautiful. The tiny books are detailed, and their covers are amazing. They aren't actual books, but they really look like they are. This is the most gratifying gift I have ever purchased for myself. Beyond satisfied! "" — Elda M Ferguson Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in brown or white). KAF Home is a small business!

The straps fit over your shoulder nicely so they are easy to carry."" — Susan Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in seven styles). Promising review : ""I was amazed how real this looks, even side by side with the real thing. Of course, when you turn it over, you can see the compartment, and you will have to add weight if you want it to feel real, but just sitting in the pantry, it looks real!"" — Brenda Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in nine styles). Promising review: ""Santa left this under the tree for my 9-year-old son, and he LOVES it! So easy to use and takes only a few tries to figure out the boomerang effect!

Lasts long enough to give you breaks!!"" — Kerri "" My teenager loved getting this as a stocking stuffer . It's easy to figure out, durable, and won't give anyone a concussion if you get hit with it.

Promising review: ""Never have I ever been obsessed with a lip balm until Summer Fridays. Love the color, love the applicator, love the scent!

Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in 10 flavors). Promising review: "" This item is the most convenient. It is perfect for someone who does not like to carry around a purse all the time.

It's great for layering or wearing on its own."" — Averie Get it from Amazon for $14.45 (available in white or yellow gold and nine styles)/ If you're wondering *how* these compare, the one on the left is similar to a diamond tennis bracelet (which you can nab from TONS of places), and the middle and right-hand ones bear a striking resemblance to Cartier's $8,000 ""Juste Un Clou"" and the $6,000 ""Love Bracelet."" Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bracelet set! The pieces are delicate yet sturdy, and they can be worn together or separately for different looks.

I'm sooo happy with this. It's a little tight on my finger but I just wear it a little higher where it isn't uncomfortable. It was very easy to set up for my Android device.

I've tried many (and I mean, MANY) water bottles in my time as a shopping editor and I may just go out on a limb here and say this is the best one. I adore my Stanley tumbler, and my BruMate is lovely, but this Owala bottle is such a game-changer. I love the 24-ounce size (not too big, not too small), and the dual spout is UNREAL. I barely know how to describe it except that it's a very smooth drinking experience, and the color options are so fun! I'm definitely a convert and will be using one of these, dare I say, for life. Promising review: ""I have six of them and absolutely LOVE them! The design is amazing, and the colors are stunning! I have recommended them to my friends and even gave some as presents.

Promising review: ""I also ordered one of those book lights that you have to clip directly onto your book. I haven't even tried the clip-on yet because I LOVE THIS ONE SO MUCH!! It's so versatile. It is the perfect solution for when I'm up in the middle of the night and I still want to stay in bed and read while my husband sleeps next to me. Even when I don't have to worry about disturbing someone, this light is still my go-to when reading. It's better than any nightstand lamp because you can focus this light directly on your book or other types of hands-on projects. I had worried that it would be uncomfortable around my neck ,but it's so lightweight I hardly even notice it."" — Linda Holloway Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in eight styles).

They are an affordable pair of pickleball paddles that I have used for almost a year. Having a pair of paddles makes it easy to play with friends and makes this set a great value for the price.

It smells absolutely divine and I can't wait to try out more of their scents. Promising review: ""Gorgeous scent! I love perfumes, and I’m super picky. I either love or return. This scent is gorgeous. Smells a bit sweet but not overly sweet, not super vanilla, just a hint of it with sophistication. Very soft and sultry. I applied moisturizer (thin, thin layer of Vaseline) and then sprayed perfume. It stayed on my skin for probably over eight hours. I checked my sweater the next day, you could easily smell it on my sweater. Definitely worth the money."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29+ (available in two sizes).

BuzzFeed Staff After the Karate Kid actor purportedly insisted that “he did not do anything wrong,” Alicia reportedly found an on-site officer who confirmed that she had a “noticeable bite mark on her arm that was already turning blue and bruising.” The officer reportedly questioned Martin after seeing the bite mark, after which the actor allegedly “admitted to biting” Alicia “out of jest.” The file alleges, “He thought he was being funny, and they play fight all the time on the set of Cobra Kai, and he did not think it was a big deal.” Alicia allegedly made it known that Martin “had legitimately caused her pain.” Reacting to the report online, several internet users were incredibly concerned for Alicia. “this is not okay like what???” one user replied to Variety’s tweet about the incident. “Everything about this is crazy,” another person said . “Martin Kove (Sensei Kreese) just completely destroyed and ruined his reputation,” one user tweeted . Someone else wrote on Reddit , “What a strange thing to do. ‘Play fight’? Like it would be one thing if they mimed karate moves at one another, since it's a fucking karate show, but actually biting someone? What the hell?”",2025-06-24T17:14:58.463455+00:00

Anything anyone threw at me. It was a difficult time. I needed rebooting.” BuzzFeed Staff After eight years of intense legal fighting, Brad and Angelina’s divorce battle finally concluded in late December last year. Discussing the need to “renovate” himself, he added: “You strip down to the foundation and break out the mortar… For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street.” The trio got into an honest conversation about what it’s like to join AA and talk honestly about your experiences when you’re someone as famous as Brad. Interestingly, the Oscar-winner called AA an “amazing thing” and said he felt “quite at ease” being vulnerable. Brad also said he had a similar “desperate” approach when talking to a therapist about his personal struggles, saying: “When I jumped into therapy then, I was just like, ‘Blah, blah, blah, and I did this and I did that and da da da da.’”",2025-06-24T17:14:58.613333+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff Before he was running the show behind the camera, Deepak Kumar Mishra was cracking everyone up online as the guy who nailed a spoof of Raghu Ram. Who would've thought the Rowdies guy would go on to make one of India’s most loved web series? Panchayat was originally going to be called SDO Saheb, because the story was based on a Sub-Divisional Officer. But since the Panchayat office kinda became the star of the show, they went with the much simpler—and catchier— Panchayat . Composer Anurag Saikia wanted something that felt emotional without actual words, so he made up lyrics inspired by Assamese chants for the track “Hiya Tho.” It sounds deep, but it’s actually just beautiful nonsense. And it works. Like his character, Jitendra is an IIT grad who left the corporate life to chase his passion. Thankfully, instead of running a Panchayat office, he landed in front of a camera. Before becoming Sachiv Ji, Jitendra Kumar faced a major blow when he was rejected by both the National School of Drama and FTII, despite his passion for acting and a diploma in engineering But that wasn't the only twist. At one point, he even considered switching lanes and entering rural politics before fully committing to his acting career. Talk about a plot twist worthy of Panchayat itself! Chandan Roy originally came in for a minor part. But he nailed his audition so hard that the makers were like “OK yeah, let’s make him central to the plot.” Enter Vikas, the MVP of quiet chaos. With over 28 million viewers (yep, you read that right), Panchayat season 3 became the second most-watched series in India in 2024, according to the Ormax Media Report. And guess what? It’s still chilling in the top 3. Not bad for a show where the biggest twist is usually someone stealing an election or a water tank. At the 2024 International Film Festival of India (IFFI), Panchayat was crowned Best Indian Web Series. For a show that’s kept things simple (and sincerely funny) since day one, this win isn’t just a pat on the back. It’s a huge moment for Indian OTT content finally getting the serious recognition it deserves. For Season 2, writer Chandan Kumar wanted the real inside scoop of how village panchayats actually function. So, he rang up a bunch of local leaders—inlcuding an ex-mukhiya from North Bihar. But instead of talking about governance or issues, the guy went off script and just trashed his opposition. Method research? More like live drama. Yep, before becoming Abhishek Tripathi, he spent time in Mahodiya village, chilling with local officials, soaking in the everyday chaos, and watching real panchayat meetings go down. No wonder he nailed the confused city guy–turned–reluctant secretary vibe so well. Those cozy Republic Day scenes in Panchayat Season 1? Total illusion. The cast was sweating it out in shawls and sweaters while filming in a brutal 45–47°C. There were no air conditioners, no fancy setups, just peak summer, and a lot of patience.",2025-06-24T17:14:58.938807+00:00

Intimate Rose is a small biz creating wellness products, like dilators, weights, supplements, and more that help treat issues and pain related to the pelvic floor. Promising review: ""Since starting, my bladder control has significantly improved. I am now able to sneeze or cough without peeing myself. Yes, that's right. I am able to hold my pee longer, which means I can actually make it to the bathroom without dribbling on myself. The best part is that just a few short weeks into the program you will have results you can feel. I think every woman who has ever had kids should try this out. The overall quality of my life has improved. Ditch your panty liners, stop the embarrassing dribbles, and no more mad dashes to the restroom because of a weak bladder. Even my sex life has improved; I have control of those pelvic muscles now. Just remember to wash the weights before and after each use with an antibacterial spray, and allow time to air dry before putting them away. I say air dry because if you wipe them dry with a cloth you run the risk of giving yourself a bladder infection or urinary tract infection, and those are no laughing matter.

Long story short, I got these medicated Band-Aids and the results are incredibly satisfying. Used these Band-Aids every day for a week and the next week, my wart is gone.

One cycle with this stuff, 15 minutes, and the results are amazing! The first photo (above) is with my tub running with the solution. Then I drained it (second photo) and wiped it down with a sponge.

The set includes five fabric pants button extenders, five fabric hook-and-eye extenders, and three denim jeans waist extenders in a variety of colors. Promising review: ""Why didn't I get these sooner? These work perfectly! You have all of those pants that used to fit great, until a few years ago — you know, the ones in the back of your closet that you will wear again 'as soon as you lose a few pounds.' These extenders look simple enough but you think that they won't work or will show. The good news is, they never show once you put your belt on and, in my case, I've now got five pairs of chinos, three pairs of dress wool pants, and three pair of jeans now back into my rotation! Buy these!"" — JCI Get a multipack from Amazon for $7.99 . If you suspect you have tonsil stones (also called tonsilloliths), talk to your dentist or doctor so they can perform a physical exam or imaging scan and deliver a diagnosis. Promising review: ""I'm in my early 30s and just started getting tonsil stones. Until a few months ago, I never even knew what these things were! Anyway, I've been struggling with cotton buds to fully remove the stones, but I couldn't get rid of them, and they would just come back within the week. I received this and OMFG...best investment ever. No struggle holding my phone as a flashlight while awkwardly poking myself in front of my badly lit bathroom mirror. I sat comfortably at my vanity, used one hand, and removed the whole stone in less than a minute. Why did I not know this was a thing? Why have I been struggling? Get it! Stop struggling, suffering, and awkwardly dealing with this ridiculous condition...trust me."" — Wren Get it from Amazon for $8.94+ (available in two colors and a multipack).

I love giving them as gifts!!!"" — AML Get it from Amazon for $4.97+ (available in six sizes). Promising review: ""I am one of those women who just hates those thick pads. I tried others that claimed good protection but found out very soon that they leaked. I want to know that I am protected from embarrassing situations. I am an older woman with urinary incontinence. It's bad enough being old and having all the problems old people go through, but add urine leakage and bad urine odor, and you see others turn away from you. These pads are exactly what I like. They are thin and fit comfortably, and you don't smell like you got a diaper on; no leaks and no discomfort.

Community Contributor She came in cool, confident, and immediately had guys second-guessing their connections. She was the kind of bombshell who changed the vibe just by being there. Kat didn’t cause drama on purpose, but her entrance had the villa’s energy shifting instantly. She gave sweet bombshell energy, but left everyone questioning their ""secure"" couples. Kenny's impact was instant: one look at Jana and she already saw her whole future ahead of her. No scheming, just pure bombshell charm. Isaiah reminded us that male bombshells can bring the drama too. His entrance had triangles forming and loyalties tested in minutes. He was never there to play it safe! Mercedes gave us textbook iconic bombshell behavior. His chemistry with each islander detonated the most shocking recoupling of the season, IYKYK. Grace didn’t just enter; she owned the villa from the second she stepped in. Nobody was safe once Grace arrived, and the shake-up was immediate. Maura redefined bombshell energy. From bold moves to fierce one-liners , she kept the villa (and us) on our toes 24/7. She bombshelled so hard that the producers made her the host of Love Island Games . Our newest bombshell on the list is Andreina. She came in wanting to stir the pot, and I have a feeling that is exactly what she will do... Okay, yes, I know Zeta may have been an OG, but she radiated bombshell energy. She commanded the villa with grace, emotional intelligence, and star power. Miguel was the bombshell blueprint. Charismatic, funny, and dangerously good at making connections, Miguel had couples crumbling within hours. The villa reset the moment he arrived. He's set the standard for male bombshells that's yet to be matched.",2025-06-24T17:14:59.504757+00:00

Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Some even call these steam cleaners the best purchase they've ever made. Contributor, HuffPost Using steam also allows you to clean with just water, a gentler alternative to harsh chemical cleaners . Steam cleaning can work on tons of surfaces, from tile to stoves, windows and even sealed hardwood floors. Rating: 4.2 out of 5 stars We've previously covered this Steamify handheld option, and our readers have responded with enthusiasm. The steamer can heat up to 230 degrees in three to five minutes and has a 350-milliliter tank, able to produce continuous pressurized steam for seven to 15 minutes. The 12-piece accsesory kit includes a few different nozzles for cleaning windows, doors, corners and even steaming fabric. There's a 9.8-foot power cord. Promising review: ""I recently purchased this steam cleaner for my bathroom, and I’m beyond impressed. It’s incredibly durable, with a sturdy build that feels like it will last for years. The steam output is powerful and consistent, making deep cleaning effortless. It’s also a huge time-saver, cutting my cleaning time in half. I’ve had no issues with leakage, and the speed at which it heats up and gets the job done is outstanding. Overall, it’s an excellent investment for anyone looking for efficiency and reliability in their cleaning routine."" — Rokan Price: $55.89 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars Shark's Steam & Scrub mop is set apart by its rotating pads and and focused “steam blaster” spray, which work together to provide powerful steam and 150 scrubs per minute to remove stains. The mop has three steam modes for different mess levels, a touch-button operation and LED headlights so you can see and tackle all of the dirt and debris. Promising review: ""This product is truly a god send. I have referred so many people to this product just by word of mouth. I can have my entire house mopped within 15 minutes and I have a total of 4 pads that are machine washable (game changer). When I was pregnant, I was able to still mop with ease, submitting little to no effort. If you have a little (or a messy spouse) this is your sign- you NEED."" — Katie N Price: $199.95 Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars With 4.3 stars across over 42,000 reviews, McCulloch's deluxe canister steam cleaner has a two-hour runtime and a 64-ounce tank. The 18-foot power cord, 7-foot hose, wheels and retractable handle make it easy to move the tank around as needed. In addition to flooring, tile, grills and more, the steamer is great for personal car detailing, with tons of brushes, a scraper, mop pads and a squeegee. If you're looking for a more heavy-duty option, this could be the one for you. Promising review: ""Put off buying one of these for a while (2-3 yrs). I’m glad I finally but the bullet!! This is awesome! Took me 15 minutes to deep clean my stove, normally can take well over 45 minutes due to me completing taking it apart. Also got ALL the hard water stains off my windows in minutes WITHOUT me scrubbing! I normally have to get an SOS pad and vinegar. NOT THIS TIME! 3 swipes and I was done with a 4’ x 6’ window! Cord is about as long as a normal vacuum so it doesn’t bother me at all."" — Coral M. Watkins Price: $192 Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars If you like the look and quality of that McCulloch steamer but don't need something so large or with so many accessories, the handheld version of their steam cleaner could be a good alternative. The steamer is much smaller, with just a 6-ounce tank that can run for up to 10 minutes at a time, but there are plenty of other features to like: The handle has a lockable trigger, plus there's a 34-inch extension hose and 10 other accessories like brushes, nozzles and more. The power cord is 15 feet, so you can get into hard-to-reach spots. Promising review: ""We have a 1960s model stove. I've been battling these stains on here for over 14yrs. I've tried every spray and scrubber known to man. I finally decided to purchase this and see what happens. I could cry y'all. She almost looks like new again. I'm so happy with how well it worked."" — Ashley m Price: $66.90 Rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars A rectangular mop head can pose a challenge when it comes to small spaces or unique layouts. That's not an issue with this Steam & Go mop , which has a triangular pointed head to eliminate that issue. The mop has a 10-in-1 design and a detachable handle, so you can use it as a handheld too, with different nozzles, pads and brushes. This steam mop can also be used with cleaning solution if you desire, unlike many others — there's a dual tank system to separate water and cleaning solution. Promising review: ""The floor in my apartment is vinyl with grooves in it which makes it very hard to clean. This steamer works perfectly and best of all it can be hand held. It has a number of attachments, an extra cleaning pad and a longer cord. I like the triangular head for getting into corners."" — Kathleen B. Price: $79.99 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars This steam mop heats up to 230 degrees and is a ""game-changer"" that has one reviewer 's floors ""living their best life."" There are three levels of adjustable steam, so you can get the right amount of power for your cleaning need or floor type. The tank holds 15.2 ounces and the power cord is 23 feet long. This mop has a self-standing design for easy storage, and an adjustable height so you won't strain your back or shoulders when using it. Promising review: ""So far, I am very pleased with my steamer. I have all tile floors, and it works like a dream on them. The steamer is very light weight, heats in no time, slides nicely over the tiles, even the porcelain ones that have a little rougher surface. It sure beats sleping a bucket and mop around and it saves my shoulders from aching afterwards."" — M. Allen Price: $89.99 Rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars Another option with a triangular mop head, this 5-in-1 steam mop can be used as a handheld or standing up. The 400-milliliter tank has four modes and can be heated up in as little as 30 seconds. This comes with 11 accessories, including a few cleaning cloths, window cleaning tools, brushes and nozzles. Promising review: ""This is one of the most amazing tools I have ever used. It was extremely well packaged and arrived in perfect condition. Quality components, especially power cord (which is nice and long) and attachments. Super light weight. I could not believe the cleaning power. I started with the grout in my bathroom and was instantly impressed. Continued to the shower where it got mildew from cracks and crevasses with almost zero effort, even the plastic track piece that holds the shower doors at the bottom. It got the space behind my toilet that I can never reach because there is so little room. Used it on the seal of my front loader washing machine and it immediately got rid of the musty smell. Used it on my sink drains and it got rid of the odor there. I am so over the top happy with this product. Highly recommend."" — alisha mckenzie Price: $169.95 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars Multiple reviews call this Waitbird steamer a ""workhorse"" with ""outstanding cleaning power."" It can heat up to 248 degrees and comes with a whopping 21 accessories for multiple uses. The 38-ounce tank provides up to 45 minutes of continuous steam and only takes five minutes to heat up. You can adjust the amount of steam and also toggle between manual and automatic mode to control the steam flow. Promising review: ""The best purchase I made ever! We moved into our house 2 years ago and have cleaned it pretty well but we have never DEEP clean it like how this steamer did. It was was so easy to use and removed the toughest build up. And a bonus is it is very easy to store away as well. We love it and recommend it to all homeowners!"" — Todd Tolley Price: $99.99+ (available in two colors) Rating: 4.3 out of 5 stars This mop has 10 accessories and a 10-ounce water tank, plus a 23-foot cord. Multiple reviews mention that the value is great for the price you pay . The head can rotate 120 degrees left to right, and 90 degrees front to back to get into tough spots, and the three cleaning modes can help you tackle daily cleaning as well as more stubborn stains. Promising review: ""I just love this steam mop!! I used it to clean the tile floor in my bathroom. It has cleaned the floor with out me having to do spot cleaning manually. It is so quick to clean. No going over it several times to get great results. I will be using this steam mop everywhere. It cut down on my cleaning time greatly. There is a sense of cleaest it can be now when I enter in the room not the best I could do."" — Sandra Robinson Price: $89.99 Rating: 4.4 out of 5 stars This canister cleaner can hold 48 ounces of water at a time for up to 45 minutes of continuous steam, though the lockable trigger helps you conserve water so it's directed where and when you need it. The 15-foot power cord and 6.5-foot hose give this thing serious reach, and the 15 accessories include handy attachments like mop pads, brushes, a squeegee and more for different cleaning needs. A bunch of reviewers were inspired to leave this machine long , multi-paragraph 5-star reviews , in case that tells you how beloved this is. Promising review: ""This unit puts out HOT steam. I've tried another steamer and found the steam to not be nearly as hot as this one. I have steamed tile, wood floors, base boards and cabinets with this machine and have been very pleased with the results. It has a trigger on the wand/nozzle which is extremely useful. I had another steamer where the only control was on the water unit, not the nozzle, which was really a pain. Lots of attachments that reach up high - handy for tile walls in the shower. I've been steaming everything that doesn't run away from me! Overall, I'm very happy with this purchase."" — DH Price: $119.99 Rating: 4.1 out of 5 stars Another large canister option, this steamer can hold 51 ounces of water and even has a red LED light to let you know when it needs a refill (which will typically be about 30 to 45 minutes after you turn it on). Reviews vouch for its effectiveness in killing bed bugs and insects as well as steaming fabric and whole-house cleaning, earning it ""10 stars"" in one reviewer's estimation . This one also has a child safety lock, if you're concerned about a little one getting near it. It heats up to 226 degrees and has 19 accessories, including two extension tubes for the 10-foot cord. Promising review: ""This is,an excellent steam cleaner! I would recommend this over the lower priced ($30 to $40) range cleaners and the high priced ones that cost a few hundred dollars. This steam cleaner has a large container so it creates steam for more than 45 minutes. The steam is very hot and powerful so it makes cleaning a snap. I especially loved the metal scrub brushes- they got rid of all the sticky stuff on my kitchen gas hood (that no chemical cleaner could even budge) and the tile floor. I hope they sell those as extras. I love everything about this little machine and not to mention that it is safe, effective, efficient and performs better than any chemical cleaner. Also saves a lit of time, money and manpower and makes everything smell super clean. Last but not least it cleans everything well - windows, stainless steel appliances, tile, ceramic, shower, toilets and bathtubs."" — Ak2474 Price: $107.98+ (available in three colors) Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:14:59.677830+00:00

Promising review: ""I pretty much love everything about this romper. I ordered the dark green, but I want it in every color! It is super comfortable. Even right out of the package, it wasn't very wrinkled. The material wasn't too thick or thin. I wore it in summer with sandals, but I think you could easily add a sweater/tights/boots for a cute fall look. It was easy to get on/off in the bathroom (one small button at the back of the neck)... And, best of all, it has pockets!!!"" — Jessica K. Price: $23.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and 17 colors) Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bracelet set! The pieces are delicate yet sturdy, and they can be worn together or separately for different looks. The design is simple but elegant, making it perfect for both casual and formal occasions. They’re also really comfortable to wear all day. Definitely worth the price!"" — Brandy Gay Price : $18.99 for a set of three (also available in sets of two) Promising review : ""I normally don’t love lip products. I have small lips and I am never really satisfied! But this stuff is sooooo good! You don’t even understand how moisturizing and glossy this is. It’s not sticky, very pigmented, and the stain it leaves behind is gorgeous! I got the Rosie one, and it's chef's kiss perfect! I’m totally getting more!"" — Katherine Stanton Price: $11.97 (available in 12 shades) Promising review: ""The hype off TikTok is real about this scent. It’s very warm and vanilla-smelling. Almost like a beachy vibe. I hate how no one would give me any kind of explanation on how it smelled, but glad I jumped on the bandwagon with this one."" — Karli Bullins Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in 11 other scents). It even comes with eight extra brush heads AND a travel case! Promising review: ""I'm now at over three years with this toothbrush and it still looks and works like new. I use it in the shower, rinse it under water after every use, and use it two to three times a day. The only thing that is maybe suffering at this point is the battery (lasts about 1.5 weeks now), but I also only charge it when the red charging light comes on. If you leave it on the charger stand daily, this may never be an issue for you. This is truly a great product for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone. I had originally felt that if it lasted as long as my Sonicare, it would save me some money, but at this point, it has surpassed my Sonicare by 2+ years for a fraction of the price! "" — Jesse Price: $39.95 Promising review: ""Very glam in a '50s starlet way, a real bikini feel without being super exposed. I hate swimsuits, and this is the first one I've worn in about 10 years. I felt confident in it and really enjoyed myself at the weekend getaway. The little cutout makes it sexy to wear with a sarong or wrap for when you need to take a break from the poolside."" — Ms. Willows Price : $36.99+ (available in sizes XS–22 Plus, and 27 colors). Reviewers mention that if you're between sizes, size up! Promising review: ""This suit is so pretty! I was nervous that for the price, it would be poor quality, but it looks just like the photos. The material is nice and thick, and I love that it’s padded. I’m between a small and medium, so I sized up based on other reviews."" — Morgan Meldrum Price : $35.99 (available in sizes 2–14 and in eight styles). Promising review: ""This product is witchcraft. My nails have always been brittle, flaky, and super prone to just breaking. Because of all that, I had the nasty habit of biting them. I didn’t take before or after but the image with no polish is just three days of use. My nails have been growing like [wild] since then and are stronger than ever in my life. The image with polish is about a month of use (once a day). Also, it helped me to stop biting my nails. I can now do my own nails and shape them the way I want. Never in my life did I think I’d have nails I could shape myself. I don’t leave a lot of reviews, but trust me when I say this product is worth the hype. I’m definitely a returning customer."" — Andrea Price: $9.99+ (available in three sizes and packs of two). This travel tumbler is insulated — so your hot or cold drinks will actually stay that way for hours! Promising review : ""I bought the 12-ounce, and let me tell you! This is by far the best travel mug I’ve EVER bought. Super leakproof (and I shove it into my tote bag and duffel bag). Super durable. Great material, and the sip? Super smooth. No slurping because it allows air to flow out and in while drinking . Such a great mug. Worth every damn penny. Highly recommend. P.S. — hot stuff stays super hot for a long time."" — Lindsay Panataleon Price: $24.98+ (available in two sizes and seven colors) Promising review: "" I purchased these originally in May 2020, and I finally bought a second pair in April 2022. I chose these two years ago to help with the foot/knee/back pain I was having while walking on the hard concrete floors of my lab. They soon became my all-day, everyday shoes: at work, at home, and outside. The fabric upper is slightly stretchy, making it feel like the shoe is hugging your foot without binding. I have a large bunio,n and these are the only shoes I’ve worn that don’t put pressure on it or have a seam in that area that causes pain. These sneakers have been through hundreds of hours of walking, along with yard work and hiking. I have machine-washed them countless times (not recently, lol), and they’ve held up without fraying or shrinking. The fabric comes completely clean from the red clay we have here in the south, along with stains from oil and chicken poop (don’t ask)."" — Lauren C Price: $36.48+ (available in sizes women's 5–13, in two widths, and 10 colors). Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products. This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (seriously where was this on my last hiking trip?) Promising review: ""I bought this because I saw it on TikTok, and have been having issues with mosquito bites. Used it a few times to relieve itchiness and I am convinced it works! Have been recommending it to my family and friends. Read the directions and follow them carefully. Don't use this on your face or neck, or other sensitive areas. Don't do a lot of suction, just a little bit. And do it a few times if needed. Great invention!"" — Joe Price : $9.95 (available in three colors). Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" — Tracey Agopian Price : $9.99 . The shade Cheers to No Smears is featured above on the left, and the shade Fast Foodie is featured on the right. Promising review : ""I just love this nail polish! Love the color and how fast it dries. I will order again."" — Georgie Price: $9.99 (available in 31 shades) Promising review: ""I have a pair of the Aerie crossover flare leggings, and those are worn out, so I decided to purchase another pair because I can’t live without my flares! Y'all, these leggings are the truth!! I have never seen such a great [alternative] for the Aerie ones. They feel like butter soft on your skin and have the same durability and thickness, even the same stitching!! Save your money and get these!!!"" — Jasmine Price : $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XXL, four inseams, and in 27 colors) This set also comes with plastic gloves, a plastic cover, and rubber bands. Promising review: "" Bought these as an activity for teenagers. Dye color is vibrant and beautiful. We first made the designs using the provided directions and rubber bands, then dry dyed the shirts. We left the shirts in bags for 24 hrs and then washed them outside with a hose to not get the ink/dye all over. We then let the shirts dry outside in the sun, then we rinsed and dried them in the washer, then washed and dried them again. Color has stayed beautifully, and kids love the shirts!"" — Ariss M Price: $24.74 Reviewer on the left is wearing the shade Pink Ice , reviewer on the right is wearing the shade Mink Brown . Promising review: ""I bought a couple of these lipsticks some time ago, and I was expecting nothing from them, and they delivered a lot. These lipsticks are very pigmented and creamy. One application will last several hours. They are moisturizing, and they look great on your lips."" — Yise Price: $1.29 (available in 23 shades) Promising review: "" As someone who owns multiple pairs of Birks, these sandals are absolutely up to the expectations of real Birks! The Birks I have are the Arizona soft footbed. I wanted this style of Birks, but I couldn’t find the soft footbed version in them. I saw these and thought I might as well try them for the price. Let me tell you, these are even comfier than my soft-footbed Arizona Birks! Omg, they feel amazing. They are nice and padded! They are so adorable, too! Great quality."" — Lee Price: $29.99 (available in women's sizes 5–12, two widths, and 20 colors) Promising review: "" I recently tried this bra, and it has quickly become one of my favorites! The fit is perfect — true to size with just the right amount of stretch to ensure comfort all day. The straps are adjustable and don’t dig in, even after wearing them for hours. The fabric is soft against the skin, and the breathability is great, so I never feel overheated. The support is amazing without feeling too constrictive. It gives a natural lift and keeps everything in place without any uncomfortable digging or shifting. I also love the design; it's sleek and subtle, making it perfect to wear under a variety of outfits."" — Tzippy M Price: $16.94+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 19 colors) Promising review: ""After trying a bunch of different sports bras and tops, I came across this one . I absolutely love it. It’s super supportive and comfortable. The adjustable straps help make this the perfect fit."" — Perrone Price : $28 (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and seven colors) You can also spray it on all over if you need some quick head-to-toe moisture when you're in a hurry. Promising review: ""I wish I could rate this 100 stars. This stuff is INCREDIBLE... My skin instantly looks and feels hydrated, fresh, glowing, and comfortable. I am already on my third bottle of this; it is wonderful to incorporate into skincare as a first step, in between other products, as a setting/finishing spray for makeup, or throughout the day when your skin needs a little refresher. I wish they'd make a jumbo size of this (like, 10+ oz), because I would douse my entire body in this formula if I could."" — bex–7 Price: $14+ (available in two sizes and a two-pack) Promising review: ""Absolutely have become my favorite pair of sunglasses, and I have many pairs. Very trendy and quite affordable. I am shocked at how durable they are for the price point. My sunglasses take a beating on my head, thrown in my bag, and I usually break them in no time, but these have stood up to my normal wear. They offer solid sun protection but not super dark, which I love. They fit the face very well, not oversized and huge, but just right for me. Love them!"" — NittanyLion Price: $15.99 (available in 10 colors) Promising review: "" Product works just as described! Our kiddos are 3 and 1, and both love to use it. We love that the pen can be attached and that we can lock the screen if we want to. Perfect for at home, car travel, and when we need the kids quiet and entertained."" — Sean C Price: $19.99+ (available in three sizes and five colors) Promising review: ""I'm purchasing my third and fourth sets of these sheets today. One will be a gift for my mom and dad. Over a year later, I've had no issues at all. They continue to wash and fit perfectly and are easily adaptable for weather changes. I add a flannel top sheet or blanket when chilly. Can't be beat for under $20 a set."" — nativepeach Price: $12.99+ (available in seven sizes and 44 colors and patterns) Promising review: "" When I first saw the advertisement for this product, I thought it was too good to be true, so I purchased it to see if it truly worked, and it absolutely did... I have 4c hair and everything I have ever used never worked — my hair would get frizzy or even go back to curly as soon as I stepped outside. I had no frizz, no static, and my hair was SO SOFT and it lasted a week and a half. I LOVE this product."" — Chy Marie Price: $12+ (available in two sizes and two kits) It's also available in an extra strength version and a version for curly hair . If you're looking for a water-based cleanser to go with this one, reviewers love this pore-deep cleansing foam from the same brand for their double-cleansing routine! Promising review: ""My skin is *super* sensitive, but as I've aged (44 years), I feel like my pores have become more visible. I hadn't used an oil cleanser before and wasn't 100% sure how it should all work. The Anua oil cleanser works how we all once hoped Biore pore strips would work back in the day but without any pain or irritation. My skin is combination skin, so I have to be really careful about not drying out the dry spots (and getting eczema) and not over-hydrating the oily spots (and getting a breakout). I rub the oil on my face as the first part of my cleansing routine; I massage it in for ~60 seconds and then put a small amount of water on my fingers and begin rubbing that on my face. The water starts the emulsification process and helps to clean out everything the oil has bonded to/mixed with. Then, I just rinse it clean and use a gentle cleanser afterward. I haven't had any irritation, redness, or fallout from adding this product to my skincare routine. I love it. I am almost through my first bottle and if I go a few days without using the cleanser, my pores become more visible/dirty again. I will definitely keep purchasing the Anua oil cleanser."" — Tassa Price: $17.69 Check out a TikTok of the Monday Dry Shampoo in action. Promising review: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months. It does have a white cast, but that can easily be worked into the hair to become undetectable."" — Meg B. Price : $6.97 Promising review: ""I’ve tried so many nipple covers over the years, and these are just in a league of their own! They stick and don’t move (sweat, clothes, moisturizer, etc. — nothing budges them), but then they peel off so easily. It’s magic. They are completely seamless, and my husband (without prompting) said they looked like a second skin. I’ve got quite 'triangular' boobs, and they completely mold to the shape and look like I just have no nipples lol. Only when I’m suuuuuper cold does any level of nipple start to show through, and even then, it’s minimal. They’re more pricey than others I’ve bought before but so worth it. The others were one and done — these have held up through several wears and are still in perfect condition. Will repurchase them as soon as they wear out, without a doubt! No more bras! "" — Alison BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Price: $26.50+ (available in five shades and two sizes: one that fits cups A–C and one that fits cups D+).

I copied his grandparents' great idea and got one for my grandson and he is equally captivated by it! Get an extra gallon of bubbles to send with it if it is a gift!"" — One Concerned Prof Price : $24.99 Promising review: ""I bought this for all the clear bag ruled events. It worked great to carry all things I deemed necessary: wallet, glasses case, phone, keys, and tissue pack. The price was fair and I liked having a choice of colors. The strap was adjustable for cross body or over the shoulder."" — yosews Price : $7.99+ (available in 20 colors) Psst — lots of reviewers say this fits their Stanley cup *and* the cheaper alternative versions of it, like this $29 Simple Modern tumbler . Promising review : ""Easy to clean. Holds a lot of different snacks. Lightweight. Color is beautiful. Fun to use. Good gift idea."" — Mc Price : $9.99 (available in two sizes and five colors). Promising review: ""Where has this been all my life!! We have one long-haired cat and three dogs — suffice it to say, shedding hair is a big problem on every cloth-like surface in our home. No more vacuuming the couches and chairs like wild when you have this around. This picks up hair quickly and easily when used correctly (fast back-and-forth motion). I will never not have this in our house! "" — Shelby Cipolla Price : $23.99+ (available in three colors). Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic . Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic , you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" — Angela Leonard Price : $11.97. Promising review: ""I am totally obsessed with these lights. I bought my first set and had them for about a week and couldn’t get over how lovely they were. So, I have now purchased two more sets. They light up my flowers and azalea bushes beautifully. They have a lovely orange glow like little fireflies."" — A Lombardo Price: $14.98 (available as a four-, six-, or 10-pack) Promising review: "" I needed to upgrade my summer bag, and I am so glad I came across this one. I was really surprised at how large it was once it arrived. I got the large size, but I think it will work out perfectly. We tested it out on our picnic last weekend and it fit literally EVERYTHING. I was amazed. It fit TWO blankets on top, two lunches, two wine coolers, a wine bottle, a Yeti, snacks, and our books. At first, the price was a shock for me, but after seeing reviews and doing research, it is actually on the cheaper end, and for the quality, it is 100% worth it... Bonus points for the waterproof pocket for phones, keys, etc..."" — Amazon Customer Price: $41.99+ (available in three sizes and 21 colors) It works by plugging into your car's round auxiliary power outlet, so you can literally use it anywhere (I have a similar one and absolutely love it)! Promising review: ""Words cannot describe how much I hate dealing with gas stations — whether it's getting gas, a car wash, or air for my tires, I really hate being at the gas station for any length of time. I live in the Pittsburgh area, so the up-and-down weather wreaks havoc on my tire pressure and I am TRULY GRATEFUL to be able to check my tire pressure and fill them up from the comfort of my home. This device couldn't be easier to use, and the fact that you can lock the nozzle in place and fill the air hands-free is wonderful. I never leave reviews, but chef's kiss on this product. Can't recommend enough."" — Amazon Customer Price: $31.98+ (available in two sizes and four colors) Check out a TikTok of the plug-in fly trap in action. Promising review: ""I can’t say enough wonderful things about these handy little bug catchers! They are simple to use, cheap to refill, and catch a ton of small bugs and flies. I have eight of them now, all around my house! It’s a little gross how many tiny flying insects are around…but it makes me feel a lot better now that I have these!"" — Chris H. Price : $14.97 (available in different pack sizes). I ADORE my Nex Playground. Not only is it great for toddlers (my nieces and nephews spend hours playing little education games), but it's also so fun for adults. There's this Barbie Dance game that I am not ashamed to say I've spent literal hours playing with my husband, mother, and even three year old niece. It's crazy great at tracking people and movements. I only use the remote to turn on the game, but from there all I need to do is use my hand to choose options and start the games. It doesn't matter how tall or tiny the players are, the Nex camera is able to track your movements accurately so adults and children can play alike. Promising review : ""First, as a UX and graphic designer, I love the design of everything about the Nex Playground . Opening it was easy, and setup was understandable and easy for anyone. The onboarding was fun and creative. I wish there were more games in the catalog, but the games available were definitely worth the buy. This is great for apartment living and during the cold winter when your toddlers can't go outside; it solves many sensory issues. Keeping my kids active and keeping me in shape at the same time with a variety of creative activity games is amazing, and it makes for great family game nights. If you are looking for something fun for your kids that keeps them active, this is the buy for you. As a father of two toddlers with autism, I can honestly say this brings me back to when I had an Xbox Connect as a kid and I am happy my kids will be able to experience what I experienced. Looks good with my other systems."" — louis Price : $249 . Promising review: ""After trying these, the pursuit for the most seamless underwear ended with these, and I came to write that on my way to buy a second pack. I worked at VS for three years, what seems like forever ago, and tried every “seamless” thong under the sun- at the store and otherwise- all of which rolled, were still visible, or the liner was not cotton, which just feels gross by the end of a workout or the end of the day. These aren’t that. They DISAPPEAR under all the workout attire. Anti-camel toe… HELLO?!?! They don’t hold sweat. They don’t roll. They don’t move around.  I just had my fourth baby and first C-section a couple of months back, and these are wide enough in the front. What is this panty sorcery? I threw out everything else from anywhere else. Follow the size guide. I washed in warm water upon arrival, even with the red in the pack, and none of the colors bled. I’ve washed 2x, and they look the same as when I first opened the box. They’re wildly comfortable for a thong from someone who despises every thong and even other styles of underwear I’ve ever tried. Picky lady problems, the list went on. Always something wrong with them on my body. NOT THESE! What!?!! I work out in these, run errands, housework ahhhh — they’re my new go-to that I ditched everything else. Comfy, sexy, stretchy, actually so seamless that they don’t exist under clothing, and a fantastic deal… It’s sorcery, I’m convinced ."" — Ebony Price : $24+ (available in women's sizes XS–4X and nine color packs). County Line Kitchen is a small business specializing in mason jar–style cold brew makers, pitchers, and accessories. Promising review: ""This has been a hit in my house. Makes the most delicious cold brew and is of great quality. Has saved a ton of money on going out and on pods I used to buy. I try to let it sit for 48 hours so I can dilute it with a little water to get it to last longer, and throw it in my dishwasher in between uses. Perfect!"" — Jo Price : $24.99+ (available in two sizes and four styles). See what BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has to say about these : TBH, I bought this ring after seeing it blow up on TikTok, and I love it. I wear it every single day, and I've gotten SO many compliments on it — friends are always stunned when I tell them how cheap it is! I've been wearing it for months now without any wear and tear that a quick cleaning won't fix. Pictures don't do it justice; it really does ✨gleam✨ like real jewels. (Bonus: I use this as a fake wedding ring when I travel to encourage humans to leave me alone, lolololol.) Price : $15.95+ (available in three plates and sizes 5–10).

It's been YEARS since I've been able to find a swimsuit that I feel comfortable in. I love how beautiful it is while still being modest. It's very nicely made and very comfortable to wear.

Seems like it's really well made! Also, this braided rope detail is everything! I paired it with different bottoms I had because I wanted a tad more coverage (mom life), but the bottoms it came with were also cute and not too skimpy at all.

Tompkins Get it from Amazon for $26.99 (available in sizes S–XXL and 30 colors). Promising review : ""These shorts are amazing. I thought they would be like similar ones I've had that are short and you have to pull them down from riding up every few steps you take. They are so soft and comfortable, I wanted to wear them around the home, just as shorts. They are nice-fitting, tight, but not too snug to give you any bulges. They are also short, but a nice length, so it isn't riding up anywhere, and I don't feel like every few feet I'd walk, I'd have to pull them down. I'm seriously considering buying another pair in another color because they are so nice. Definitely worth it."" — Jenny P. Get it from Amazon for $21.98+ (available in sizes S–3XL and 10 colors). Many reviewers recommend sizing up! Promising review: ""I'm a size 10 and have a 36DD bust. I normally feel really self-conscious in a two-piece, but I was looking for something I felt good in that would also be different than the typical mom suit. I wanted it for a trip to the Dominican with my husband. I bit the bullet and went for this after reading so many reviews. Let me just say, I am so glad I did. I love this suit so much that I’m gonna order another one in a different color. I felt cute, sexy, and confident in it. I normally wear a size large or sometimes a medium, and I followed the sizing tips and other reviews and ordered a 2XL. It fits perfectly. I love it."" — Kristina Suko Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in sizes S–5XL and eight styles). Promising review : ""I LOVE this swimsuit. It is super cute if you want to feel sexy but are looking for a little more coverage. I purchased a couple of these for a work trip so that I would feel comfortable in front of our leadership team. I'm not a large person but I have very curvy hips and size D/DD boobs, and I felt most comfortable in the XL. Since I have larger hips, I found the M and L to be a little too tight around the waist/hip area. The adjustable ties in the back and on the shoulder straps made it easy to fit the XL to the rest of my body without feeling suffocated around the hip area. I have a lot of trouble with bathing suits because of my hips and often times I have to size up for this reason but it doesn't always work because the suit ends up being to big everywhere else and sagging in the butt area. This suit is perfect — if you are curvy like me, go for it and just size up! You won't be disappointed, and what's not to love about all the fun colors it comes in?"" — Mallory Dunphy Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in sizes S–XL and 25 colors). Promising review: ""A staple. This swimsuit is so nice. The quality is amazing, and it fits like a glove. Do it."" — Arianna Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in sizes 12–28 and 25 colors). Promising review: ""I was a little skeptical about ordering this swimsuit because I have a pretty large chest and was worried about looking droopy in this top. I am so surprised how well this fit and it is my new favorite swimsuit. It’s got a very wide band and good back coverage. Absolutely love it! The bottoms are great too, double layer, fairly cheeky and hit me in just the right places!"" — Amanda Get it from Amazon for $31.19 (available in sizes XS–XL and five styles). Promising review: ""Love this swim dress. The top is perfect, I'm a busty girl and its *chefs kiss. The bikini bottoms are cute, the top/skirt fully covers my bum so you don't really see the bikini bottoms but I feel comfortable to wear this around from the beach to lunch."" — Shawna Get them from Simka Sol for $125 (available in sizes XS–3X). Promising reviews: ""I was wowed from the beginning with this suit! It is beautifully packed with care. I was so impressed when I tried it on. The material is smooth and feels nice. It is unique and I am very pleased and am happy that I took a risk and went with a designer that I am not familiar with."" — Stephchil ""I have been searching for a one piece for months now and everything has had something wrong with it. This suit is comfortable and the reversible print is stunning. It looks like it cost more than it did. It truly is reversible, there is no show of the other side when you flip it. I could have gone a size smaller but I’m still satisfied. I am a big fan and will be shopping Jessie Zhao more now!"" — Ariane Get it from Nordstrom for $139 (available in sizes S–XXL).

BuzzFeed Contributor Promising review: ""I bought this after discovering that my ingrown leg hairs weren't actually ingrown hairs, but KP. This product was very well reviewed, and although I avoid gritty scrubs because of my sensitive skin, I thought I'd give it a try. Wow. I haven't even finished the first tube, and I'm seeing some amazing results just using it twice a week. I am very impressed. This stuff really works. So happy to have beach-ready legs this summer!"" — Ghanimatrix Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes and three scents). Promising review: ""This is one of those things that I wish I'd found years earlier. I've suffered from mortifying stress-induced under-boob sweat for most of my adult life. Also, I'm a lifelong Seattle girl who gets upset when it's warmer than 65 degrees outside. So when I stumbled upon this product, I was curious enough to buy a small pack. And yes, I've come back for MORE! For real, I won't put on a bra without one of these liners now. It absorbs all the moisture from heat and stress. And because it's a really soft bamboo/cotton mix, my skin is finally not feeling tortured under there! To the makers of this ingenious life-changing product: thank you, thank you, thank you! Sincerely, all the grateful ta-tas you've helped to care for"" — Niko Get a three-pack from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes M–XXL and a variety of color combinations). Promising review: ""Very pleased with this purchase. Product is working on my sensitive teeth with no issues. Better results than Crest Whitestrips. Would and have recommended to others."" — Mel Get a two-pack from Amazon for $18.95 (also available in packs of one and four). Oh! BTW this stuff is reaaaally STRONG, so make sure you do a spot test first — especially if you have sensitive skin! Check out this review on TikTok ! Promising reviews: ""I saw this product on TikTok and I decided to give it a shot since it was only like $20 for 10 wipes (that's 10 weeks, 2.5 months) of no underarm sweat. It worked! I was so happy to finally be able to wear all the shirts I own that are not black! I only apply it every week, and all week long, there is NO sweat under my arms! This is amazing!"" — Nes172011 Get 10 wipes from Amazon for $19.99 (also available in packs of 20 and 30). For more info on how to use acupressure for nausea management, check out this guide from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . Promising review: ""I have always suffered from motion sickness. My whole life, I have hated long car rides, even short car rides. As soon as I get in the car and buckle in, I already feel the nausea. I bought these for a 16-hour road trip, and they worked 100%. I felt perfectly comfortable the whole way through. I could even watch movies and text on my phone and feel alright. My two daughters suffer from the same thing (ages 1 and 3) to the point where they can't keep any food down. The kid's bands worked for them 100% of the time, too. 10/10 recommend. I'll be buying more for sure."" — Veronica Get a pair from Amazon for $8.53+ (available in six colors). These mitts are also a great way to prep your skin before applying sunless tanner! Promising review: ""Right out of the box, I could tell these mitts were going to be exactly what I needed. Excellent quality and easy to use! I’ve tried them twice already, and my skin is now incredibly smooth! After I scrubbed my arm, I looked at the mitt and saw it was covered with dead skin cells. I’ll be buying more of these as gifts for girlfriends (in a fun spa gift basket)!"" — Danielle Get it from Amazon for $10.99+ (available in three colors and in multipacks). Here's why my BuzzFeed Shopping colleague Emma Lord loves this thing: ""Hello, my toenails are problem children for two reasons: One is that they're kinda thick, the other is that I'm a long-distance runner, which doesn't play nice with toenails. I bought this recently, and the difference it made immediately was ENORMOUS. Like I usually dread approaching my big toenails because they are so thick, but these painlessly and seamlessly lobbed the tops right off; I was also able to ~gently correct~ a toenail that was starting to get ingrown, and help cut down a dead toenail that needed trimming but would have been painful to approach with a regular clipper."" Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""Amazing! I have very oily skin, and I’m always shiny. I hate those blotting papers; this is so much better! I roll it all over my face several times a day, and in seconds, my skin is matte again. Also, it’s like a nice little face massage when I do it. It is super easy to take apart to clean, and after using hot water and my facial cleanser, it dries pretty quickly, though I usually just let it sit out overnight. Highly recommend!! I’m going to buy more so I can leave them all over — purse, diaper bag, bathroom, car!"" — Brooke Burns Get it from Amazon for $12.99 . This product is formulated without parabens, phthalates, petrolatum, or SLS. Promising review: ""I’ve had this bottle for over a year! It’s lasted with my family through Disney World, Destin spring break, and every time we go to the pool! I’ve had some bad sunburns. I slather this on and reapply after it’s soaked in, and I wake up with a deep tan. Whatever is in it is like magic! The smell is kinda weird to me, but as well as this lotion works, it could smell like cough syrup, and I’d still happily use it."" — Natalie Smith Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Read more about tea tree oil and acne at Cleveland Clinic . Apply this gentle treatment 3–4 times a day or 4–6 times if the situation is more serious. Promising review: "" Worked like magic! I put it on a bad breakout and it was almost completely gone the next day. Love it."" — Babygirl Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Promising review: ""I use these wipes after long walks in summer heat when I’m not at home to shower. They get rid of the sweat and leave me clean and refreshed without the sticky feeling you get from most wipes."" — sherry baker Get a three-pack (45 wipes) from Amazon for $19.99 . Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. Promising review: ""I don't write reviews often but this toothbrush is so amazing I just had to. My teeth have never felt so smooth after brushing my teeth . Excellent at removing plaque and tartar and keeping it off throughout the day. If you're on the fence about purchasing, consider this the green light to go for it. You won't be disappointed."" — Cari C. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""Was exactly what I wanted. I was able to wear plenty of sundresses on vacation without worrying about chafing and discomfort. Lasted after swimming, too!"" — TC_06 Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in three sizes). The hairs in your nose play an important role in filtering out any harmful debris. But of course, it's your body, and if you want to wax your nose hairs, you're more than welcome to — just be careful, as plucking nose hairs can lead to infection and ingrown hairs. Read more about nose hair maintenance at Cleveland Clinic . Pulling nose hair straight from the root will give you results that can last up to FOUR weeks! With this kit, you'll have 100 grams of nose wax beads, 30 wax applicators, 10 mustache protectors, a measuring cup, and 15 paper cups at your disposal. Promising review: ""This is the easiest to use and takes care of nose hair. My new favorite beauty aid. 😉"" — Jackie Phillips Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . Promising review: ""I love having this case in my purse! If I forget my meds in the morning, I always have them with me. There’s also room for pain relief meds and vitamins. It’s compact with great compartment options. I’m happy with this purchase!"" — Hayley Get a three-pack from Amazon for $6.96 . TookTake is a woman-owned small business that started as a DIY solution to organizing the founder's many medications throughout her cancer treatment. It evolved into the sticker system you see today. I have a pretty checkered past when it comes to consistently taking my daily vitamins and medicine. Lately, I've opted for an in-your-face series of phone alarms, but on more than one occasion, I have absent-mindedly snoozed said alarm, only to be left wondering an hour later if I actually took my pill. That's what I really like about these tracking stickers — the marked tabs give you that answer at a glance, reducing the chance of missed or doubled doses. The only complaint is that the tabs can be a little tricky to remove, as other reviewers mention, but if you have any semblance of a fingernail, it shouldn't give you too much trouble. This is a cheap and discrete solution for forgetful humans who want to stay on top of better taking care of themselves. Get a three-pack (12 labels) from Amazon for $14.97 (also available in 10-day and hourly editions). Promising review: ""After just two days of use, this adorable little octopus has done wonders for me and smells great, too. Here's how I used it: I wore down the stick just a little to where the texture from the salt was visible, scrubbed around on my face so there was plenty of product, and then used my fingers to gently massage all the gunk away. Rinse, pat dry, and enjoy the softness. Highly recommended for people with sensitive skin like myself. "" — LuckLocust Get it from Amazon for $12.50 . Promising review: ""I tried EVERYTHING! I tried tree tea oil for years and various different products. Nothing worked. The reviews were so great on this that I decided to try to cure it one more time. But when you have had a condition for 35 years, you aren’t too hopeful! I followed the suggestions of some of the reviewers and cut my toenails (I only had it on my big toes) everywhere that the fungus was present. Even below the quick. I started applying this gel, which is super easy to use. I swear to you that I noticed a difference after one application."" — WIAPilot Get it from Amazon for $16.99 . Doctor Easy started 20 years ago with the invention of the Elephant Ear Washer by a doctor who saw the need for a better method of treating patients’ earwax impactions. Promising review: ""Gross photos. My husband has had a lot of earwax impaction problems in his life, and up until this point, we have paid to have a professional take care of it. But recently, he suddenly lost about 80% of his hearing and just couldn't wait for an appointment, so we bought this item. From the reviews I have read, it was a particularly easy solution for my husband. Nasty huge chunks start falling out after just a couple of squirts. Cleared everything out with no problem. Highly recommend."" — Tea Get it from Amazon for $29.45 . Promising review: ""I am so grateful for this product! Between high-stress levels and a job that makes me sweat a lot in the summer, I was breaking out all over my chest and upper arms. This treated the bad spots I already had and, so far, seems to be keeping new ones at bay. I'm sad that it didn't help my KP at all, but that's not what I bought it for, so I still give it 5 stars!"" — Rachel D. Get it from Amazon for $13.99 . I started using this stuff recently and my nails look presentable for basically the first time ever. It's no one-time-use miracle — you have to be consistent about the application. But if you are consistent, you'll be able to maintain happy, hydrated nails and cuticles with pretty minimal effort. Fun bonus: It smells absolutely delicious. Promising review: ""I had peeling, weak nails for years. Tried everything. I bought this in February. This size bottle lasted a bit more than a month, with me religiously applying it two to three times a day. I was really seeing great improvement, so I bought another bottle in late March. By May, all the peeling had grown out, and my nails were getting stronger every day. I then bought the big 4-ounce refill bottle because I never want to run out of it again! Cannot recommend this stuff enough!"" — Diana Get it from Amazon for $9.90+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""As a 62-year-old woman who gardens, cleans house, etc., I needed something that improved the look of my nails without looking cheap or crappy. This was more than I wanted to spend on nail polish...but totally worth it. Two coats showed NO ridges and looked better than natural nails without looking fake or cheap . Totally worth it!"" — Unbiased Independent Reviewer Get it from Amazon for $20 (available in five shades). Promising review: "" Took me a little while to figure out the right angle to use this effectively but once I did it worked like a charm. I’ve used it for shaping eyebrows and managing the little bit of blonde peach fuzz I have on my upper lip. I haven’t tried it anywhere else but no bad reactions or pain, and relatively easy to maneuver with a bit of practice."" — Kelly G. Get a three-pack from Amazon for $5.94 . You can reuse them for up to two years! Set them out in the sun for an hour to re-activate the charcoal. Promising review: ""Honestly kind of amazed. I've had them for a few months and haven't 'reset' them in the sun yet, but so far, no problems. I had this ridiculously smelly pair of sandals that got gross and embarrassing in the summer, and I just put these guys in them overnight, and I can wear the sandals for days on end. Glad I got these for sure."" — Karen Get a set of two from Amazon for $10.95 . If you suspect you have tonsil stones (also called tonsilloliths), talk to your dentist or doctor! They can perform a physical exam or imaging scan and deliver a diagnosis. Promising review: ""I'm in my early 30s and just started getting tonsil stones. Until a few months ago, I never even knew what these things were! Anyway, I've been struggling with cotton buds to fully remove the stones, but I couldn't get rid of them, and they would just come back within the week. I received this and OMFG...best investment ever. No struggle holding my phone as a flashlight while awkwardly poking myself in front of my badly lit bathroom mirror. I sat comfortably at my vanity, used one hand, and removed the whole stone in less than a minute. Why did I not know this was a thing? Why have I been struggling? Get it! Stop struggling, suffering, and awkwardly dealing with this ridiculous condition...trust me."" — Wren Get it from Amazon for $9.98 (available in blue and yellow). Check out this review on TikTok ! Promising review: ""If you're someone that has sensitive skin like me, this product is for you! I highly recommend it. I learned about this product on TikTok and decided to try it out. It's worth the money. The smell is not overbearing, and it reminds you of a refreshing citrusy fruit. I'm very particular about trying skincare products, but this is your go-to. It will have your face feeling refreshed and clear, and there's no white cast."" — Elisabeth L. Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.99 . Puriya is a family-owned and operated business founded by two Taiwanese sisters who integrated their products with foundational ingredients from their mother's home-brew concoction of herbs and spices that she used to soothe their eczema as children. Read more about tea tree oil and how it can help with athlete's foot from Mayo Clinic and jock itch from Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""I ordered this balm on a whim as a remedy for a skin rash and was very impressed with its effectiveness! After getting rid of my rash, I decided to try it elsewhere and it worked wonders on dry skin areas like elbows, knees, and feet. I was blown away by how I changed my feet entirely! As a dancer, my feet have always been a war zone: dry skin, callouses, ingrown toenails, and athlete's foot (all frequent problems over the course of many years). I was always embarrassed to wear sandals or any type of shoes that would show off parts of my feet because of all the dry skin, but sometimes, it couldn't be avoided. This balm has made my feet the loveliest they have been, and now I can choose any type of shoes I want to wear without embarrassment. "" — anengstrom Get it from Amazon for $36.32 . Promising review: ""I had a stubborn wart on my right thumb that has been there for almost a year. Went to the doctor the first time to freeze it, but it didn't completely remove the wart, so I decided to try the gel. The gel helped, but not for too long, and the wart came back (in a couple of days). Long story short, I got these medicated bandages and the results are incredibly satisfying. I used these bandages every day for a week, and the next week, my wart is gone. So far, it's been a week after and I haven't noticed any growth. Highly recommend!"" — J Get a pack of 14 from Amazon for $7.29+ (available in three styles). Promising review: ""After just about three weeks of use I’ve seen such a positive change in both the evenness of time and of the texture of my skin. Melasma and acne scarring have faded pretty dramatically — I don’t even bother putting on foundation when I do my makeup in the morning. The oil is so lightweight and doesn’t exacerbate my already oily complexion. "" — L T C Get it from Amazon for $11.12 . Read more about compression gloves and other strategies to help relieve hand pain at Mayo Clinic . Promising review: ""As a professional tennis racquet stringer, I often work for 8–10 hours straight at the stringing machine. At 58 years old and having done this work for many years, I have developed arthritis in my hands. I’ve worn out many pairs of gloves similar to these. Most are cheaply made and torn apart at the seams in days. ComfyBrace gloves are the best quality I have found. They provide the relief I need, they’re comfortable, and they last longer than the other brands I’ve tried. With these gloves, I’m able to continue working a trade that I love. Thank you, ComfyBrace! Try these, and you will not regret it!"" — M. McDonald Get them from Amazon for $9.97 (available in unisex sizes S–XL). Bro Shaver is a Michigan-based small business with 14 years of research and development behind their innovative line of shavers for hard-to-reach places. Promising review: ""Wow. This is amazing! Followed the instructions and took my time during the first use. Just me and my bathroom mirror. About 20 minutes later, I have a perfectly smooth back. No nicks or missed spots. My back feels smooth to the touch. Now, I won't avoid the pool or lake this summer. A very smart purchase for me. I wish I had thought to take a before and after picture."" — David Get it from Amazon for $44.95 . Promising review: ""I have a TMJ mouth guard that is about 12 years old, and nothing else I've tried had managed to clean it like this stuff . It didn't take everything off the first time, but it makes a HUGE difference. Very satisfied."" — Sara E Get 120 tablets from Amazon for $21.81 .

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/buzzfeednews/buzzfeed-news-oral-history-2012-2023,news,,“We Were Always Playing An Entirely Different Game”: The Ultimate Oral History Of BuzzFeed News,15,11893,27,13,"BuzzFeed News has been described as a chaos agent, a pirate ship, a reputable news organization, and, most notably, a “failing pile of garbage” by former president Donald Trump. We wanted to tell our own story — in our own words — about what it was like to be a part of it. BuzzFeed News BuzzFeed launched a news section in 2012. It hired a ton of people, opened international offices, produced podcasts and shows, formed a union, won a Pulitzer Prize. Then it shuttered international offices, laid people off, and on Friday, May 5, shut down for good and archived its website. Hundreds of people worked here over the years and made this place what it was — this oral history is an incomplete account of what made this place both extraordinary and exasperating. There are so many stories and people missing, either because it got too long, we ran out of time, or we had to delete some of the really juicy stuff. (Testimonials have been edited for length and clarity.) If your interest is an analysis of the business forces that led to this moment, there are plenty of thorough and smart assessments (our former editor-in-chief just wrote a whole book, awkwardly released the same week we were told we needed to close, about how digital media was doomed.) We wanted to make this oral history so that the final word on BuzzFeed News (literally, the last thing to be published on our site) would come from the people who worked here. If you’re reading this, or have read our stories before, thank you. If you watched our shows, listened to our podcasts, clicked on our push alerts and tweets, or scrolled past our headlines on your phone, we want to sincerely thank you for supporting us, sharing our work, and helping us survive (and even thrive!) in a chaotic media landscape as long as we did. — Katie Notopoulos McKay Coppins, former politics reporter: In the beginning, “BuzzFeed News” was basically Ben Smith, Rosie Gray, Zeke Miller, Andrew Kaczynski, and me covering the 2012 Republican presidential primaries. Ben’s instructions to us were basically: Don’t waste time doing the same stories everyone is doing. Break news, get scoops, make trouble. I remember at the first Republican presidential debate in early 2012, Ben named our portable Wi-Fi thing “BUZZFEED SURVEILLANCE DRONE” so that the other outlets would see it on their laptops and get freaked out. Doree Shafrir, former executive editor: Ben Smith sent me a DM on Twitter and asked if I wanted to meet with him — it was before he had actually started but his hiring had been announced. I remember the process going fairly quickly — I met with Jonah Peretti and Ken Lerer, and then it was done. Those first few months of 2012 were bananas. I started in February — I think I was employee No. 65 — and we were hiring multiple people per week. The mandate was to grow grow grow. There was no real sense from Ben about what it took to launch or maintain multiple lifestyle and entertainment verticals — like we should just launch a sports vertical, covering national sports, with two or three people. Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: I was hired in early 2012 to do the viral list stuff. Michael Hastings, who was a big-time actual journalist, sat next to me. He’d be on the phone like, screaming at Reince Priebus and I’d be looking at a Tumblr of Sonic the Hedgehog erotica. We got along great. One time I had to actually call someone for a post, and Ben Smith said to me, “Look at you, you’re doing reporting!” I was disgusted. At the time, “news” was just a handful of verticals: politics, tech, sports, “women’s interest.” It was fluid between the viral and news people. We had a big weekly meeting where we’d dissect the top-performing posts and why they worked. There was a giant TV screen that showed the leaderboard of who had the most traffic. Around 2014, there was an official segmenting of “News” from “Buzz” (viral lists and quizzes) and “Life” (food, fashion DIY). At some point in a reorg that seemed, from the plebes within, to be a result of some sort of nightmare Mothra vs. Godzilla fight, Buzz and Life were moved under Ze Frank, who ran video, and Ben Smith was in charge of just news. Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief: I was always ambivalent about splitting News. It felt culturally inevitable after the political and social climate changed, but it played to journalists’ worst, snobbish instincts in some ways. We worked for BuzzFeed, after all, and it pulled News toward feeling like a charity. It seemed necessary at the time — in the Trump era, News was too dark to be next to the BuzzFeed Brand — but I had some worries. Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: The first time I set foot in the BuzzFeed office was December 2011 for a meeting with Ben and the other three reporters he’d hired to cover the 2012 election. Ben said to us something to the effect of “Tell people you’re with BuzzFeed the same way you would tell them you’re with the New York Times.” I officially started a couple weeks later. I drove Ben back to New York after the New Hampshire primary, and he spent half the drive on his computer writing a story. We talked about whether I was going to finish college, and we both halfheartedly said that I really should, and I think we both knew it wasn’t going to happen. Michael Hastings reports from the Obama campaign trail the day before the general election, Nov. 5, 2012, in Des Moines, Iowa. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: I fell in love with BuzzFeed back during the 2012 election. I consumed anything and everything Michael Hastings, Ruby Cramer, and McKay Coppins wrote. When BuzzFeed hired Andrew Kaczynski, I decided there was nowhere else I wanted to work. Andrew had built a name for himself by aggressively digging up old C-SPAN clips of Republican primary candidates. I decided that if there is a place out there weird enough to hire the Old C-SPAN Clips Guy, they might be weird enough to hire me. John Herrman, former tech editor: I remember the office in 2012 with white walls and red pipes. Good view. When it rained our internet was bad, because it was being beamed from the Empire State Building. Three grinning visages haunted the room. Jonah Peretti. Ben Smith. Jon Steinberg. Your goal was to avoid eye contact with them. One way I can describe Ben and Jonah, who are otherwise fairly different people, is as guys who seem like they’d never make eye contact who instead make it all the time. A birthday party for Grumpy Cat goes on in one conference room in 21st Street office in New York City, while John Herrman tries to work in another, circa 2012. Ellie Hall, senior reporter: I was the first person to be hired for the newly formed “News” team in 2013. The first big test of our operation was the Boston Marathon bombings, and those long days made it clear to all of us that we needed an adult in the room. Enter Lisa Tozzi. She came to the office before she was officially hired for a sort of “meet your possible boss” group lunch/interview, and we were all blown away. We all swarmed Ben and essentially demanded that he hire her as news director. We all looked up to her — literally, because she was one of the first people in the entire office to use a standing desk. Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief: I hired Lisa Tozzi to run the breaking news team. I remember how impressed I was by Lisa — but then how massively impressed everyone was to have someone descend from the heights of the New York Times to join us, and then being a little annoyed by that because why should everyone be so worshipful of the Times! Lisa Tozzi, former news director: I was in Ben’s office or something at the old District 9, crowded, vermin-infested 21st Street office. Some Anthony Weiner stuff was happening, and Ellie Hall came running over and slapped this on the glass. (We blurred, I believe.) Zoe Tillman, former politics reporter : The day I interviewed in the New York office it was Ben Smith’s birthday. There were pieces of paper with a close-up photo of Ben’s face taped up all over the walls as I entered the building. When I got to the newsroom, everyone in the room was wearing a T-shirt with the picture of Ben. His face was everywhere. Tom Namako, former news director: I used to literally turn on the lights and unlock the doors at the office above Home Depot at 5:55 a.m. and would find McKay sometimes sitting with Diet Coke cans around him, just agonizing over his computer, on the floor. He’d scare the shit out of me. McKay Coppins, former politics reporter: There was a stretch where I was staying late at the office writing several nights a week and there was this one coworker I didn’t really know who would show up after midnight and sort of nod at me from a distance and then just...stay. Somewhere in the office. I’m pretty sure she was living there, but I didn’t know for sure. BuzzFeed News staffers Myles Tanzer, Johana Bhuiyan, Katie Notopoulos, and Charlie Warzel Tom Warren, investigative reporter: The first time I visited the New York office, I stepped over the threshold only to be greeted by a man on a hoverboard holding a tray of sex toys, some of which were frankly quite terrifying. He registered my surprise, then cackled and sped off down the corridor. I never found out why he was doing that or whether HR should have gotten involved. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter : I’d come from the Village Voice, and other local papers before that, and every place I’d worked was facing existential crisis. Then suddenly, Adam Serwer recruits me onto BuzzFeed’s National desk, and there’s free lunch and tons of happy-looking people hopping around. It felt like a fantasy — excess and money and bright colors and whimsically shaped chairs all around. I couldn’t believe such a place existed in the journalism industry. I remember my first BuzzFeed Christmas party, in 2014, walking into this fancy club space, in lower Manhattan, dim lights, lots of dancing. And, there, up on a stage: acrobats and fire dancers. I remember thinking, like, Damn, either we’re saved or we’re doomed . Joel Anderson, former sports and national reporter: On my first day, an email went out to the office: Kanye West was coming in for a visit with Jonah. When I got down to their floor, Kanye was sitting in a tight office, wildly gesticulating while Jonah sat there impassively. I snuck a picture and then tweeted it out. A few minutes later, another email went out: We shouldn’t gather around Jonah’s office, and we definitely shouldn’t be posting pictures about the visit. Heh, it was too late. I didn’t delete the tweet, and I’ve still got the picture. Kanye West talks to Jonah Peretti in the BuzzFeed offices. Dan Vergano, former science reporter : I started work in February on a cold Tuesday morning [in the DC office], and waited. Then this big dude came shambling up to the door I had been buzzing to get into for 10 minutes, lit a cigarette, and asked me if I was Dan. It was John Stanton, who I quickly figured out was actually a friend of a bouncer friend of my wife’s from my misspent youth in DC. My new colleagues all struck me as twentysomething strivers, but with perpetual hangovers. It took me about a week to figure out everyone was reporting and writing their pieces on their phone. Venessa Wong, senior culture reporter : My first job here in 2015 was to report on food companies. I did a really simple post about McDonald’s selling mozzarella sticks for $1, just something short and fun that I put very little time into, and suddenly half a million people had read that story. It was a level of reach I had never experienced before, and it was absolutely thrilling and terrifying. There was a clear sense that if something was being said online, people were hearing it from BuzzFeed. Hayes Brown, former deputy world news editor: It was an absolute dream of a gig to work under World desk editor Miriam Elder and in the pirate ship that DC Bureau Chief John Stanton was running. I was so proud (and to be frank, a little smug) when I’d tell people all the cities where we had correspondents based, which over the years included Mexico City, Istanbul, Nairobi, Dakar, Beijing, Hong Kong, New Delhi, and Moscow. Tom Warren, investigative reporter: Despite the warnings of more experienced journalists that I would be mad to work at BuzzFeed, I applied as soon as they opened an investigations unit. All we wanted to do was blow the fucking doors off…and guess what happens when you give a group of twentysomethings unlimited resources to chase stories? They go batshit crazy. Absolutely fucking bananas. We flew round the world chasing tips, conducted surveillance ops on money launderers, took sources out for mindblowingly expensive meals in the hope of getting leaked documents, rode through rainforests on the back of motorbikes, and engaged in a host of other wild adventures, not all of which are fit to print. There were wild parties, lots of them. One week you would be at a warehouse rave in Brooklyn, and two weeks later you would be flying into Istanbul for security training and heading for a night out with whichever members of the press corps were in town. We had the wind at our backs and had a beast of a fucking time. It was majestic. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter : I think one reason the vibes were always so positive, and the place never felt internally competitive the way some other newsrooms do, is that we had this collective mindset of abundance. To put it crudely, we were all trying to build our newsroom’s credibility, so every colleague's success helped elevate your own reputation. For a while, the newsroom would echo with the same script: Hi, my name is so-and-so, I’m a reporter with BuzzFeed News, and I’m working on a... BuzzFeed... B-U-Z-Z-F-E-E-D... it’s a digital news outlet..."" That was like the soundtrack of those early days. It became a running joke. But then eventually, maybe by early 2016, we didn't have to spell it out anymore. Karolina Waclawiak, editor-in-chief: I had been at the Believer Magazine (which had literally no budget for anything) and Saeed Jones called me and said he wanted me to join and start a literary magazine within BuzzFeed News with him. Then the Pulse nightclub shooting happened, and suddenly I was swept into the news cycle. Ben Smith told me culture touched everything so I had to find a way to cover…everything. Soon after, I was sending reporters to Trump rallies and all over the country covering news. When I first started, I asked what our budget was for the Culture desk and was told, “Don’t ask or you might get one,” from someone who worked in Finance. When I saw what editors were paying for stories on other desks I was in absolute shock. I knew it couldn’t last. Saeed Jones (left) and Isacc Fitzgerald pose for a publicity photos for BuzzFeed News’ morning Twitter show AM2DM. Doree Shafrir, former executive editor: There was so much organizational-slash-strategy whiplash. Like they would launch projects and it would be the hot new thing for like six months and then they would be like, Actually, never mind . The relationship between News and main BuzzFeed, and then with video, was insane. Like, no one was in charge. Brandon Hardin, curation editor: For a while it felt like the only money you could depend on was from social media platforms for shows. AM2DM was funded by Twitter, sort of a morning talk show. Facebook gave us money for Profile , hosted by Audie Cornish, when they still had the laughable idea people were going to watch longform journalism on Facebook. Other shows, including a game show, were spun up, wound down, and forgotten about. We had a podcast for a bit you could summon on Alexa. In theory. Because it turned out calling a podcast “The News By BuzzFeed News” made it basically impossible to call up, as Alexa stopped listening after the first “news.” Julia Moser, former AM2DM producer: The pitch for AM2DM was essentially “the Today show/ Good Morning America but our anchors are allowed to say ‘fuck’ and wear jeans.” Our original motto was “All the news too lit to print” and then the New York Times sent us a cease and desist I believe? There was one week where I produced a segment about MS-13 with John Stanton and also was trying to book Bruno, a very fat cat who’d gone viral on Twitter, which to me was BuzzFeed News and AM2DM in a nutshell. Zach Ares, senior motion designer and drag queen: For one of their first promos, AM2DM made a video called “Tucker Carlson looks at his guests like they’re eating mayo straight out of the jar ”... and then Jesse McLaren, and hosts Saeed Jones and Isaac Fitzgerald, ate a full jar of mayo on camera. [Editor’s note: Saeed and Isaac actually ate vanilla pudding. Still gross.] Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: I like to imagine Elon Musk’s face if he ever finds out that Twitter paid to run a BuzzFeed News morning show. That’s worth it all. Veronica Dulin, DC office manager/editorial assistant: I was the office manager and had to escort all the AM2DM guests up to the top floor. One day, the guest was the attorney general of Texas, who was accompanied by an armed security team. During the interview, a guy sidled up to me and said, “Hey, we can’t find our friend Chris. I think he’s trapped somewhere.” The elevator in the DC office was always breaking down, and I feared the worst. We found him trapped on the fifth floor, and we had to yank the doors of the broken elevator open to get him out. I spent the whole time bonding with this man to try and get him to not tell mean stories about how the liberal news outlet trapped him. After the interview, Zoe Tillman, who had interviewed the AG, came up to me and asked which guy got caught. I told her and she said, “Oh my god, that’s Chris SCALIA.” I trapped the son of a Supreme Court justice in the elevator. David Mack, senior reporter: I was one of the fill-in hosts for AM2DM , which meant I got to interview a ton of big name stars on camera. Producers would also try to ensure I got to interview every famous Aussie that came through, including Guy Pearce, Jacki Weaver, and Toni Collette. The viewership of the show would mostly depend on whether Twitter boosted it on the platform, which was worrying from the start. I also helped host shows we briefly had on Facebook ( Profile ) and Snapchat ( BTW ). All of these received money from the platforms, which of course was not going to last forever. But that’s just how it was. I was hired to write and edit, and all of a sudden I was hosting TV. It felt like we were really booming into a full media division. I trace it back to when homepage editor Gavon Laessig did a Facebook Live on Super Tuesday for the 2016 election and we got a ton of views by doing stunts like making him take shots when a different race was called. He got smashed, but it was fun! And then suddenly we were in the live news business. Tom Namako, former news director: Gavon Laessig’s Facebook Live election show needs an oral history of its own. He threw up on the floor of politics editor Katherine Miller’s office, and she never went back in again because of the smell. We basically held him hostage in there for eight hours feeding him only bourbon and, I think, ice cream. Gavon Laessig, former breaking news editor: The pitch for this Facebook Live show was “Watch As Super Tuesday Ruins This Man’s Night One State At A Time.” I would do drinking games while I interviewed politics editors and reporters, all while providing real-time updates to the 2016 presidential primaries. A microphone, several bottles of liquor, and a tub of peanut butter were placed in front of me. At one point I put Mentos in my mouth and swigged Diet Coke, simply destroying the carpet with a geyser of foam spraying out of my mouth. I think I did this for four or five hours before Lisa Tozzi and Shani Hilton, legitimately concerned for my health, pulled the plug. They kept feeding me seltzer so I’d have something besides ice cream and Southern Comfort in my stomach. Shockingly, I don’t remember many of the details. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: Being in the LA office, a lot of our shows felt like “a New York thing” that I didn’t have any connection with beyond waking up to some amazing content every morning, but there were eventually some that were more anchored with LA: Hella Opinions was an amazing talk show on Wednesday nights, and there was also a short-lived HQ Trivia knockoff called Outside Your Bubble. There was a period of time in my life where I had to help oversee a nightly game show in the Facebook app? Emerson Malone, copy editor: We had a short-lived experimental video animated series on Spotify, of all places. It was something that required animators and graphic designers, and it would come down to West Coast copy editors to look at it late at night. The video would go live in the morning, but by then it would be yesterday’s news if not news from two days previous. And it was a video… that lived somewhere… on Spotify. Julia Furlan, former head of audio: From what I can tell, some bigwig at Spotify approached Ben and said, “We want to experiment with video,” and Ben was like, “OK sure, why don’t we make a video podcast?” But it would have been way too complicated to do longform video podcasts and Spotify didn’t want that. So we decided to adapt our daily podcast into video. In order to do that, Spotify needed us to upload our video every day by 4 a.m. And thanks to Dennis Huynh, the amazing design director and a team of animators who worked overnight in India, we managed to figure it out. And then Spotify just like….didn’t upload it. Like, every day we were doing this absurd task and Spotify’s team could not figure out how to play it in their app. Emerson Malone : Copy also looked at each episode of the Netflix show Follow This , which was sometimes wild, because in one of Scaachi’s episodes I literally had to ask: Scaachi Koul, senior culture writer: That sex doll episode still haunts me. We went to the house of a guy who owned four dolls, and he had them hanging by their necks on the wall. One of our camera guys had to help move one, and he lifted the doll to repose her (these things are like 120 pounds of dead weight), and after he did it, he had two huge boob-sized prints on his shirt. It turns out you have to dust the sex dolls with cornstarch so that the skin feels like skin and doesn’t get sticky. BuzzFeed staffers are photographed with Bill Murray at the 23rd Street office in 2015. BuzzFeed staffers reluctantly pose with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in New York City. Julia Reinstein, senior reporter: I remember one time there was someone running around the office in a ghost mask scaring people, and I later found out it was Bella Thorne. Another time, I was playing with several puppies that were in the office for a video when Seth Rogen suddenly popped his head out of a room. He made direct eye contact with me as I was lying on the floor covered in puppies and nearly crying. Johana Bhuiyan, former tech reporter: BuzzFeed is probably the only place I could make eye contact with T.I. while trying to decide which pieces of day-old sushi from yesterday’s free lunch were likely to hurt my stomach the least. Emma Loop , former BuzzFeed Canada and politics reporter: I was in the New York newsroom one time – I think I was there working with the investigations team on some money trail stuff. All of a sudden I heard singing. As I followed the sound, I discovered Hanson — yes, the ’90s boy band of “MMMBop” fame — playing a concert in the canteen. Jason Wells, executive editor of news: At the Beverly office In LA, Paul Rudd (a crush for many of us) visited the office for a photo shoot to promote a movie. We all positioned ourselves in the warehouse-open floor plan office to get as good a view as possible when he was ushered through to the photo set. He arrived, we all freaked out on Slack. Then Paul saw the Slack conversation in the studio room on an employee’s laptop and started typing in the channel, which meant he saw all our thirsty slacks. He then marched out into the office area and yelled something like “How DARE you all objectify me!” before laughing. We all freaked out. Paul Rudd (left) and Jason Wells in the LA offices of BuzzFeed News Paul McLeod, former politics reporter: During the 2016 Republican National Convention, BuzzFeed News threw a big, swanky party on a rooftop hotel in downtown Cleveland. I look over and see Rudy Giuliani in the corner drinking scotch and smoking cigars. Our DC bureau chief, John Stanton, was a tall, heavily tattooed man who wore black and lots of skull rings. Lovely guy, but apparently Giuliani’s bodyguards thought he was some kind of anarchist because when he approached Rudy to ask a question they tackled him to the ground. David Mack, senior reporter: On the night of the 2016 election, I was working in the newsroom in New York. We were doing a huge live show on one of the social media platforms (with dozens of professional outside crew members) and they had planned all this fun stuff. Quickly, the mood turned. That morning, I’d gone for a jog and thought to myself, On the random chance that Trump wins, I should just publish a post of people swearing different swear words on Twitter . I did end up getting to publish that at 2:45 a.m. , but Ben made me put the headline “Well, Fuck” in quotes so it didn’t seem like it was us saying it — which I think was cowardly! I went home, stared at the ceiling for two hours, came back to work, and Ben, to his credit, gave an inspiring speech to the newsroom about getting started on the most important work of our careers. Steve Kandell, former features editor: On election night 2016, Charlie Warzel, Miriam Elder, and I were talking in the hallway right as things were just starting to turn and feel weird. The Decision Desk dude walked out of the bathroom and said, “It’s all happening,” and he was just in there throwing up. That seemed bad. From left: Ben Smith, Janine Gibson, Shani Hilton, and Mark Schoofs Hayes Brown, former deputy world news editor: My desk in 2016 was right in front of the executive suite of offices. I remember seeing a flurry of activity one night, with Ben Smith, Miriam Elder, and Mark Schoofs all hustling around with a clear sense of urgency but nobody letting on why. At one point, I looked over and saw Ben crouched down typing away at a laptop perched on a shelf only a foot or two off the floor. Minutes later, The dossier was online . Matt Mittenthal, communications director: I’d just accepted the job of running comms for BuzzFeed News but hadn’t started. Ben published the dossier at 6:20 p.m. on Jan. 10 [2017], then sent me this: Clarissa-Jan Lim, senior reporter: On March 6, 2020, Tom Namako sent out an email telling us to start bringing all our stuff home every day — laptop, mouse, keyboard, etc. That was when we were still doing stories of couples navigating coronavirus-era dating and working from home together, and I thought BuzzFeed was maybe a bit too panicked about the pandemic. I’ve never been more wrong because a few days later, on March 11 , everything happened. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter : I get a call from our science editor, Azeen, asking if I can go to New Rochelle to report on the first coronavirus containment zone in the US. On my way up there the following day, I dropped by the office, where Tom Namako gave me a bunch of safety gear. For the mask to fit properly, I had to shave my beard, which probably stands as the greatest sacrifice I’ve ever made for this company. Employees of the San Francisco bureau of BuzzFeed News Mat Honan, former San Francisco bureau chief: Something I figured out pretty quickly was that — at least in those days — there was no budgetary limit on ambitious work. Incredible! The answer to “Can we spend this?” was always “Yes” if it was a good story. Caroline O’Donovan, former tech reporter: Mat Honan told the San Francisco office he had this big surprise. It turned out to be the BuzzFeed Open Lab, a giant glass box where we paid these engineers and nerds $100,000 a year to make stuff with projectors and animatronic stuffed animals. It was supposed to be like a media tech incubator; Mat said it would have soldering irons and welding equipment. When it opened we threw a big party and people kept crashing their hoverboards into the walls. Tom Warren, investigative reporter: More than once I would ask an editor if it was unreasonable to take a source to a £150-a-head restaurant. If the source was good enough, the answer was always yes. My time at BuzzFeed meant my tastes have become expensive. But alongside all the wild spending, the truth is that a lot of money was spent on reporting. Other newsrooms asked journalists to take risks, without considering their safety. We had an excellent security team to look after us, and editors would spend thousands chasing a story. That meant we often beat the big players like the New York Times or the Guardian, which was a delicious feeling. Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: In my recollection, 2014 to 2016 was really the peak in terms of the feeling that there were unlimited resources. Even the most far-flung, expensive reporting trips would get approved, and we were constantly hiring. By that point I was in DC and we were doing these BuzzFeed Brews events with various notables and having big White House Correspondents Dinner parties. This was the era captured in that Awl thing that was like “ I hate my life because I don’t work for BuzzFeed .” Veronica Dulin, DC office manager/editorial assistant : Holy shit, the WHCA Dinner afterparties. As someone who saw the budgets, they were all open bar for hundreds of people, including a ton who weren’t on the guest list, and which everyone at the company could bring like 10 people they wanted to. They’d lay off journalists …then throw this fucking rager for tens of thousands of dollars in April in order to get what, access for the journalists we’d laid off?? It was absolutely insane and only done for clout. They threw those after the Facebook bubble. What were they doing??? Photo editor Laura Geiser works in the “attic” of the BuzzFeed LA offices. The attic was notorious for having low beams that ran across the space. Karolina Waclawiak, editor-in-chief: When I first started in the Beverly office in LA in 2016, I remember being told we had a valet, and I was so confused. This was normal? Yes, apparently it was. We had several valet workers parking and getting our cars for us every day. Some of the people who worked in that office were in their early 20s and had never worked anywhere else so they thought this was normal, I guess? I had heard about excesses in tech companies but I had to call my immigrant parents to tell them we had a valet who was parking my car every day because it was so wild to me. And I remember my mom asking how we were making money to pay for all of this, and I said, “Who knows?” Jessica Garrison, former investigations reporter: There was fresh Pressed $9 juice several times a week delivered to the LA office. Ken Bensinger, former investigative reporter: Peak tech company excess moment might have been the holiday swag announcement in 2014 (or was it 2015?) when Jonah did a show and kept saying ""But wait, there's more!” We all got duffel bags, sweatpants, sweatshirts, and socks, and a weird little key fob with the number of employees on staff at the time. Then, in 2016, he did the holiday swag announcement with his hoodie pulled up and it looked like a hostage video, and that's when we knew the wave had crested and moved on. Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: An incomplete list of things BuzzFeed gave all employees while I was there: iPad Mini Apple Watch Winter pompom hats in six-plus different colors, one for each year A woven blanket with the viral arrow A fleece blanket that was just colorful Three-plus pairs of BuzzFeed branded socks Three-plus tote bags Five T-shirts with different city office names on them, all in one year One longsleeve BuzzFeed shirt Uncountable T-shirts tied to events Two BuzzFeed hoodies One pair of BuzzFeed sweatpants Two pairs Bluetooth over-the-ear headphones, branded A BuzzFeed backpack A BuzzFeed duffel-style gym bag Several drink koozies A limited-edition print of a drawing of a cat made by a machine by artist Cory Arcangel Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: There was the infamous cat drawing by Jonah’s friend Cory Arcangel that we all received as a holiday present one year. It was literally a really basic line drawing of a cat, like a doodle, on computer paper. Each copy was individually numbered, and Jonah claimed these artworks would appreciate in value. We were dying laughing about this. I think I still have it somewhere. Claudia Koerner, deputy director breaking news: The LA Christmas party was at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter one year, presumably through the deal we had with NBC Universal. We had the run of the park, and a bunch of us on News just rode the roller coaster again and again. There was food and an open bar, but if you wanted to spike your Butterbeer, you had to do it on the sly. David Mack, senior reporter: For the first few years, we also had Pride parties at massive New York City event spaces. These weren’t just for BuzzFeed staffers, either. I think they were cosponsored by alcohol brands, but it was still nuts. At my first holiday party at Webster Hall, I got so drunk (everyone was) that I made a point of thanking Jonah in person for all the drinks, then climbed on a little platform all the gays were dancing on. When I stepped off, I slipped on a puddle of booze and hit my ribs and was injured for weeks. As the years went by, the Pride parties ended, and the holiday parties became smaller and smaller. Once they stopped allowing us to bring our partners, I was like, Uh-oh . The BuzzFeed News curation team in November 2019 Jason Wells, executive editor of news: I’ll never forget how Ben Smith sent me to help staff up and resettle our news team in Sydney with explicit instructions to use my corporate card to wine and dine the staff, make everyone feel special, and meet with potential business partners. I was there for a month and did just that. A few months later, after I returned, we laid the entire team off to save money. BuzzFeed staffers in the London office enjoy oysters for lunch in 2017. Ikran Dahir, internet culture reporter: I remember the day the London office got oysters for our free lunch like it was yesterday. It was May 2017. Everyone laughed when we saw the lunch announcement in the morning because surely not actual oysters ? But there they were at lunchtime, and not many of us ate them. That wasn’t the only time a free meal at work was slightly fancy. On one Friday, there were breakfast mimosas! All of this felt very ridiculous when redundancies in the UK were announced just a few months later that year. Ema O'Connor and Weed Dude talk in the 11th floor newsroom of the New York offices Joel Anderson, former sports and national reporter: I left in the summer of 2017, before things really got bad. But I always, always suspected that things weren’t sustainable. I’d worked in the media long enough to know that eventually we’d have to make money and we kept hiring so many people. I’m probably getting this wrong, but I think we hired roughly two people a day from 2014 to 2015. Opened lots of offices overseas and domestically. Everyone seemed to understand the ride was going to be fun, but short. My editor — one of the loveliest, best people I know — always used to say: “Joel, just spend the money!” Which was a nice thought, but it seemed so shortsighted. I’d come from places where they’d taken out coffeemakers and even cut back on toilet paper. The bills were always going to come due. Tom Warren, investigative reporter: I think the writing was on the wall in the international offices far earlier. Colleagues we worked with in France and then Germany were unceremoniously sacked, and the London office faced wave after wave of heartbreaking layoffs. There was a lot of anger in those early sackings — we all had a sort of codependent relationship with BuzzFeed, and people felt like they were being dumped. Adam B. Vary, former entertainment reporter: In October 2017, the New York Times and the New Yorker published their blockbuster stories about Harvey Weinstein, and Ben, who’d spent years treating the Entertainment News desk with benign neglect, suddenly became fixated on the fact that we had not, somehow, landed the biggest and most difficult entertainment news story in my lifetime. By the end of that month, our team was split up, our editor (my third — of five!) resigned, and an internal memo was leaked to the trades which singled out “the holes in our Weinstein coverage” for the changes. It felt punitive and arbitrary, and I’m clearly still a little mad about it, but more importantly, it burst that magic feeling of my first four years at BuzzFeed. I realized how precarious everything actually was, so when the first round of layoffs hit in 2019, it just felt like the trajectory of the place was no longer ascendant. Julia Furlan, former head of audio: One afternoon, water started pouring out of a pipe in the ceiling right over the Pod Squad desks, so we had to move all our stuff. A media reporter from the Wall Street Journal had already started asking our producers if we were getting laid off, and the execs were like, “Let’s wait until the water situation is resolved, and then we will lay you off.” Instead I said, “No, do it now,” and so they unceremoniously called us one by one into their office as the water continued to pour into the newsroom. They laid off the whole team; it was ice cold. They said we didn’t have the numbers, but the truth is they didn’t have any idea what they were doing with us. Albert Samaha, senior culture reporter : What really birthed the union was when management shuttered the Pod Squad in October 2018. Every person on that team was beloved, extremely talented, and doing exceptional work — and on top of that, these were mostly women and people of color. The news was shocking, and the meeting in the newsroom when Ben and Shani announced it was gutting. A bunch of people were crying. I really couldn’t believe that leadership had no idea how to make podcasting profitable, when we had such an impressive head start in a direction the industry was so clearly going in. It was the moment I lost trust in the folks making the big decisions. It was the moment that radicalized me, from someone who casually supported the idea of a union to someone volunteering to help lead the organizing effort. I went to my first union meeting that night, and the NewsGuild conference room was filled with other colleagues who were also making their first appearance. Before that day, just a handful of colleagues were actively participating in the effort. Afterward, damn near the whole newsroom was on board. David Mack, senior reporter: Once we started closing international offices (RIP BuzzFeed Canada, BuzzFeed France, BuzzFeed Mexico, BuzzFeed News Oz), it was clear to everyone we’d expanded too fast and the good times were coming to an end. We still were trying new things, but the years of unchecked spending were over. Gradually, we became more like an establishment outlet and less of an underdog startup. When Ben left for the Times, I realized there were the Ben boom years and the Ben bust years, and I think he’d admit that he wasn’t having as much fun towards the end with our first mass layoffs in early 2019. Those were horrific. I saw managers weeping. I wept. But we soldiered on as best we could, even if we did spend the next few years trying to fight as we were getting limbs chopped off like the Black Knight from Monty Python. Despite all this, the closure comes as a shock. We were told we had more time, and we were hitting the goals they’d set for us. Venessa Wong, senior culture reporter : BuzzFeed’s business model kept changing. When I joined in 2015, native advertising seemed like the future. Because we weren’t relying on banner ads and pop-ups like other sites, our story pages were so clean. Yet from the perspective of someone far away from the decision makers at the company before it was publicly reporting financials, the business seemed off. The company had already had layoffs in 2017 because it had failed to reach revenue goals, and many more rounds would follow. When BuzzFeed spun off a separate news website (BuzzfeedNews.com) in 2018, I was seriously worried that we were being cut off from the lifeblood of BuzzFeed.com, and its massive audience, not to mention its sales and business resources. When BuzzFeed acquired HuffPost in 2020 and were told we would continue to operate completely independently and compete with them for stories, many of us worried how long the company would want to run two newsrooms. Gina Rushton, former reproductive rights reporter, Australia: I wouldn’t change a second of it, except maybe for the inevitable end to us being a forgotten outpost when we got unceremoniously laid off, at 2 a.m. our time, on my birthday, in the early scary days of a pandemic. This is embarrassing but I remember trying to calculate how my salary compared to the cost of the frozen yogurt machine in the New York office. Rosie Gray, former politics reporter: I returned to BuzzFeed in 2019 after working for the Atlantic for a couple years. I had really missed the atmosphere and energy I remembered from BuzzFeed’s heyday. But it was clear right off the bat that things had changed a lot. Even before I officially started, there was a round of layoffs. Things felt less freewheeling and more tense. This was the year we unionized, which was so important considering what happened the next year. 2020 is when it really started to get dicey. First Ben announced he was leaving for the Times, right before the Iowa caucuses. That really threw us on the politics team — we were all really angry, not so much at the concept of Ben leaving at all, but that he would check out at the most awkward moment possible. Then obviously the pandemic hit soon after and it was chaos. We fought for the work-share agreement instead of layoffs, and I’m still really proud that the union was able to save those jobs at that time. Even if it didn’t last. My memory of 2021 to 2022 is basically of a place that was struggling to find its footing at all. By the time they offered buyouts last year, I was ready to leave. It wasn’t the same place I had loved so much. Clarissa-Jan Lim, senior reporter: I’d always heard that Asian employees at BuzzFeed would get mistaken for one another. Towards the end of 2021 when people started trickling back into the office and traveling to New York for summits with their respective desks, that happened to me, twice , in the span of a week. Two different white men at BuzzFeed News confused me for two different Asian women in our newsroom. Only one apologized! Sam Henig, former executive editor and interim editor-in-chief: When I led the search for a new Editor-in-Chief last year, Karolina [Waclawiak] wrote in her memo that she wanted BuzzFeed News to embrace being “a little chaotic.” She was the perfect person to lead BuzzFeed News into its next chapter, to bring back that fun crazy energy from the early Ben Smith days — the kind of delight that spills onto the page. Given Karolina’s invigorating editorial vision and the strong plan we’d worked on with colleagues across the company to increase and diversify revenue, I left in the fall thinking that some of the best days for BuzzFeed News were still ahead. Scaachi Koul, senior culture writer: Near the end, I felt a little like Chicken Little. I was telling everyone at work, “I think something bad’s about to happen.” I have, historically, been right about everything, but I’ll tell you I wasn’t thrilled to be right about this one. The thing that worried me the most was our travel budget disappeared practically overnight. Our earnings reports, now abundantly public , were looking grim. They changed the granola in the office to corn flakes. This , I thought, spells doom . But the tough thing about working in media is that a lot of things are doom-lite, and then the real doom comes and all you can think is: I can’t believe I was right about this . Zia Thompson, audience engagement editor: One Monday in April, our office manager said Wednesday’s lunch would be from a “cutting-edge, robotics-powered mobile pizza restaurant created by a team of former SpaceX engineers.” I normally would’ve stayed home, but I was very intrigued by the idea of robot pizza. That Wednesday, I made the trek to the office and at lunch, I ate a pizza slice so mediocre, that had I not known it was digitally printed, I would’ve guessed it was. The next day, BuzzFeed News shut down. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: There’s actually one thing that my old boss Michael Rusch, who went by “Weed Dude” online, said to me that stuck with me over the years, and was the first thing I thought of when I found out BuzzFeed News was being shut down. He said something to the effect of “I’m asking you to leave your newspaper job to get on a rocket ship. The thing about rocket ships is that they go fast, but the ride can come to an end very unexpectedly. BuzzFeed might last a year, it might last five, it might last a century, we just don’t know.” I really appreciate the poetic foreshadowing of a guy who went by “Weed Dude” online telling me in 2015 that BuzzFeed might abruptly stop like a rocket one day, and then a SpaceX rocket blew up the day BuzzFeed News was getting shut down…. on 4/20/2023. The Investigations desk in the New York office Clarissa-Jan Lim, senior reporter: I wasn’t here for the golden years when people were just throwing money around, but I think that spirit of adventure continued even when the purse strings grew tighter and tighter. I went to Charleston for a week just to see if there was an angle to pursue on a topic I was reporting on. Days before I traveled to Michigan to cover the midterm elections, I wrote about an Air Force plane drawing a dick in the sky. You could write the most ridiculous headline and your editor would be like “That’s the one.” Julia Reinstein, senior reporter: I believe that was actually one of three separate stories that three of us wrote about sky dicks. We never let a sky dick go unreported. David Mack, senior reporter: I have never had as much freedom and fun doing anything in my life. In 8.5 years, I never had a single idea rejected. Nothing was off-limits. They sent me to a poppers factory , for fuck’s sake! I wrote a stupid photo story about Trump sitting in a truck on the White House lawn, turned to my editor, Tom Namako, next to me and said, “You have to trust me. You need to publish this.” And he did! It was such a viral hit that the very next day BuzzFeed turned it into a children’s book. And I got a cut. It was nuts. Where else would do that? I still have a few hundred copies under my bed in boxes. I give signed copies to friends when they have kids. I may never have a better job. Matt Berman, former politics editor: My child will not stop crying if I don’t repeatedly read him David’s Trump truck book. Zoe Tillman, former politics reporter : I loved that we had the freedom to write the way we actually talked to each other and to be honest with readers. It built trust. One of my favorite headlines was “ There Was Drama At Court Today And Maybe It Involved Mueller’s Investigation But Who Knows .” Tom Warren, investigative reporter: It’s quite reasonable that businesses don’t spend unlimited amounts chasing stories. But for many years BuzzFeed inverted that rule. It meant you were never limited by resource, only by your imagination. We did world-beating investigations that freed people from prison and changed laws. Professionally we won a swath of awards — but the thing I’ll really take with me is that I made friends for life. The experience of working here, whilst sometimes frustrating and often stressful, was a dream come true. The rest of the news business looks insipid and gray in comparison. Clockwise from top: Yemile Bucay, Brandon Wall, Sara Yasin, and Rosalind Adams attend the Committee to Protect Journalists annual International Press Freedom Award reception in 2021.

Megha Rajagopalan, Alison Killing, and Christo Buschek accept the Pulitzer Prize for International Reporting at Columbia University in New York City on Jun. 25, 2022. Monica Mark, former West Africa reporter: In April 2015, I got an email from BuzzFeed’s foreign editor Miriam Elder, asking if I’d be interested in talking about what it was like to become part of the World team — “we're all about allowing travel and creativity and a range of stories” is how she described it, which doesn’t even begin to do justice to the wild, creative ride that was the next five years I spent as BuzzFeed News’ first Africa correspondent. I got to cover things no one else was doing at the time, and even some things I haven’t seen anywhere else since. I mean, I have yet to see someone explaining inflation in a West African nation entirely using GIFs. Like everyone else on the amazing World team, I also got to break news that left legacy media eating dust, like on the Special Forces raid gone wrong in Niger . And I got to write longform stories about crazy periods in West African history that wracked up a couple of million — millions! — of views. I just don’t think there’s anywhere else on the internet that political stories about Africa are getting that many eyeballs! Honestly, I still get emotional thinking about what this tiny World desk team achieved in such a short time. Amber Jamieson, internet culture editor: We always treated young people as people, which frankly most publications don’t. After a school shooting in Santa Fe, Texas, I reached out to some teens who survived and had been posting on Twitter to see if they would meet up for a chat. They said sure, as long as it wasn’t at their school, where a shooting had occurred three days earlier. I said of course not, and we met at a local park. They told me the TV networks told them they could only film an interview in front of the school because their equipment couldn’t move — I knew the network had multiple teams there and it was painfully clear that they just wanted these traumatized teens, who'd never interacted with the media previously, to cry on camera. We always made sure that teens knew they had control over their own story. Claudia Koerner, deputy director breaking news: In the immediate aftermath of the Uvalde school shooting, we sent out a push alert and tweet that the cops had fucked up. It was the truth, everyone was thinking it, but we actually got to say it. Breaking news can be such a punishing job, but that ability to just tell the truth made me proud to do it at BuzzFeed News. Ben King, art director: We had so much leeway to do so many fun and incredibly stupid things, and I really think we did a lot to push both what was possible and expected of an online news outlet. Personally, it was the range of work we did, as well as the absolutely furious pace, that made me love it so much. On a given week, we might be working on a massive investigation, setting up a celebrity photo shoot, designing a map or infographic for a breaking news event, or getting FOIA’d documents from the Mueller investigation at 6:30 p.m. on a Monday and scrambling to get a story up. Maybe one of the best ways I can sum up what we did: One day during the run-up to the 2016 election, Saeed Jones told me he was looking to publish a piece of satire by James Hannaham . The story was written as Trump’s notes to himself for a speech, which (in the way it was submitted) wouldn't really translate very well to our CMS. At the time, we had this kid, Mark Davis, freelancing for us, who had previously worked at Font Bureau as a type designer. He arrives at the office around 10 a.m., and the first thing I said to him was, “Today you’re designing a font based on Donald Trump’s handwriting .” And he did! And we published Hannaham’s piece using that font, then made the font available for anyone to download. It was all terribly stupid, and after Trump won, the joke was significantly less funny. But it was a tremendous experience, and something I can’t imagine any other news outlet doing. Kenneth Bachor, photo editor: BuzzFeed News was a dream job for me. Bouncing ideas off editors and writers at BuzzFeed News was a pleasure because I knew I wasn’t going to be judged — it felt nice to collaborate and feel comfortable, which is sometimes not the easiest feeling to have in a newsroom. We did a feature on male sex dolls and their owners. We had behind-the-scenes access to a sex toy manufacturer in California and assigned photographer Skyler Dahan to spend a day with the male sex dolls — the story was an SPD58 Medal Finalist this year. Katie Notopoulos, senior tech reporter: “Punching above our weight” is something I would hear bosses say or I’d see in descriptions of BuzzFeed News. I never saw it that way; I think we punched exactly at our weight. Despite what may have been Ben’s dream, we never competed with the New York Times or legacy outlets; we were always playing an entirely different game. Not better or worse, just different. We succeeded when we looked for stories in places no one else was looking precisely because we couldn’t compete with legacy outlets on the main story of the day. You couldn’t just report The News, you had to be creative, you had to be nimble. I think that’s why so many former BuzzFeed News people have succeeded at big legacy outlets — they have that creativity ingrained in them, plus that institutional power behind them. It’s like, If you thought they were good before, wait till people actually answer their phone calls. Joel Anderson, former sports and national reporter: It was the only time in the world that I’d worked somewhere with the money to really and truly unleash its talent and resources. I almost hate to name any of them. Tracy Clayton and Heben Nigatu showed what was possible with podcasting. I remember when Quinta Brunson was doing funny little videos for us. Saeed Jones. Albert Samaha and Melissa Segura literally got people freed from prison, among other things. Katie Baker. Ashley Ford. Miriam Elder. Lisa Tozzi. John Stanton. Andrew Kaczynski. Mike Hayes. Katie Notopoulos and Ellie Hall were genius at finding weird stories from the internet and explaining why they mattered offline. Jessica Garrison. I should stop because I’ll be sick about overlooking more folks. I also had a deep appreciation for the folks who excelled at making lists and videos, because I realized that, for a long time, they paid down some of our bills. I’ll forever be grateful about what we built there, and really bummed that it didn’t last. Sarah Mimms, former DC editor: I spent five years at BuzzFeed News and left in 2022 during the previous downsizing, in a decision that broke my heart. It was a real blessing to be covering politics at BuzzFeed News during the Trump presidency; we were a “failing pile of garbage” with a lot of freedom that made a potato version of Sean Spicer and also covered an insurrection and exposed sexual harassment on the Hill — we could do both. I did the best work of my career with brilliant and funny journalists who worked hard and actually bothered to be nice to each other. I met lifelong friends, journalists I deeply admire, and my fiancé all in that newsroom. I don’t expect I’ll work anywhere like it again. Kate Aurthur, former entertainment reporter: As one of the Olds working at BuzzFeed News, I learned so much from my younger colleagues that I’ll take with me forever. I learned how to experiment with my own writing, and to be fearless. And if BuzzFeed News in LA was sometimes treated like an annoying appendage, it was worth it that our second temporary office was at Sunset Gower, and Shonda Rhimes and the cast of Scandal would trudge by every week for their table reads! Ema O’Connor, former politics reporter: I was really trusted as a young person to write incredibly ambitious stories. They took risks like that, they would say, “Yeah, this is a story that needs to be told.” I was able to do what I wanted to do and there was so much freedom. Ben Smith, former editor-in-chief: We loved news and weren’t snobs. Tom Namako hides under his desk as the newsroom sings happy birthday to him. Sara Yasin, former managing editor: BuzzFeed News was the one place where you could just really and truly write any story, and it was celebrated and treated just as important as a huge investigation. The obsessiveness we put into getting stories right — whether it was Blippi or FinCen Files , we weren’t scared of picking up the weird and wonderful corners of the internet. It’s kind of magical to be a large group that’s on the same wavelength in that way. It’s the most fearless I’ve ever been professionally, because I felt like everyone on staff had each other’s backs even when they didn’t agree. Cody Corrall, audience engagement editor: I was one of a small group of news staffers hired during the pandemic. For the first time in my professional life, I was able to be taken seriously at a national publication while being based in Chicago because of the expansion of remote work (protections which would later be cemented in our union contract). Nobody at BuzzFeed News cared where I went to college or if I worked at a “prestigious” enough job before coming here. There was simply no ego. Expanding access to remote employees just showed how much talent is at our fingertips if we stop honing in on New York and LA as the bastions of “real” journalism: incredible designers, audience editors, and reporters from all over were able to get their foot in the door because of that. Zia Thompson, audience engagement editor: An internet comment section is a notoriously awful place to be, but every now and again, while I’m trudging through the mud, I’ll see people write comments that fill me with so much pride: “Thank you for bringing attention to this.” “Thanks for saying the quiet part out loud.” “This was so interesting and really made me think.” Reading those things, knowing that even just one person found affirmation, meaning, or understanding in what we were doing made it all worth it. This is one of — if not the only — places where we could communicate, both in reporting and in social copy, how normal people talked. We were serious when we needed to be and fun whenever we could be and it just worked. The audience team got to call it like it was and never minced words. To be “the smart friend in your pocket” was our objective and I believe we achieved that. It’s just now hitting me that there probably won’t be another place that will let me make a dick joke about Jeff Bezos’s rocket on TikTok, write thirsty copy for a story about hoochie daddy shorts, or come up with clever punny headlines for the homepage whenever I want, and that makes me sad. Brandon Wall, director of newsroom strategy and experiments: It’s important to realize how many things in journalism that are now taken for common were pioneered by BuzzFeed News, particularly #TeamNewsApp and News Curation. The way news organizations approached push alerts changed almost overnight with the launch of the BuzzFeed News app and our strategy of sending conversational alerts (that didn’t feel like copy-pastes of headlines! What a concept!) about stories that our readers actually cared about — not what some editor thought was important. We were breaking down complicated stories into visual, bite-size chunks that’s now pretty common all the way back in 2015. We were building direct relations with our readers (we had a BuzzFeed News App Facebook Group!). And as alumni of these teams moved on to other news organizations, our core ideas and approaches spread. It’s easy to forget just how stuffy and boring receiving the news on the internet was in 2014 and 2015. There’s one push alert we did in particular that came the day after the January 6 riots. It had been an extremely an extremely long 24 hours, when Trump suddenly tweeted a video that sure seemed like he was finally conceding the 2020 election. As director, I was very confident in my language, but figured I should probably get somebody else to sign off on saying “bullshit election fraud claims”... shareable culpability and all that. I sent the GOAT Tom Namako two options for the wording. Tom gave no pushback, but did have a very classic Tom Flourish Edit that made the push pop all the more. And so that’s how this went out to the world: Megha Rajagopalan, former investigative reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner: I just basically met Alison Killing, and we decided we were going to do this project — nobody really ever questioned that it had some potential, even though at the outset it must have sounded nuts, like, I’m going to work with an architect and a programmer to find mass internment camps in China. I don’t know that most newsrooms would have let that go. I was at SXSW with Alison, we told Ben Smith about the project, and he was like, “Sounds really cool.” I think it’s probably a function of the level of trust editors put in reporters at BuzzFeed News, which I think would be harder for early and mid-career reporters to gain elsewhere. And then when Mark Schoofs became editor-in-chief, he immediately took an interest in the project and knew that it was going to be meaningful. The day before the Pulitzer was announced, a few of us got an email that BuzzFeed had entered us, and I was like, Oh, OK . I still didn’t think we had a chance, I assumed the FinCEN Files , also from BuzzFeed News, would win. The next day we had a team lunch in London where it did not come up. I went home and basically found out when Mark Schoofs called me and I was like “ What?? ” They were announcing it on a livestream, and I wasn’t watching. My husband was actually watching in the other room, so he found out before me. Anna Betts, reporter: BuzzFeed News was the first-ever newsroom I worked in as a full-time reporter. I was so nervous and had major impostor syndrome as I was going to be working with so many journalists and editors that I had looked up to for so long. As soon as I started in 2022, I was welcomed with open arms by everyone in the newsroom and straight away treated as a part of the BuzzFeed News family. I couldn’t believe the amount of freedom I was given as a new reporter when it came to the stories I got to cover. For four months, I was given the opportunity to solely focus on an investigative story about the cruise industry that I was writing with the legendary Tom Warren, along with the best editing team: Karolina [Waclawiak], Mary Ann [Georgantopoulos], Mark [Yarm] and Jason [Wells]. Working on this project made me a better reporter and cemented my love for journalism and storytelling. I will forever cherish those months working with the dream team on such an impactful piece and embracing the chaos that came with it. Pranav Dixit, tech reporter: I joined BuzzFeed News in 2016 as a correspondent on the Tech desk based in India. We never had an India bureau for News, but my boss, Mat Honan, had the foresight to realize that American tech companies weren’t just changing people’s lives in the US but around the world. BuzzFeed’s tech coverage needed to reflect that. We brought BuzzFeed’s unique brand of tech coverage to India, asking tough questions of American tech companies as they raced to hook a billion Indians coming online for the first time to their products. Scaachi Koul, senior culture writer: I believe in nothing, but I always believed in the work we did. Karolina gave me a kind of latitude I never thought I would get as a writer. She was my editor for more than seven years, and in that time, we did so much weird, cool shit: We profiled Lil Pump and Courtney Stodden and Jhumpa Lahiri and Trisha Paytas . We wrote about Trump with the same seriousness that we wrote about Ned from the Try Guys . We wrote reported mega-features on plastic surgery, QAnon, the weight loss industrial complex, and white supremacy. Then, the next day, we’d write about how Friends sucks . Karolina would text me in the middle of the night about some freakish Netflix softcore (using this term lightly) porn film and the next morning I’d be watching it at 8 a.m. and then we’d write something insane and a literal million people would read it. I’m devastated about a lot, but high on my list are all the stories I still wanted to do, that we still wanted to do, that we can’t anymore. Karolina only got a few months as editor-in-chief, and I was excited about the future, how we’d break and reshape conversations about culture and politics and the internet. These stories will live elsewhere, I know, but their conceptions and conceits are a testament to this bizarre, sometimes hectic, sometimes languid, always expansive place. The more I think about the work we did, the more this closure is solidified in my own mind as a mistake. But so it goes: We’re all fuzzy little pappi getting blown off a dandelion stem by a strong breeze. We’ll all land somewhere, and we’ll pollinate anew. Karolina Waclawiak, editor-in-chief: Thinking about how much range this newsroom had will always stop me in my tracks. The talent! The breadth of reporting! There were no limits to what we’d publish each day, even as our budgets were shrinking. Because we had this massive platform, we had the ability to change the conversation online with any given story on any given day. It was really awe-inspiring to watch things go viral and to be the guiding hand for what everyone was talking about that day because millions of people would read the stories we published. I would come up with outlandish ideas and the writers would be game for it. Writers would come up with wild ideas and I trusted them enough to just go with it. Hitting publish on something was both exhilarating and terrifying — this could change everything or we could be run off the internet. I remember waking up from time to time thinking, How is it that I — and we — get to define what’s important in America? It feels like a fever dream. ● Reported by Katie Notopoulos and Ellie Hall The New York newsroom poses for a photo in 2016. BuzzFeed News",2025-06-24T17:48:37.398449+00:00
BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/karolinawaclawiak/a-final-editors-note,news,,A Final Editor’s Note,4,525,14,5,"Today, BuzzFeed News goes dark. BuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief If I’m going to be honest, I’m not a fan of writing obituaries. It’s hard to quantify the impact of someone’s life in a short space, so it feels nearly impossible to capture the impact of an entire newsroom in a final editor’s note. It’s staggering to think about what BuzzFeed News was able to accomplish in just over a decade of existence, which was punctuated by countless journalism awards, including a Pulitzer Prize in 2021 . Our reporting led to the release of innocent people from prison , changed laws , and held power to account , all while making people laugh by pointing out the absurdity of life online and making others very, very angry about seemingly innocuous things . We helped expose R. Kelly’s alleged sex cult ; published a searing letter from a Stanford assault victim that sparked a national conversation on campus sexual assault; ran the first interview with an actor who shared his account of an alleged assault by actor Kevin Spacey ; created a seismic cultural moment across the world with the words “ millennial burnout ”; and documented a series of assassinations in the UK with alleged ties to the Kremlin, which became a Pulitzer finalist and a stirring docuseries . We could do it all — and we did it with ease. Obituaries written about us in other publications have noted that we were the first newsroom to treat internet life as real life, which led to a sea change at legacy media companies. Our alums are scattered across every major media organization in the world. At first it made us nervous to have other outlets constantly coming for our talent, but then it made us proud. Those reporters and editors took what they learned at BuzzFeed News — what I like to call “chaotic good” — and changed the DNA of wherever they went. We recently published an oral history by the people who powered this pirate ship of “intense but friendly” creative geniuses that is well worth a read. It’s hardly definitive — there’s just too much ground to cover. But what I can say without hesitation is that it’s been an honor to work alongside colleagues who were passionately committed to telling the truth and making people feel seen and heard, all while mentoring and supporting each other in the process. We were all coming up together and there will never be any other newsroom like it. I’m grateful I had a chance to be a part of BuzzFeed News for over seven years. And for a short time, I had the incredible opportunity to be at the helm. Thank you so much for being our supporters and readers. Knowing we had the possibility of effecting change kept us going — especially during the most overwhelming days inside the news cycle. Our archives aren’t going away and our stories will remain as true and meaningful as the day we published them. Even though we’re shutting down, the internet lasts forever — so in a way, we will too. — Karolina Waclawiak, Editor-in-Chief  BuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief",2025-06-24T17:48:38.002377+00:00

How do you return to regular life after being Zac Efron’s girlfriend? BuzzFeed Staff Speaking of divorce albums, Ariana Grande was first linked to her future husband in early 2020, when TMZ published footage of her making out with “a rando at a bar.” That “rando” turned out to be a real estate agent called Dalton Gomez. Ari and Dalton announced their engagement in December 2020 and married in May the following year. However, the marriage did not last the test of time, and their split was made public in July 2023 . Ariana has not talked publicly about the divorce; however, her Eternal Sunshine album included a number of hints as to what may have gone down… J.Lo is our ultimate lover girl, so you better believe she’s tried dating a normie. Jennifer hit it off with Casper Smart in 2011 when he was a backup dancer on her tour, and they wound up getting engaged the following year. During their on-and-off relationship, J.Lo and Casper faced a lot of scrutiny over their 18-year age-gap, and by 2016 , they’d called things off for good. Earlier this year, Casper was charged with operating an illegal marijuana grow operation at his home in LA. Meanwhile, J.Lo is still J.Lo. OK, this might be one of my favorite A-list/normie romances to date. In June 2020, Zac was living in Australia and met a local girl called Vanessa Valladares while she was working at a coffee shop. Like something out of a book, the pair struck up a romantic relationship and were photographed together numerous times — she even celebrated his 33rd birthday with him in October that year. However, by April 2021, People had reported their split, saying that Zac had been the one to end things. Reese met talent agent Jim Toth at a friend’s house in early 2010 . She was seen introducing him to her famous pals in May that year, and by December, they were engaged. They married in 2011, and in 2012, they welcomed a son named Tennessee. Reese and Jim announced their divorce just days before their 12th wedding anniversary in 2023. A source told People at the time that the pair had become “two very different people,” describing Reese as “headstrong and focused,” while Jim was more “laidback.” Lady Gaga was first linked with her talent agent beau in 2017. Gaga and Christian Carino made a number of red carpet appearances together and even got engaged. Notably, in 2017, Gaga said that many of her past relationships seemed to end whenever she hit a big career milestone. Fast forward to February 2019, and, amidst the global hype for A Star Is Born , People confirmed that Gaga and Christian had split. A month later, she won an Oscar , and now she’s happily engaged to another non-famous guy, Michael Polansky . Welcome back, Ari! After meeting him as one of her backup dancers in 2015, Ariana dated Ricky Alvarez for about a year. He wasn’t famous at the time, although he soon found himself in the headlines as the mystery man standing next to Ari in the infamous 2015 video of her licking a donut . The pair broke up in July 2016, and while the relationship may not have been that long, Ricky was one of Ari’s select few exes who got a shoutout on her 2018 hit, “thank u, next.” What a legacy. For years, it felt like people were always asking, “Who’s the random guy that Sydney Sweeney is engaged to?” Well, that random guy is called Jonathan Davino, and as it happens, they’re not engaged anymore. Sydney and Jonathan were first linked in 2018 and got engaged in March 2022. The Euphoria star was always very private about her relationship, although she did once deny rumors that Jonathan was “the heir of a pizza company.” (“He’s a business guy. He’s from Chicago,” she clarified to Glamour UK .) Reports that the couple had split surfaced in March this year, and in May, she confirmed that she’s single . From one newly single actor to another, Jessica Alba filed for divorce from Cash Warren in February this year, ending their 16-year marriage. For context, Jessica and her future husband met on the set of Fantastic Four more than 20 years ago when Cash was working as an assistant behind the camera. They tied the knot in 2008 and share three children together. Rumors of their split first started bubbling up in early January, and Jessica confirmed the news in a statement a few weeks later. Britney Spears met Sam Asghari on the set of her “Slumber Party” music video in 2016 when she was one of the most famous people on the planet and he was cast to play her love interest. They went official with their relationship in January 2017, and in the years that followed, Sam was by Britney’s side as she navigated her conservatorship battle. After her conservatorship ended , Britney and Sam tied the knot in June 2022. However, just 14 months later, sources confirmed that they’d split . OK, this is more of a bonus mention, because whether or not Joe Alwyn was a normie when he and Taylor started dating in 2016 is up for debate. However, it’s certainly fair to say that he wasn’t that famous at the time. During the six-year relationship, Taylor talked ( and sang ) openly about how Joe’s “normal way of living” helped her change her viewpoint on fame. “The idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song ‘Peace’ is taking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?” she told Rolling Stone in 2020. As we now know, Taylor and Joe’s “normal” way of life eventually stopped cutting it and the couple split in April 2023. Today, she’s in a comparatively far more public relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce, and Joe is certainly more famous than he was a decade ago.",2025-06-24T17:48:39.233761+00:00

BuzzFeed Staff In 2014, E. Lockhart took young adult readers by storm with her novel We Were Liars . It's a haunting, twist-filled novel about a wealthy, seemingly perfect family that summers on their own private island. At the center is Cadence Sinclair Eastman, a teenage girl struggling to remember the events of one traumatic summer that left her with memory loss, chronic migraines, and a sense that something is deeply wrong.  She returns to the island two years later and reunites with her closest companions — her cousins Johnny and Mirren, and Gat, the boy she once loved. Together, they were known as The Liars, a tight-knit group bonded by rebellion, idealism, and a desire to escape the toxic patterns of their privileged family.  As Cadence tries to untangle what really happened that summer, the story peels back layers of secrets, grief, and denial. Told in lyrical, almost fairy tale-like prose, the novel builds to a devastating twist that redefines everything. It’s a novel about denial, grief, and the lies we tell ourselves to protect what we think we love, and the people we think we can’t live without. Now, more than 10 years after its initial release, the popular psychological family drama has been adapted into an 8-episode TV series, thanks to showrunners Julie Plec ( The Vampire Diaries ) and Carina Adly Mackenzie ( Roswell, New Mexico ). And the world of The Liars was brought to life by series stars Emily Alyn Lind (Cadence), Shubham Maheshwari (Gat), Esther McGregor (Mirren), and Joseph Zada (Johnny). In honor of the show's release, I interviewed the author to learn more about the adaptation process. Here are some of the behind-the-scenes details, straight from E. Lockhart's mouth: EL: Well, We Were Liars has been in development since the book came out in 2014. First, it was for a feature. It had five different writers and two different directors. Then it was in development for TV at another [streaming service] that didn't end up going, and then it landed with Julie Plec and Carina Mackenzie. So to be truthful, all the upsetting versions I have already read [laughs], and it was really nice to hand the book over to two people who really loved the book. They were really connected to the book and to the themes of the book. And, of course, there's so much to adapt when you make something into a television show. But they were very much wanting to convey the core meaning of the book on television. BF: Wow, I didn't know it went through so many screening processes. EL: Yeah, development hell [laughs]. EL: The novel, as you know, is a first-person story, very much from Cadence's perspective, and she is an entitled, imaginative, passionate heiress, right? So it's a limited perspective. She also has amnesia — even more limited perspective — and the show holds on to all of that. It also fleshes out stories of secondary characters and gives some room to their perspectives, most importantly, the character of Gat, who is her love interest. So the Sinclair family, they're all old money, white Democrats, and Gat and his Uncle Ed are middle-class New Yorkers of Indian descent, kind of intellectual, political, all of that. And we had a writer's room, as you do on a television show, and one of the things that [Julie] Plec and [Carina Adly] Mackenzie did was bring in not just a diverse group of writers, as you might have on any show, but also four writers of Indian descent who had all kinds of cool skills as storytellers. They had comedy chops, thriller chops, all of that, but they were also generous with their lived experience, and so they fleshed out the characters of Gat and Ed with a lot more nuance and authenticity. You hear a lot more from Gat and Ed in the show than you do in the book, and you understand their perspectives and how things feel to them much more deeply. EL: They did not always agree with each other. That was also great, because it's not a monolithic point of view. EL: There was a development room for this show before Plec went off to write the pilot. I was in that room for 10 weeks, and that was really a room for conversations about what all the options were for making this into a television show. How was it going to be best structured? What were the pitfalls that we wanted to avoid? What were the most important themes? How could these characters be fleshed out and still stay true to the spirit of the book, and so on? But once that was done, they went away and created the real writer's room and wrote the show. I came in just to write the finale. So I came into the writer's room for two weeks, worked on the finale structure with the writer's room, and then went off to do my writing. I wrote a second novel in the We Were Liars universe that's called Family of Liars , and that novel is the story of what the moms in We Were Liars did back when they were teenagers. It basically answers the question, ""Why are these women such hot messes?"" And so Plec and Mackenzie created new narratives for those characters, but it was always true to the story that they had read in Family of Liars . So they built those characters from Family of Liars into these complicated women that you see on screen, and I think that it's a multi-generational family soap. EL: There was an open casting call on my Instagram; it was on Carina's; it was also in Backstage magazine, and some other places that actors might look, basically for anybody who was interested in playing one of those four lead teenage characters. It was only an open call for those four parts. I don't know exactly what they sent in, but let's say it was a headshot and a résumé that they had to send to the casting directors, and then the casting directors sorted through all of those, and we got thousands of submissions, and they invited people who had maybe the right look, maybe the right vibe, maybe some interesting experience, to send in audition videos, and one of those people was Shubham Maheshwari, who plays Gat. He had never been in a show before. He'd been in student films. He was graduating from college with a degree in economics and ready to go to work in an office. He sent in his picture, or whatever. Then he sent in a video. The video was good enough that we saw it. We liked him. He kept coming back. He came back, you know, approximately 1,000 times. He got better every time. He was auditioning from his dorm room in college, and in the end, we chemistry read, shoved together with, I think, three or four other guys that we were interested in. I remember there was a little group chat going on — hopefully we weren't typing while the actors were auditioning — but in between actors and chemistry reads, I remember writing, ""I'm so relieved to see Shubham."" I'd seen him so many times, but I'd seen all these guys a lot of times, but I just felt like we were coming home [with him]. You know? Instead of people who didn't feel like Gat, I felt like, ""Oh, he's here."" I just remember this feeling of like, ""Oh, okay. He's really got it. He's got this character. He understands this guy, and he's really magical on screen."" I hope you feel the same. EL: Oh, yeah! And with Emily Alyn Lind, she was one of the first actresses we saw in a callback. I can remember her callback very vividly. She was stunning and witty and complicated and relatable and entitled and smart, and she was kind of all the things, but it was the very beginning of our process. And so we just kept seeing people. We saw many wonderful, wonderful people, but we did kind of keep returning to Emily Lind, and we never stopped talking about her. I think we just kind of couldn't believe that we had already found Cadence so early in the process. And finally, we were like, ""Okay, it's always been her."" So, that was a different kind of journey. She's a very experienced actor. She has been in a lot of things. She's been working since she was quite young. She's worked with big movie stars. She's been a series regular on TV. So, I think we also knew that Emily would be a good scene partner for Shub as he was learning the ropes, you know? We knew he would have the scene support with her. And I know from talking to him that she was very generous, encouraging, and open for rehearsal. She took the time to make him feel at ease and get to know him. I think that really paid off. EL: I didn't have anyone in mind. We never got... We had directors attached at different points, but we never got to the casting [portion of it]. EL: In Episode 7, all The Liars are tipsy, and they're alone on the island in this big house, with no staff, no parents, no littles, nobody else is there, and they get into the whiskey. At one point in the script, it says that Johnny (played by Joseph Zada) slides across the dining room floor in his socks and knocks a statue over. When the other liars are like, ""What are you doing?"" He's like, ""I'm doing the Tom Cruise Risky Business slide."" And that's all it said in the script. Joe was like, ""I can do better than that."" So, at his initiation, he planned out this iconic Tom Cruise dance number homage, which he does, in a pink shirt and all that. It is super, super delightful and funny. And it really came from him, his joy in performing, and his understanding of this character, and how this character goes all out to the max, even when he's alone in a room. That was just such a treat to see him bring it. It was also the middle of the night. We're all tired. We've all been doing night shoots, we're exhausted, you know? And there he is just dancing his heart out. It was great! EL: Nobody has asked me that. That's a good question. BF: Thank you! EL: I think a lot of my books, We Were Liars , included, ask the question, ""How do you live with yourself, and what do you do if you have done something terrible?"" I think this is a very relatable question. We don't all do things that are as terrible as what they do, in We Were Liars , or as terrible as what we see in lots of TV shows, or that's in lots of my books, but we often are filled with regret or shame about something that we have done. And the question is, ""Do you bury it? Do you confront it? Do you forgive yourself? Should you forgive yourself? Can you make any kind of reparation? Or, you know, what should you do?"" In the last scene between Johnny and Cadence, when they're standing out on the porch of Cuddledown. He says, ""You can go on and live a life where you do good things, and that doesn't erase the bad, but the good will be good, right? You can go on and do those good things and live a good life, and I cannot."" That's something I hope people take away: There's no one answer to anything, but we're wrestling with that question, and I think the book wrestles with it and the show wrestles with it. And if people key into that scene, they'll really understand what the heart of the book and the show is. EL: Nobody wants to watch underage people making out [laughs]. If that's what you want to watch, you are not my friend. So, we cast actors who are all fully of age, and we wanted them to look a little bit older. Also, it's a sophisticated show with sophisticated themes, and so it made more sense for them not to be two years apart in the two different time periods, but to be only a single year apart. EL: Everything was kind of bigger, brighter, more luxurious, more beautiful...grander than I ever imagined. But in Episode 4, I think it's 4, there's the lemon hunt. The lemon hunt is actually in my novel Family of Liars , which is the prequel to We Were Liars . This lemon hunt that they do every year, where they hide 100 lemons and a single lime, and there are prizes. It's in the evening, and everyone wears white and yellow clothes, and they have lemony food, and then they go out with these baskets. In Family of Liars , it's really, honestly, just an excuse for people to find each other in the dark and make out. In We Were Liars, the TV show, they brought the lemon hunt into the first story. The first day, when I saw the set decoration and the costumes for the lemon hunt, and everyone in their costumes — I had seen the costumes before, but they were through emails and different people in different outfits at different times. To see the whole family in these incredible yellow clothes and carrying these baskets and seeing just this incredible display of beautiful lemon-themed food laid out on lemony tablecloths, that was a real moment where I was like, ""Wow, this is something that used to exist only in my head, and now I'm standing in the middle of it."" EL: Well, in writing, I think one thing that's really different about being a novelist as compared to being an actor is that I can be very vulnerable on the page, but I really only have to do it one day. I just have to nail it the one day. And in the case of We Were Liars , the novel, it was pretty late in the process that I really got the emotion of the ending of the story onto the page. My editor kept kind of coming back with the last few pages and saying, ""Go deeper."" Finally, one day, I kind of, I don't know why, but I could do it, and I did something that I was proud of, and that's what you see in the book. Actors, they do it all day, every day, on demand. They come back, and they do it again the next day. These actors... There was one day when we filmed them around the Scrabble table, and all four of them cried for about five hours straight while filming, like they just never stopped crying. I just felt so amazed at their skill and their generosity of spirit and their vulnerability as actors. I really understood that. The vulnerability is the same, but as a novelist, you are doing that protected, at home, one time. EL: I do not think the meaning of a work of literature or a work of filmmaking lies in the author. EL: There was a huge resurgence on TikTok in 2020, during the pandemic. I think the biggest reason that happened was that this is a book full of big feelings, and some people threw the book across the room. Other people sobbed their eyes out. Other people had some other kind of reaction, but it was always a big reaction, and I think especially during the pandemic, when people were isolated from the big feelings, from the drama with their friends, from the big romances that crash and burn or swoop them off their feet, they were really craving that big amount of emotional feeling from their books. And that was also true of books like Song of Achilles , or They Both Die at the End . Those are also books that became very popular at that time through TikTok videos, because they made people feel, and so I think that's what our show is offering, which maybe is different from other YA shows, or even Succession -type rich family politics type of shows. I love both of those shows. Our show is going to be really, really emotional. And I think people are looking to feel. We can have fun all we want, watching TikTok videos and Instagram reels, and I do that as much as the next person, but if I'm going to watch a show or read a book and give you eight hours of my time, I want to feel something. EL: I have written a couple pilots for streamers, but none of them have ever been made, so, this is my first piece of filmed television writing. I was on set for all of the filming and had the most amazing time with director Erica Dunton, who did Episodes 7 and 8. It was just a fantastic education in seeing how all these little pieces of a big action set piece that are filmed separately from one another can then be threaded together into a seamless piece of storytelling. We had five different versions of that blue and red dress, some with big, wide skirts; one that was a breakaway; one that the stunt person was going to wear; one that got put on a dummy and lit on fire, and so on. All those happened at different times, and yet, what you see is Emily Lind running through the flames and out onto the lawn. All this took several weeks at all these different points — seamstresses staying up all night, and designer fabric brought in from the US (we were filming in Canada). When you're writing a book, everything is made of words, but when you write a teleplay, you start by making something of words. Then everybody from seamstresses to camera people, to set decoration, to actors, to stunt people, editors, of course, and music supervisors... There are so many components. So, it was really wonderful to see all those come together. Be sure to check out all eight episodes of We Were Liars , which is currently streaming on Prime Video . And to dive even deeper into this domestic drama, you can read E. Lockhart's books, We Were Liars and Family of Liars .",2025-06-24T17:48:42.175639+00:00

There is currently no known cure for ALS, and the life expectancy after diagnosis usually ranges between three and five years, although some people live for decades. Eric and Janell posed hand-in-hand on the red carpet on Wednesday, and a source told Entertainment Tonight that same day that they have been “in an on-and-off relationship ” for more than three years. “Eric asked Janell to be there for him during this time, and she wanted to show up for him,” the insider added. “We are really close. We are great coparents. We really figured out the formula to staying a family, and I think our kids are benefiting greatly from it, and we are as well,” she said, before going into more detail. “I think it’s important to not look at a relationship that ends as a failure. It's just a season. It wasn't a failure. It was a huge success.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniesoteriou/ezra-miller-controversies-comeback-explained,news,,"After Shocking People With An Appearance At Cannes Last Month, Ezra Miller Just Made Another Public Appearance. Here’s Everything There Is To Know.",23,889,12,25,"You may have noticed that Ezra has started to return to the public eye in recent months, and they have now opened up about their many controversies. BuzzFeed Staff After that, Ezra starred in several notable movies, including The Perks of Being a Wallflower , and joined some huge franchises like DC Comics as the Flash, and the Fantastic Beasts series, where they played Dumbledore’s nephew, Credence Barebone. The first arrest was on March 28 , with the police report stating that Ezra became agitated by a group of patrons in a Hawaii bar that were singing karaoke. The actor allegedly shouted obscenities at the group and snatched the microphone from a 23-year-old woman mid-song.  Ezra is then said to have lunged at a man who was playing darts, and was arrested and charged on both counts before being released on $500 bail.  The next day, a local couple in Hawaii filed a temporary restraining order against Ezra, alleging that after the arrest at the bar, Ezra burst into their bedroom and threatened them .  In the police report, Ezra is accused of telling the man: “I will bury you and your slut wife.” It also alleges that Ezra stole the man’s wallet, which contained his bank cards, social security card, and driver’s license, and the woman’s passport.  The following month, Ezra was arrested and taken into custody for second-degree assault, also in Hawaii. This time, they were accused of throwing a chair at a 26-year-old woman, which struck her on the forehead and left a half-inch cut.  Police stated that officers were called to a private residence at around 1:10 a.m. in response to a report that Ezra had become irate after being asked to leave a gathering. Ezra was found at a traffic stop 20 minutes later, where they were arrested before being released from custody just after 4 a.m. Then, in June 2022, the parents of an 18-year-old activist called Gibson Iron Eyes accused Ezra of grooming their child , with rumors that Ezra is leading a cult also circulating online.  At this point, past incidents involving Ezra began to resurface, too, including some troubling interactions with fans — such as choking a woman, and kissing a man seemingly without consent. In the clip, the fan appears to be gearing up for a play fight, at which point Ezra asks: “Did you want to fight?” before grabbing her by the throat and pushing her to the ground. Someone else can be heard shouting: “Whoa, bro! Bro!” with a source telling Variety that it was a “serious altercation.”  Ezra was said to have been escorted from the premises at the time, and ET Canada added that people who claimed to be at the scene had alleged Ezra spat on them and staff members, and also proudly showed off their scars from previous fights. ""Having recently gone through a time of intense crisis, I now understand that I am suffering complex mental health issues and have begun ongoing treatment,"" Ezra said in the statement. ""I want to apologize to everyone that I have alarmed and upset with my past behavior. I am committed to doing the necessary work to get back to a healthy, safe and productive stage in my life.""  In January 2023, Ezra pleaded guilty to unlawfully trespassing in relation to the couple who filed the temporary restraining order, and the burglary charge against Ezra was dropped. Ezra was put on probation for a year, subject to a fine, and ordered to give up alcohol as well as continue seeking mental health treatment. Die My Love stars Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson and was directed by Lynne Ramsay, who directed Ezra in We Need to Talk About Kevin over a decade ago. Ezra and Lynne have remained good friends ever since. Ezra opened up to Italian publication Lo Speciale Giornale when they made another public appearance at a Filming Italy event last week. Explaining that they would “do anything” for Lynne as well as their other friends, Ezra reflected on their years of legal woes and controversies. They said: “When we go through those crucibles, if we can survive, which was up in the air for me, if I'm being real, we then have that capacity to see other people in their crucibles and just to reach towards them… I think that grows more and more rarefied in our world, too.”  ""Like, the capacity to do that, the desire to do that, the willingness to do that,” Ezra went on. “We've become very consumed in notions of perception, self-perception, how we're perceived in the world. I really believe in digging past that and being a friend to people. And the people who did that for me, they have my lifelong devotion.""  “Also, I'm grateful for the revelations of who was not that,” they explained. “When you work in this industry, you'll find yourself in deep, deep relation with a lot of people who do not give a single fuck about you, or your well-being, at all.” Elsewhere in the interview, the actor revealed that they are currently writing a movie with Lynne, which will “likely be the first thing” Ezra does if their Hollywood return materializes.  ""I've been writing a lot, because you can do that in solitude, which has been friendly to me,” they explained.",2025-06-24T17:48:49.429885+00:00

On top of that, Brooklyn also snubbed his dad on Father’s Day , which, if you know how active the Beckhams are on social media, is pretty shocking . The rumored ex in question, Kim Turnbull — whom Romeo is no longer dating — recently denied that she was ever romantically involved with Brooklyn, so who knows. Despite previously saying he’d never taken a cooking class , Brooklyn has remained pretty dedicated to the culinary world. His ongoing chef era has led to an appearance on the Today Show , a web series called Cookin’ with Brooklyn , a bottled Sake brand, a pop-up restaurant, and a hot sauce line called Cloud23.

BuzzFeed Contributor Despite the original Top Gun being released back in 1986, it took nearly 36 years to make Top Gun: Maverick. This was due to the fact that the film was post-poned and shelved multiple times before coming into development due to various conflicts that arose over time, such as fundings and investments being pulled, essential crew members falling through, and the desire to make a relevant, intriguing story to pull back in diehard Top Gun fanatics and to branch out to among other audiences. Development on Blade Runner 2049 dates all the way back to 1999 (still 17 years after), yet was halted various times due to director Ridley Scott's unavailability to direct the sequel, licensing issues, and creating a captivating story to follow the beloved original. While he passed on the job at first, Denis Villeneuve eventually stepped up to take on the sequel to Blade Runner. At the time he was approached around 2015, Villeneuve had just finished his film Sicario and was already beginning production of the 2016 sci-fi thriller, Arrival. Yet, after intense schedule arrangements, Villeneuve reconsidered and Blade Runner 2049 made its way out into the universe in 2017. The delay in making Finding Dory, which was released in 2016 and 13 years after Finding Nemo, was mostly due to story structure and the struggles of centering a film around the initial side-character, Dory. Director Andrew Stanton understood this challenge, but spoke about creating a story around Dory. He stated , ""She was built to be a side character. She was built to be the best sidekick and the comedic foil for a whole movie. When you're the main character of a picture, it means you have to be the character with the big problem that everybody has to be emotionally invested in and has to have things at stake, and so they just invariably end up having to be a little bit more serious. So, the tough part was, 'How do we make Dory even remember that she has issues and that she's changing?"" After establishing the story, it took around two years to complete the animation, which is why the film took so long to be made. Avatar: The Way of Water was released a long time after the original Avatar due to the business of director James Cameron's schedule, the need for increased story development, and the fact that Avatar was originally meant to be a trilogy, not a five-film franchise. Once decided, Cameron explained that it took him four years to write the other four movies, another challenge added in the midst of making the sequel. He also shared how he had to invest in new underwater tech to enhance the reality of the Avatar world, which also took a considerable amount of time. Lastly, filming the actual sequel, Avatar: The Way of Water took three years itself, making it very easy to understand how it took nearly 13 years for the film to release following the original. Despite director Ridley Scott announcing the finished script for the sequel to Gladiator back in 2003, things fell apart quickly when DreamWorks sold its live-action library over to Paramount Pictures in 2006. After that, there wasn't any news on the progress or development of Gladiator II until around 2017 when Scott shared he'd found a way in the story to bring back Russell Crowe, who famously portrayed Maximus Aurelius. Then, it was announced in 2018 by Paramount that the sequel was officially in development, but surrounding Lucius, the son of Maximus, instead. Filming began in 2023 with Paul Mescal as the lead, yet with an on-set accident and the raging Screen Actors Guild strike, production didn't kick back up until the very end of 2023. However, with a fast-filming schedule behind Scott and his crew, Gladiator II was released in the fall of 2024, 24 years after the original film. The Twisters sequel never actually went into development in 2020 and wasn't officially announced until 2022. There wasn't any real reason for the delay other than taking the time to find the right story and director to take on the sequel. Helen Hunt, original star of the 1996 Twister , had even pitched her own idea for a sequel that she'd hope to direct following her character through more storm-chasing adventures, but was ultimately rejected by Universal. However, the film came to fruition and was released in July of 2024 with director Lee Isaac Chung, over 28 years after the original. Terminator 2: Judgement Day suffered many financial struggles, a lack of interest, ownership issues, and technological issues in developing as a sequel to The Terminator. There were various limitations on the technology and visual effects needed for the film, as well as multiple production, financial, and ownership delays that caused the seven-year gap between the two Terminator films. The delay behind the sequel to Psycho seemed to be nothing more than making time for the story development, establishing a promising tone following the original, and to follow the agreement between Universal Pictures and Oak Media to finance and develop four films, one of which was Psycho II. However, the idea of sequels wasn't immensely popular in this time of Hollywood, which is another reason why it took 23 years for the sequel to Psycho to even be brought to life. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre looked to be a promising franchise after the immense success of the first film installment of the same title. While it took nearly 12 years to create the second film and sequel, it was primarily due to the first film's great success, popularity, and reception. Director Tobe Hopper also wanted to explore other creative avenues with the Texas Chainsaw franchise, which added to the delay of the sequel film as well. After The Godfather Part II was released in 1974, director Francis Ford Coppola felt at peace with the finish of the Corleone story and felt he didn't need to make another film. Yet, after some of his next films failed financially, Coppola decided to re-enter the world of The Godfather upon an offer he couldn't refuse. Eventually, Coppola banded back together with past crew members to develop the story for the third Godfather film, which was finished and released nearly 16 years after the second installment in 1990. The Incredibles 2 was released nearly 14 years after the original and largely due to the fact that writer/director Brad Bird wasn't in it for the franchise money, but the story itself. He stated, ""The thing is, many sequels are cash grabs. There’s a saying in the business that I can’t stand, where they go, ‘if you don’t make another one, you’re leaving money on the table.’ It’s like, money on the table is not what makes me get up in the morning; making something that people are gonna enjoy a hundred years from now, that’s what gets me up. So if it were a cash grab, we would not have taken fourteen years – it makes no financial sense to wait this long – it’s purely [that] we had a story we wanted to tell."" There wasn't actually ever a plan for a sequel to the first Inside Out that was released back in 2015. However, the director of the original film and Chief Creative Officer of Pixar, Pete Docter, approached director Kelsey Mann to begin development on a sequel years later. Mann spoke on the success of Inside Out, claiming ""It wasn't intended to have this greater of an impact as it did. And I think over the years, that's just grown. That's probably where Pete [Docter] was like, 'You know what, there might be something else here that we could do'."" In 2018, director David Gordon Green made the decision to ""start over"" and essentially scrap the last nine installments of the Halloween franchise to make a ""new"" sequel to the original 1978 Halloween. Halloween (2018) is set 40 years after the massacre of the first film and picks up off the dynamics and story elements of the first film. Some fans loved the idea of starting fresh in the franchise as they believed it got out of hands at times, yet other fans weren't so pleased with the sudden, drastic changes. However, as being that Halloween (2018) is now considered the sequel to the 1978 classic, there's nearly 40 years between the two making of the films. Author Stephen King actually wrote the sequel to The Shining in 2013 titled Doctor Sleep, which hit shelves 36 years after the original. Shortly after publication, Warner Bros. began the development of the sequel, yet was faced with funding issues early on. However, upon the success of King's film adaptation It, funding was secured. Shortly after, Director Mike Flanagan hopped aboard and re-wrote the script, attempting to abide by the integrity of the book and the first film as well. This took significant time, and the film didn't start production until 2018. Yet, the sequel was eventually released in 2019, nearly 39 years after the making of the original film, The Shining. Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was released nearly 10 years following the original film and largely due to the fact that production didn't begin until late 2017, leading the film into a 2018 release. However, It's said the decade delay is due mostly to the considerable time spent developing the writing, casting, music, and the actual filming of the movie itself. There's not much that specifically suggests why it took almost 28 years to make the sequel to Tron other than the fact that Disney had other focuses and interests at the time. Disney had a tough time selling the appeal of Tron and found it underperforming in various ways, which made them shift from supporting the franchise altogether for quite some time. Yet, after 14 long years, Disney finally agreed to develop and release the sequel, Tron: Legacy. Tim Burton shed light on why he took 36 years to make the sequel to cult-classic film, Beetlejuice, stating, ""it just became a very personal movie, like a kind of weird family movie … that became the emotional hook. The three generations of mother, daughter, granddaughter, life, death —just basic, normal things that we all experience and then, especially if you’re lucky enough to get older, you feel those things. So that’s where it really started and it really could have only happened for me after all this time.” He shared how he felt he couldn't have made the sequel anytime sooner by adding, ""Only time can show you your own experience in life. I couldn’t have made [Beetlejuice Beetlejuice] back in 1989 … now I feel things after 30 years of going through a bunch of good and bad ups and downs … it’s like when I made Big Fish . I couldn’t have made that film before my father died. I [could] only make that having those feelings that surprised me. So it’s the same as this.""",2025-06-24T17:48:56.305206+00:00

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/colingorenstein/emmy-contenders-to-stream-on-hulu,entertainment,,"With Emmy Nominations Right Around The Corner, Here Are 12 Series I Think Will Be Award Season Favorites",18,1419,9,21,"These Hulu and FX series won our hearts and now they'll likely be in contention for a statuette, too. BuzzFeed Contributor Last year, FX dominated the Primetime Emmys and the Creative Arts Awards with 36 total awards — a whopping 119 total nominations when combined with Hulu. While FX might not have a Shōgun this go-around, a quick scan through some of the platform's hottest contenders indicate FX and Hulu could be sitting pretty again this year. Let's take a look at some of these titles to keep an eye on, shall we? Note : Abbott Elementary is on ABC, a Walt Disney Company property available on Hulu, and would not be included in the overall FX/Hulu tally. Thanks to the very strange category that is (say it with me) ""Limited or Anthology Series or TV Movie,"" we may very well see Michelle Williams go head to head against Renee Zellweger , who starred in Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy — which, by Emmys definition, is considered a ""TV Movie,"" despite also playing in theaters abroad. Dying For Sex , based on the real-life story of Molly Kochan — whose terminal cancer diagnosis prompted a journey of sexual exploration — was an undeniable critical hit and featured what many believe to be career-best work from Jenny Slate and Michelle Williams. Consider them locks. Best shot: Limited or Anthology Series, Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or TV Movie (Michelle Williams), Supporting Actor in a Limited or Anthology Series or TV Movie (Rob Delaney), Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or TV Movie (Jenny Slate, Sissy Spacek), Watch it on Hulu . One of the other deeply strange phenomena of Emmy voting is that sometimes the voting windows overlap with multiple seasons of an eligible show. Such was the case with The Bear last year; It is very possible that having Season 3 — a much less critically favored season — streaming concurrently may have negatively influenced Season 2's awards haul. This recency bias could come into play again this year with Season 4 headed to streaming on June 25 while final-round voting is still underway. Best shot: Comedy Series, Actor in a Comedy Series ( Jeremy Allen White ), Actress in a Comedy Series (Ayo Edebiri), Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (Liza Colon-Zayas), Guest Actor in a Comedy Series (Jon Bernthal), Guest Actress in a Comedy Series (Jamie Lee Curtis) Watch it on Hulu . It's rare for a show to pick up awards momentum in its fourth season, but that seems to be exactly what's happening with Only Murders . Call it the "" Emilia Pérez effect,"" but the show somehow managed a shocking win at the SAG Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Comedy Series. Now, with Meryl Streep in the mix (and a showmance that is bringing renewed outside interest to the show), I have to imagine the momentum will only grow from here.

Abbott Elementary is an unstoppable force in TV comedy. With three consecutive years of nominations, including wins for Writing, Supporting Actress (Sheryl Lee Ralph), and Lead Actress (Quinta Brunson), and a growing number of overall ensemble recognitions, the beloved workplace mockumentary series on ABC now faces an unusually crowded category of comedy competitors. New smash hits like The Studio and Nobody Wants This will certainly make this race interesting.

Cult-favorite What We Do In The Shadows has never been recognized at the Emmys. Now, having wrapped its sixth and final season, the voting body has one final shot to give the show its flowers. This wouldn't be without precedent, either; The Hollywood Reporter recently explored this phenomenon at great length , singling out shows like Slow Horses, The Gilded Age , Reservation Dogs, and The Morning Show , all of which received their first Emmy nominations after multiple blanked seasons. Best shot: Comedy Series, Actor in a Comedy Series (Matt Berry) Watch it on Hulu . And now, back to the most unhinged Emmys category, which I've already teased will likely include Zellweger and Williams. Anything can happen here! And that includes an Ellen Pompeo nomination for her first big role post- Grey's. While Pompeo has never been considered a major player in the Emmys conversation before, she probably deserves an award for her massive campaigning effort this year, alone, which, yes, included a Call Her Daddy interview. Best shot: Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or a TV Movie (Ellen Pompeo), Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or a TV Movie (Imogen Faith Reid) Watch it on Hulu . The only thing standing in the way of Say Nothing getting an Emmy nomination? Fans of the show...saying nothing. Despite receiving rave reviews, and what seemed to be promising interest and viewership at the time of release, chatter around the limited series adapted from the Patrick Radden Keefe book has seemingly died down in the months since. Could this be the result of its binge-drop rollout? Or the result of so many shows being dumped in the last month of Emmys eligibility? Who knows! But whatever happens, this is a series absolutely worth your time. Best shot: Best Limited or Anthology Series, Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or a TV Movie (Lola Petticrew), Best Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or a TV Movie (Maxine Peake) Watch it on Hulu . A posthumous nod for the great Linda Lavin seems like a logical place for the Television Academy to show support for this new series, which follows three gay men who retire to Palm Springs. Could the series, which has drawn inevitable comparisons to The Golden Girls , be a little too throwback-y for the voting body's taste? (See also: Poker Face , a Columbo-esque ""howdunnit,"" that missed out on a Comedy Series nom for its season and, again, seems to be on the bubble). Best shot: Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series (Linda Lavin) Watch it on Hulu . With 15 Oscar wins already under its belt, let's just say The Handmaid's Tale doesn't exactly need another statuette to rewrite its legacy like What We Do In the Shadows does . Even so, it's still possible that voters will want to show their love for the juggernaut by awarding the final season's undeniable performances from Elisabeth Moss and Cherry Jones, the ultimate Guest Actress scene-stealer. Best shot: Drama Series, Actress in a Drama Series (Elisabeth Moss), Guest Actress in a Drama Series (Cherry Jones) Watch it on Hulu . After a surprise (to me) Oscar nomination for American Fiction , I have come to the conclusion that we should never rule out Sterling K. Brown from any acting category he is eligible for. This is especially true in the case of his new apocalyptic thriller, Paradise, because, notably, it is a reunion with This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman — with whom he earned five Lead Actor in a Drama nominations and one win. Best shot: Actor in a Drama Series (Sterling K. Brown) Watch it on Hulu . How beautiful would that be to see Jeremy Allen White and Bruce both nominated in the same year? It seems likely, with Road Diary: Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band, a well-reviewed documentary about the legendary musician's ethos and mission, in the mix. Its biggest competitor will be the buddy road trip doc Will & Harper which — surprise! — is Emmy eligible. Perhaps it will have more success here than it did at the Oscars. Best shot: Documentary or Nonfiction Special Watch it on Hulu . Another strong entry from FX/Hulu in the docu space is the five-part series Social Studies from Lauren Greenfield — a fascinating and sobering examination of teenhood in the age of TikTok. It's hard to imagine voters forgetting some of the alarming discoveries that this documentary makes when it comes time to put pen to paper.

Highly recommend and so many colors to choose from!"" — Karyn's Kloset Price: $16.99 (available in sizes XS–XXL and 22 colors) Promising review: ""These are my favorite new pants. I want them in every color! They fit perfectly and the length is also perfect if you plan on wearing wedges. I don't mind them dragging the ground just a tad, so I also wear mine with sandals. They wash well in the washing machine for me and I always air dry them. The color stays true and they got maybe a TAD shorter, but that was a good thing in my opinion. Also, they have POCKETS!! The yoke-style elastic waist is super forgiving. Love these!"" — ASmith Price: $27.99 (available in sizes S–XXL and 23 colors) Promising review: ""I bought this dress to take on our trip to Charleston, SC, and it was perfect!

I’ve gotten these wet already and they’ve stayed in shape so far, no tarnishing. I usually always take my jewelry off when in shower, pool, beach, etc. I get overstimulated so I always take them off but there are times I don’t remove them. It’s been one year since I’ve had the dark blue one and two months for the multicolored one; they’ve held up well. Perfect for a little gift. Goes with my current daily bracelet stack. Fits my wrists comfortably. I hope they come out with an 8inch diameter that way I can also use them lower on my wrists."" — Larsa PL. Price: $12.99+ (available in seven colors) Promising review: ""THERE'S A PERFECT SLIT for peeing! At first I thought, awe man...its ripped! But it's not! Material is soft.

I wore it after this incident, and it still looks perfect!"" — Sadey Maly Price: $8.99+ (available in sizes S–3X and 30 colors) Promising review: ""I never ever buy jeans from Amazon because jeans are so hard to shop for. I’m honestly jumping for joy about how much I looooove these; they are sooo soft and stretchy and look so classy. I may have to buy another pair, they are that great.

Don't think just buy! I bought my normal size and they fit perfect! But if you have thicc thighs booty or hips or if you want them baggier I would size up . Most shorts are too long or too wide in the leg but these shorts are perfect for me! Could be worn around the house, workout or casual outing! They are thick and soft. The color is slightly darker than pictured but I really like it. Love love! Im going to buy more colors for sure!"" — Regina Price: $14.99+ (available in sizes XS–XXL and 29 colors) Promising review: ""LOVE this shirt! Super comfortable, and great quality!

Great buy and great quality!"" — E Vincent Price: $42.90 (available in 10 colors) Promising review: ""This dress is exactly what I was looking for. Something with a little bit of smoothing that doesn't require a bra. I have DDs and this held them up surprisingly well. I also like that the fabric on top is ribbed and stretchy and doesn't cling. I loved it so much I immediately bought it in black, as well."" — Katherine Price: $58.99 (available in sizes XS–4X and 12 colors) Promising review: ""Very comfy, breathable and soft.

Highly recommend these for anyone looking to add a chic accessory to their collection!"" — Arsalan Price: $11.99+ (available in two sizes, 10 colors, and various multipacks) Promising review: ""A must-have! This cover-up is perfect! The sleeve length is dreamy. Truly, I've been looking for a cover-up like this since my teens and nothing was ever just right. If you're on the fence, just do it! Material feels nice. It is a smidge heavy to me, but it will be perfect for the evenings around the pool or on the beach."" — Keirsten Price: $28.88 (available in sizes S–XXL and 30 colors) Promising review: ""This sweater goes with most everything. I’ve gotten so many compliments. Dress up or dress down. Even more beautiful in person."" — Lindsey P. Price: $35.98 (available in sizes XS–3X and 27 colors) Promising review: ""These are super cute and great quality. I like that it’s a stone-like effect on the top — I didn’t realize that from the pictures. I want more! I ordered a few other similar earrings at the same time that were cheaper. You could definitely tell the difference in the quality. The tassels on the cheaper ones were frayed and not as smooth as these. It was also nice that they sent several backs."" — Kindle Customer Price: $12.99 (available in 39 colors) Promising review: ""Such a great shirt! A little bit of a dressed up T-shirt makes this a favorite for me. The fabric is soft and it fits well. It’s not oversized so it looks like a more expensive shirt than a regular tee.

Probably going to get other colors very soon. Love an easy slip-on that’s affordable."" — Bran fish Price: $29.99 (available in women's sizes 6–11 and tons of colors) Promising review: ""I bought the black and white top for a trip to Hawaii, and I wish I bought more! For me, I hate wearing tank tops because my bra straps always show. This top was the perfect solution! It’s so comfortable, has great padding, and was great material for the Hawaii weather.

These shoes have one ~sole~ purpose, and it's to keep you comfy no matter what time zone you're in. BuzzFeed Staff Unless otherwise specified, all sizes in this post are listed in women’s. Promising reviews: ""These shoes are super comfortable and supportive. I used to play pickleball on hard court surfaces with tennis shoes with little padding. I developed sore feet which had a term — plantar fasciitis!! These New Balance tennis shoes with thick memory foam inserts saved the day! I can keep playing the game I love and my foot pain is nearly gone! Best tennis shoes ever! And they come in wide too, which makes the fit perfect!!!"" — Library ""I love these! They are the perfect dad sneakers and super in style! I love the blue color as well. They’re comfortable, great quality, and they provide a lot of support. They’re true to size as well."" — Stephanie Russell Get them from Amazon for $50.97+ (available in sizes 5–12, including narrow and wide sizes, and three styles). I spent three weeks traveling through eight different European cities and let me tell you — bringing these sandals with me was probably one of the best decisions I've ever made. My most worn pair of shoes during my trip, hands down. The reasons I was on the hunt for comfy sandals were 1. I didn't want my feet enclosed all day while trekking the whole city in warm weather and 2. Some outfits simply pair better with sandals. I hiked up to the Acropolis of Athens in these babies, and that stone floor was slippery . And still, out of my group of 11 family members and friends, I was the first one to make it to the top (and yes, I did brag). I even told two of my friends that went with me to get these for the trip, and they were eternally grateful for my rec. Promising review: "" As someone who owns several pairs of Birks, these sandals are absolutely up to the expectations of real Birks! The Birks I have are the Arizona soft footbed. I wanted this style of Birks but I couldn’t find the soft footbed version in them. I saw these and thought I might as well try them for the price. Let me tell you, these are even comfier than my soft-footbed Arizona Birks! Omg, they feel amazing. They are nice and padded! They are so adorable, too! Great quality."" — Lee Get it from Amazon for $34.98 (available in women's sizes 5–12, two widths, and 20 colors). I present to you: my holy grail travel sneakers. These bbs are so lightweight, you could probably set them on a balcony and a mere breeze would blow them away (okay, I'm not sure how accurate that actually is, but I swear I can't be far off). But don't let their cute 'n' casual look and light-as-a-feather weight fool you — these shoes mean BUSINESS. I've worn these on a three-hour tour of the Vatican, through the Colosseum, and finished the day off with a cobblestone-filled walk back to the hotel — and I felt like I was ~floating~ through it all. And that was just *one* day. They do scuff up a bit easily, but they're a breeze to clean. Nothing some handy-dandy shoe wipes can't handle! Trust me, the cloud-like comfort these shoes offer is 1,000% worth it. Promising review: ""This is the review you need, I promise. Let me start by saying that once booking a 5-week study abroad trip to Italy, my search began for the perfect tennis shoe. These were the top-recommended shoe everywhere, so I took the leap. I wore these shoes almost every single day in Italy, averaging about 20,000+ steps per day without even breaking these shoes in and let me tell you, THEY DID NOT DISAPPOINT. These shoes did not hurt my feet the ENTIRE trip, they were so comfortable and had amazing support.  How easily they dirty was so irrelevant to me after how amazing they held up otherwise and how comfortable they were for me. Because of this, I would 100000% recommend these shoes to anyone who is traveling and walking a lot and needs a cute yet comfy shoe, or even as an everyday shoe. They are not super hard to clean but not necessarily easy either so just keep that in mind but the shoes held up amazing and went with all my outfits. I am so thankful I got them for my trip!"" — Hannah Grella Get them from Amazon for $75 (available in sizes 5–13 and in 24 colors). Promising reviews: ""They felt weird the first time I put them on…but as I started walking in them it got better! Usually my feet are killing me by the end of the day or I’m just super sweaty in my dress shoes, but these are like walking on a literal CLOUD ☁️ and they let my feet breathe! "" — Alyssa ""Literally the BEST shoes ever! So comfy. I spent a whole day at Disney with no complaints , normally I'm tired after two hours of walking in the park, but with these babies, I was up and walking alll day with no problem."" — Katherine Get them from Amazon for $54.99+ (available in sizes 5–11 and four colors). FYI, aside from their style and comfort, Tevas are *known* for their durability — one reviewer said their first pair lasted for over 20 YEARS. This isn't your average sandal that falls apart after one season. Promising reviews: ""These sandals are SO comfortable. I got them to wear on a trip to Hawaii, and they were the best thing I brought. Easy to walk in the sand, so commutable to walk on any terrain. You can wash them off if they get dirty. So cushy and soft. Velcro for easy walking and adjustments. Such a good sandal for a walking or beach trip. I can't wait to wear them this summer. They are so cute too!! The mid-height is the perfect height and can be dressed up or down. So cute with activewear or with a summer dress. Love!!"" — natasha ""My niece recommended Teva so I decided to give it a try, especially for an upcoming trip to the mountains. Yesterday, I was caught in a rainstorm and stepped into a stream of rainwater that was over my feet. My Tevas performed beautifully. They dried quickly, didn't slip in the water, and they also stayed perfectly on my feet. I like the adjustability of the straps in several places where you can fit it to your foot. I actually bought two pairs (different colors) of Tevas at the same time, and I am enjoying both of them! I highly recommend!"" — J L Phillips Get them from Amazon for $59.95+ (available in sizes 5–14 and so many colors/patterns/styles). Promising review: ""I love these shoes as everyday sandals! I can throw them on with anything and feel put together and comfortable. I did not have to break them in and have already worn them several times since purchasing a couple of weeks ago. I would very much recommend them."" — Cait Get them from Nisolo for $79 (originally $138; available in sizes 5–11 and in four colors). FYI: These are made from recycled bottles! Promising review: ""I bought these shoes to wear on vacation to the Grand Canyon. I did a lot of walking on that trip, and my feet never hurt and I still looked cute. Then a few months later, we went to Durango, Colorado and did a ton of walking and again, my feet never hurt. I washed them and let them air dry several times over the next year and they came out great every time. They soon became my daily shoes to wear around the house. I have already bought a second pair to replace them so I can still look cute and be comfortable and wear the first pair when I water the garden. I would definitely recommend these shoes!"" — J. Perkins Get them from Amazon for $55 (available in sizes 5–13, including wide sizes, and in 28 styles — not all styles available in all sizes). Macarena Collection is a small biz based in Buena Park, California! Since they only make whole sizes, they suggest sizing down if you're in between sizes as the shoes will stretch and mold to your feet as you wear them. Promising review: "" Can I give these 1,000 stars? They are soooooo comfortable!!! I was afraid because my feet are on the wider side, but oh my do they fit absolutely amazingly well!! Don’t hesitate to buy them!! I love them! I love them! I Love them!!"" — Jennifer Baez Get them from Macarena Collection on Etsy for $48.74 (originally $64.99; available in sizes 5–10). Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping contributor Brittany Ross says about them: ""I bought these boots last year and they quickly became the ones I reach for whenever I'm not wearing sneakers. They're SO comfortable (I've worn them walking around both NYC and Europe for hours on end) , and that bit of extra height makes 5' tall me feel like I can take on the world. They're also ridiculously cute and worth every cent of what they cost, thanks to their durability and versatility. I've worn them in the rain and never once worried about slipping! Best of all, they look great with a casual jeans look or gussied up with a slip skirt, which I've paired them with on many occasions. I know they'll last me a long time, but I'm already certain I won't hesitate to buy a replacement pair when they finally give out. 10/10, buy them! Oh, and FYI, they run a little big, so consider sizing down!"" Promising review: ""I have been wearing Docs for years now, and this pair has to take first place for comfort . They're incredibly cute and versatile, can be dressed up or down, and just like any other pair are faithfully durable. Docs always run big so I sized a full size down and still comfortably wear them with thin-thick socks. I brought them on a long trip, wore them in various weather conditions like rain/snow/forest trails, and they worked great. "" — Stacy Cruz Get them from Amazon for $95.69+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in two colors). Promising review: ""I live in the desert and noticed our upcoming trip to London had rain in the forecast nearly every day. I didn’t want to walk around in wet tennis shoes, and we were planning a trip with heavy walking. I have problems with plantar fasciitis, so I was skeptical , I usually buy expensive, supportive shoes. But I took a chance. These boots did not disappoint. I ended up wearing them every day in London. They were very comfortable, my feet stayed dry, they were super cute and the best part, ZERO foot pain. We walked a lot, 7–8 miles a day . I will put these in my closet for other rainy-day trips!"" — volvomom Get them from Amazon for $32.99 (available in sizes 5–11 and 16 colors). Promising review: ""My new everyday sneaker. I love the design and I love the small platform to give me height! They are so comfortable too, I’ve worn them to the zoo walking for hours and my feet didn't hurt . I love these shoes and am so glad I finally bought them!"" — Meredith Johnstone Get them from Amazon for $55.99 (available in sizes 5–11.5 and 33 styles — not all colors/styles available in all sizes). Promising review: ""I traveled to Belize for a girls trip. All six of us ordered this shoe. They are very supportive, comfortable, and protect your feet/toes. The shoes are lightweight, easy to pack, and also dried quickly. I also was never worried they were going to fall off because of the elastic adjustable strap. They were true to size for all of us. We used the shoes ATM Cave and Rio Frio Water Falls. It happens to rain a lot so we also wore them to ATV because the puddles were ankle deep on the ATV. I also wore them when in the ocean because the floor was rocky in some parts. I highly recommend purchasing these shoes."" — Shawna Weiss Get them from Amazon for $29.99 (available in sizes 6–11 and in 31 colors). Sizing up a half size if you have wide feet is recommended. Promising review: ""I have purchased three different pairs of these shoes because of the color variety and the comfort! I’ve had my black and gray pair for 3+ years and I still wear them. When traveling overseas, I wanted something neutral to blend with everything I wore. First time wearing them was walking around Portugal walked 13,000 steps that day and they were perfect! I never had any rubbing or cuts on my feet from where they touch my ankles. As a slip on shoe, I never felt unsecured walking up inclines, cobblestones or stairs while traveling. This is my go to for a slip on shoe because of the color options & comfortability"" — Bethany Get them from Amazon for $38.48+ (available in sizes 5–13, wide, and in 33 colors). Promising review: ""I’ve worn these everywhere!! They are super comfy and lightweight, go with everything, and run true to size . I got them in white as well, and I’m obsessed. I’ve been to a concert in them, driven in them, and also, I went on vacation recently and walked all over the city, went out, and danced at bars. I’ve never had a pair of heels that are so comfy! Seriously so worth the money."" — Courtney Wilson Get them from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in sizes 5–12 and in 26 colors — not all colors/styles available in all sizes). Ma'am Shoes is a woman-owned small biz that makes shoes with a focus on comfort, style, and sustainability. BuzzFeed Shopping freelancer Danielle Healy LOVES these shoes: ""Sometimes it feels like my feet are made of paper with how easily they blister. So when a brand markets itself as having a focus on stylish comfort, I am all ears. Fresh out of the box, I wore these red beauties out to dinner (a 20-minute walk each way) and my feet were no worse for wear. So I decided to put them through the ultimate test — a wedding. Even after hours of dancing, my feet felt great and I got loads of compliments. A statement shoe that really does look and feel great? *Big swoon.*"" Get them from Ma’am Shoes for $150+ (originally $300+; available in sizes 4.5–11 and five colors). Promising review: ""These are a perfect fit and feel like I am slipping my feet into butter. They are airy and cool. I tested them out and vacuumed and mopped the house in them. No sweaty feet, no slipping on the wet floor. They can go with anything, Dress them up, formal wear, throw 'em on with cut off shorts and a tank top, a sundress, jeans and tee, any thing, even PJs. T hey are shoes to travel in, fly in, go to Disneyland in. They cover my whole foot and I don't have to worry about missing the pedicure lady. They don't pinch, they are well made, no threads or seams pinch or are stiff or give me pressure spots to cause blisters or soreness after hours of wear — it's like going barefoot. Get a little dirt on them, and they just wipe right off. I will definitely be buying another pair from this company. For the price, they are worth it."" — hotmdc Get them from Amazon for $23.46 (available in sizes 5–12 and in nine colors). Promising review: ""This is now my go-to travel shoes. I first wore them on my vacation to Curacao and it was the perfect shoes for walking tour of Willemstad. I didn't get the chance to break them in before traveling but turns out I didn't need to. They are comfortable and doesn't rub the back of my foot which usually happens with shoes of this style. I wear them everywhere at this point and I will reorder for my next vacation as I have worn out the first pair."" — Janjan Get it from Amazon for $36.97+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in 19 colors). Promising review: ""I bought these to take on a trip; they arrived and I packed them without breaking them in — no worries, they are so comfortable, I wore them the whole trip . Love, love these shoes! This is my second pair, first have lasted a year and I wear the old ones still. They wash up nicely, too! Highly recommend!!!"" — Lori M. Get them from Amazon for $27.87+ (available in sizes 5.5–12, including select wide sizes, and 13 designs). Promising review: ""These shoes are perfect! I was looking for a summer sandal that I could walk in/dance in while also being comfortable. I have flat feet and weak ankles so it was a gamble, but these are so cute and comfy . I will definitely check out their other shoes. I see that other people pointed this out, and it's important to note, the [hook and loop strap] is pretty loose so you may need to readjust a few times, but it's not inconvenient enough to return."" — Flatfooted Get them from Sorel for $135 (available in sizes 5–12 and in four colors). Promising review: ""Reaching for these sandals more and more because they’re comfy, cute, and elevate my outfits! They didn’t require any breaking in and I’ve worn them for an entire day out and had no issues with long-term wear . Fit was true to size. Going to get another color since I love them so much!"" — Nidhi Patel Get them from Amazon for $26.99 (available in sizes 6–10, in two heel heights, and 24 colors). Promising review: ""I have had the brown color of these sandals for going on three years now. They are the most comfortable sandal ever. I've worn them all over on several vacations, all over Vegas. No blisters!! So cute and casual. Ordered white and will probably order the black! They are my favorite ever!!!"" — Amazon Customer Get them from Amazon for $34.99 (available in sizes 5.5–12, including wide sizes, and 30 color/style combinations). The brand mentions they can run large, so consider sizing down, especially if you're between sizes. Promising review: ""I am obsesseddd with these shoes! They don't even feel like I'm wearing platforms. They just feel like sandals, which is good because I'm clumsy. I ordered the size 7 because I'm usually a 6.5, but they don't have half sizes. The 7 is fine, I'd say just about a half size too big (lol), but I just tightened the back strap, and we're good to go!!! They're great. I have like 100 pairs of shoes, but I wear these several times a week, whenever I can. Worth every penny. I want 10 more pairs of Dr. Marten's sandals now."" — Maggie Get them from Amazon for $82.76+ (available in whole sizes 5–11 and in five colors). Promising reviews: ""These shoes are my favorite! I love how comfy they are and they go with everything. Great for traveling, working out, or hiking. "" — Emma Smith ""SOOOOO COMFORTABLE. I bought these because I saw a video posted on TikTok. Never did I imagine that they would be this comfortable . I have received so many compliments on these sneakers, and I'm actually looking to purchase another pair in lime green."" — awesome game Get them from Amazon for $37.71+ (available in sizes 5.5–10.5 and 22 colors). Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping freelancer Rachelle Yang says about them: ""I had these bbs for three years but had to say goodbye to them because it was finally their time to go. 🥲 I first got these shoes because I have very weak ankles and needed shoes that would support them, but these did waaaay more than that . The platforms were a lot comfier than I thought they were going to be, and I wore these EVERYWHERE. From concerts to hikes to beaches, these bad boys really put in the work and held up through everything. I never had a moment when I felt uncomfy with these on, and besides all that, they're SO SO SO cute!!!"" Promising review: ""I've owned many pairs of Converse in my life, and these are the most comfortable I've ever worn. With the platform there's more cushion in the bottom, making them so comfy . They're absolutely adorable and who doesn't want to be just a couple of inches taller! :) Now I just need them in black!"" — Jennifer Kaul Get them from Amazon for $60+ (available in sizes 5–13 and in various styles/colors). Promising review: ""I have never been compelled to write a review, but these shoes are soooo beautiful!!! I got the pink and gold and they are comfy and pretty. I cannot keep count of the total strangers on the street stopping me and saying how much they love my shoes and asking me where I got them!!! This price is amazing, and I truly can say I got bang for my buck! True to size, I'm an 8 and ordered the 8 and they fit perfectly."" — Dora M. Get them from Amazon for $21.99+ (available in sizes 6–11 and in eight colors). Promising reviews: ""I absolutely LOVE these shoes! They are super comfy and adorable! I have a wide foot so I went up a half-size. They fit great! Despite the pointy look, my toes are not squished. The material of the shoe is a soft, suede-like fabric, so it stretches. No need to break-in the shoes. "" — CSG ""Really love these loafers! They look way more expensive than they are, and are great travel shoes — comfortable in airports and on flights! Would absolutely repurchase!"" — Matthew (Julie) LaRoche Get them from Amazon for $22.80 (available in sizes 5–15, including wide sizes, and 11 styles). Promising reviews: ""These shoes were the most comfortable platform sandals I’ve ever worn, straight out of the box. I was leaving a cold climate to vacation in a warm one, so hadn’t broken in these shoes at all and immediately was walking long distances over uneven streets with no problem . Feet never hurt. Sandals are sassy and look as good or better than advertised. Easy to dress up your outfit and remain comfortable."" — frequentcustomer ""THESE ARE AMAZING SHOES!!!! Perfect for a night out or vacation! I wore them in Mexico every night and they were so comfy and cute . I cannot wait to wear them for summer!"" — Ally Commito Get them from Amazon for $37.99+ (available in sizes 5.5–11 and in seven colors).

Promising review : ""These far exceeded my expectations. They are the perfect cups! The design is lovely and the feel of the cup is great. Really a beautiful mug addition."" — Mdr Price: $14.59+ (available in six styles and multipacks) Promising review: ""I pretty much love everything about this romper. I ordered the dark green, but I want it in every color! It is super comfortable. Even right out of the package, it wasn't very wrinkled. The material wasn't too thick or thin. I wore it in summer with sandals, but I think you could easily add a sweater/tights/boots for a cute fall look. It was easy to get on/off in the bathroom (one small button at the back of the neck)... And, best of all, it has pockets!!!"" — Jessica K. Price: $23.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and 18 colors) Promising review : ""I normally don’t love lip products. I have small lips and I am never really satisfied! But this stuff is sooooo good! You don’t even understand how moisturizing and glossy this is. It’s not sticky, very pigmented, and the stain it leaves behind is gorgeous! I got the Rosie one, and it's chef's kiss perfect! I’m totally getting more!"" — Katherine Stanton Price: $11.80+ (available in 12 shades) Promising review: ""The hype off TikTok is real about this scent. It’s very warm and vanilla-smelling. Almost like a beachy vibe. I hate how no one would give me any kind of explanation on how it smelled, but glad I jumped on the bandwagon with this one."" — Karli Bullins Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in nine other scents). It even comes with eight extra brush heads AND a travel case! Promising review: ""I'm now at over three years with this toothbrush and it still looks and works like new. I use it in the shower, rinse it under water after every use, and use it two to three times a day. The only thing that is maybe suffering at this point is the battery (lasts about 1.5 weeks now), but I also only charge it when the red charging light comes on. If you leave it on the charger stand daily, this may never be an issue for you. This is truly a great product for the price, and I would recommend it to anyone. I had originally felt that if it lasted as long as my Sonicare, it would save me some money, but at this point, it has surpassed my Sonicare by 2+ years for a fraction of the price! "" — Jesse Price: $39.95 Promising review: ""This product is witchcraft. My nails have always been brittle, flaky, and super prone to just breaking. Because of all that, I had the nasty habit of biting them. I didn’t take before or after but the image with no polish is just three days of use. My nails have been growing like [wild] since then and are stronger than ever in my life. The image with polish is about a month of use (once a day). Also, it helped me to stop biting my nails. I can now do my own nails and shape them the way I want. Never in my life did I think I’d have nails I could shape myself. I don’t leave a lot of reviews, but trust me when I say this product is worth the hype. I’m definitely a returning customer."" — Andrea Price: $9.99+ (available in three sizes and packs of two). This travel tumbler is insulated — so your hot or cold drinks will actually stay that way for hours! Promising review : ""I bought the 12-ounce, and let me tell you! This is by far the best travel mug I’ve EVER bought. Super leakproof (and I shove it into my tote bag and duffel bag). Super durable. Great material, and the sip? Super smooth. No slurping because it allows air to flow out and in while drinking . Such a great mug. Worth every damn penny. Highly recommend. P.S. — hot stuff stays super hot for a long time."" — Lindsay Panataleon Price: $24.98+ (available in two sizes and seven colors) Promising review: "" I purchased these originally in May 2020, and I finally bought a second pair in April 2022. I chose these two years ago to help with the foot/knee/back pain I was having while walking on the hard concrete floors of my lab. They soon became my all-day, everyday shoes: at work, at home, and outside. The fabric upper is slightly stretchy, making it feel like the shoe is hugging your foot without binding. I have a large bunio,n and these are the only shoes I’ve worn that don’t put pressure on it or have a seam in that area that causes pain. These sneakers have been through hundreds of hours of walking, along with yard work and hiking. I have machine-washed them countless times (not recently, lol), and they’ve held up without fraying or shrinking. The fabric comes completely clean from the red clay we have here in the south, along with stains from oil and chicken poop (don’t ask)."" — Lauren C Price: $35.60+ (available in sizes women's 5–13, in two widths, and 10 colors). Note: This set of pens writes in black ink. Promising reviews: ""As a nurse, I find that these are the best pens I’ve used! They are exactly as described!"" — Brandi L ""I love the matte texture of these pens. The fine tip also makes it easier to write smaller, since a lot of gel pens write very thickly. Also, the little ball bearing in the clip is very entertaining to roll with your thumb. These would be great for people who want to have a fidget on hand without making it obvious."" — Melody Price: $7.99+ (available in five styles and various pack sizes). The shade Cheers to No Smears is featured above on the left, and the shade Fast Foodie is featured on the right. Promising review : ""I just love this nail polish! Love the color and how fast it dries. I will order again."" — Georgie Price: $9.99 (available in 31 shades) Promising review: ""I have a pair of the Aerie crossover flare leggings, and those are worn out, so I decided to purchase another pair because I can’t live without my flares! Y'all, these leggings are the truth!! I have never seen such a great [alternative] for the Aerie ones. They feel like butter soft on your skin and have the same durability and thickness, even the same stitching!! Save your money and get these!!!"" — Jasmine Price : $12.49+ (available in women's sizes XS–XXL, four inseams, two inseam styles, and in 32 colors) Promising reviews: ""I have thinning hair due to a number of medical issues (thyroid, chemo), with the majority of bald/thin spots at the crown. The color match was perfect, and it's very easy to apply to the bare spots. It sprinkles on easily and covers wonderfully. I pat it into place and finish with hairspray, and I'm good to go. "" — mozart8 ""I have AA 4c hair that I recently cut super short. When it was long, my thin spots around the hairline were concealed. So, with my hair short, they were apparent and made me self-conscious. I purchased Boldify with just a little skepticism. I am so glad I purchased it. The application is easy and does not stain clothing. Be careful not to scratch your head throughout the day because you will see the dark coloring under your fingernails. It is a large bottle for the price. I will continue to buy and recommend."" — Jza Jza Price: $14.80+ (available in four sizes and a two-pack, and in 19 colors) Reviewer on the left is wearing the shade Pink Ice , reviewer on the right is wearing the shade Mink Brown . Promising review: ""I bought a couple of these lipsticks some time ago, and I was expecting nothing from them, and they delivered a lot. These lipsticks are very pigmented and creamy. One application will last several hours. They are moisturizing, and they look great on your lips."" — Yise Price: $1.29 (available in 23 shades) This set also comes with plastic gloves, a plastic cover, and rubber bands. Promising review: "" Bought these as an activity for teenagers. Dye color is vibrant and beautiful. We first made the designs using the provided directions and rubber bands, then dry dyed the shirts. We left the shirts in bags for 24 hrs and then washed them outside with a hose to not get the ink/dye all over. We then let the shirts dry outside in the sun, then we rinsed and dried them in the washer, then washed and dried them again. Color has stayed beautifully, and kids love the shirts!"" — Ariss M Price: $14.99 Promising review: "" As someone who owns multiple pairs of Birks, these sandals are absolutely up to the expectations of real Birks! The Birks I have are the Arizona soft footbed. I wanted this style of Birks, but I couldn’t find the soft footbed version in them. I saw these and thought I might as well try them for the price. Let me tell you, these are even comfier than my soft-footbed Arizona Birks! Omg, they feel amazing. They are nice and padded! They are so adorable, too! Great quality."" — Lee Price: $29.98+ (available in women's sizes 5–12, two widths, and 21 colors) Promising review: "" I recently tried this bra, and it has quickly become one of my favorites! The fit is perfect — true to size with just the right amount of stretch to ensure comfort all day. The straps are adjustable and don’t dig in, even after wearing them for hours. The fabric is soft against the skin, and the breathability is great, so I never feel overheated. The support is amazing without feeling too constrictive. It gives a natural lift and keeps everything in place without any uncomfortable digging or shifting. I also love the design; it's sleek and subtle, making it perfect to wear under a variety of outfits."" — Tzippy M Price: $16.94+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 14 colors) Promising review: ""After trying a bunch of different sports bras and tops, I came across this one . I absolutely love it. It’s super supportive and comfortable. The adjustable straps help make this the perfect fit."" — Perrone Price : $28 (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and nine colors) Promising review: "" This product is amazing. I used it for my chicken and dumplings recipe. I figured it was another one of those 'too good to be true' items, but this does everything it says it does. I literally shredded two large chicken breasts in seconds, yes SECONDS!! I wish I had taken a video, but I didn’t. It didn’t move/slip from the counter, and it was perfection! Wow, just Wow!"" — Ruthie K Voss Price: $9.99+ (available in nine colors) You can also spray it on all over if you need some quick head-to-toe moisture when you're in a hurry. Promising review: ""I wish I could rate this 100 stars. This stuff is INCREDIBLE... My skin instantly looks and feels hydrated, fresh, glowing, and comfortable. I am already on my third bottle of this; it is wonderful to incorporate into skincare as a first step, in between other products, as a setting/finishing spray for makeup, or throughout the day when your skin needs a little refresher. I wish they'd make a jumbo size of this (like, 10+ oz), because I would douse my entire body in this formula if I could."" — bex–7 Price: $20+ (available in two sizes and a two-pack) Promising review: ""Absolutely have become my favorite pair of sunglasses, and I have many pairs. Very trendy and quite affordable. I am shocked at how durable they are for the price point. My sunglasses take a beating on my head, thrown in my bag, and I usually break them in no time, but these have stood up to my normal wear. They offer solid sun protection but not super dark, which I love. They fit the face very well, not oversized and huge, but just right for me. Love them!"" — NittanyLion Price: $15.99 (available in nine colors) Promising review: "" Product works just as described! Our kiddos are 3 and 1, and both love to use it. We love that the pen can be attached and that we can lock the screen if we want to. Perfect for at home, car travel, and when we need the kids quiet and entertained."" — Sean C Price: $13.99+ (available in three sizes and five colors) Promising review: "" This is amazing! I wish I knew about this sooner! Makes opening any jar of any size so easy! Especially the ones with the airtight seal. Also, this is for anyone of any age or any strength… everyone can benefit. If you want to just make opening any jar effortless, you need this!"" — Kim Price: $6.99+ (available in two colors) Note: You do not have to have a subscription to see a live feed of the camera, but a subscription for $29.99/year is required to save the video. Promising review: "" Super easy to install. Works great in my little apartment next to my college. Comes with mounting accessories and a changing cable. The app and quality are great, and it even comes with an indoor doorbell chime. There is an optional subscription to save events for as low as $30/year, which is super cheap. That is about $0.08/day. For being as cheap as the doorbell camera is, it has really good picture quality and is extremely easy to use. Highly recommend rather than spending a ton of money on another expensive name brand camera."" — Lane White Price: $27.99+ (available in four colors) Promising review: ""I'm purchasing my third and fourth sets of these sheets today. One will be a gift for my mom and dad. Over a year later, I've had no issues at all. They continue to wash and fit perfectly and are easily adaptable for weather changes. I add a flannel top sheet or blanket when chilly. Can't be beat for under $20 a set."" — nativepeach Price: $10.79+ (available in five sizes and 30 colors and patterns) Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic . Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic , you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Check out a TikTok of the eye drops in action. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" — Angela Leonard Price: $11.93 If you're looking for a water-based cleanser to go with this one, reviewers love this pore-deep cleansing foam from the same brand for their double-cleansing routine! Promising review: ""My skin is *super* sensitive, but as I've aged (44 years), I feel like my pores have become more visible. I hadn't used an oil cleanser before and wasn't 100% sure how it should all work. The Anua oil cleanser works how we all once hoped Biore pore strips would work back in the day but without any pain or irritation. My skin is combination skin, so I have to be really careful about not drying out the dry spots (and getting eczema) and not over-hydrating the oily spots (and getting a breakout). I rub the oil on my face as the first part of my cleansing routine; I massage it in for ~60 seconds and then put a small amount of water on my fingers and begin rubbing that on my face. The water starts the emulsification process and helps to clean out everything the oil has bonded to/mixed with. Then, I just rinse it clean and use a gentle cleanser afterward. I haven't had any irritation, redness, or fallout from adding this product to my skincare routine. I love it. I am almost through my first bottle and if I go a few days without using the cleanser, my pores become more visible/dirty again. I will definitely keep purchasing the Anua oil cleanser."" — Tassa Price: $17.69 Promising review: ""This digital meat thermometer is the best I've ever had. I own others, but they are either too bulky to fit in the drawer or too hard to read. This one is small and lightweight; it's easy to pull out the probe and very easy to read the temperature. I purchased several as stocking stuffers for Christmas. They make a gift that will be appreciated for its size and ease of use, but most importantly, it will be a gift that gets used instead of put away in the closet."" — Kat29 Price: $12.99+ (available in two colors) Promising review: ""I have a golden retriever, and the shedding is out of control. My fabric sofa is constantly covered in hair and I finally decided to try this after reading an article about popular TikTok products. The reviews do not lie; this thing works magic!! I wish I had taken a before and after picture because the difference is noticeable. I watched the video tutorial before I tried it to ensure I was using it properly, and everything he says is true; you do really have to put your arm to work with vigorous back-and-forth movement! However, I find it's a great arm workout, and it works wonders."" — Joanne Ertel Price: $24.99+ (available in four colors) Remember to mix this concentrate with water before using! Promising review: ""My 15-year-old leather sectional hadn't been cleaned or conditioned in three to four years because I couldn't find anything that worked well without causing it to look blotchy. The color was also fading, and I thought it was a goner. After some elbow grease, the sectional looks great! It's now back to its original color without being blotchy. More importantly, the suppleness has returned. I can actually say that it looks as good as the day we bought it."" — jellybean55 Price: $16.99+ (available in three sizes) Promising review: ""Saw this on TikTok and have no regrets! Sturdy and super easy to apply. Great bang for the buck!"" — E. Bucci Price: Amazon for $9.99 (available in four colors and various packs) Promising review: "" I've used this one and a Le Creuset brand and see no difference in performance, maintenance, and cleaning. I've used it for beef stews and bread. Cleaned easily and seems very durable."" — Stephen Price: $32.01+ (available in three sizes and 10 colors) Check out our full review of the TubShroom here ! Promising review : ""I've had several different types of drain catchers over the years, and this one is the best one yet. I'm amazed at how much stuff is stopped from going down the bathtub drain. I wonder how my husband has any hair left on his head!! They pop in and outof  the drain easily, and are easy to clean if done shortly after a shower when it's wet. I use a Kleenex to grab everything and keep it contained. This catcher has passed the test, and I've purchased two more for our other bathrooms."" — BLP Price: $11.99+ (available in six colors) Promising review: "" When I first saw the advertisement for this product, I thought it was too good to be true, so I purchased it to see if it truly worked, and it absolutely did... I have 4c hair and everything I have ever used never worked — my hair would get frizzy or even go back to curly as soon as I stepped outside. I had no frizz, no static, and my hair was SO SOFT and it lasted a week and a half. I LOVE this product."" — Chy Marie Price: $12+ (available in two sizes and two kits) It's also available in an extra strength version and a version for curly hair . Promising review : ""This was a quarantine impulse buy for me: I suddenly want everything in my home perfectly organized. This was great. The top row fits my set of steak knives, and the bottom row holds miscellaneous knives for chopping."" — MKB from CT Price: $5.99 (also available in other sizes and styles) Promising review: ""So I initially started using another kojic acid soap to help with my hyperpigmentation due to shaving my face because I have PCOS and have developed hirsutism. I’m usually a 'full face of makeup at all times' kind of girl because of my insecurities, but this soap has given me a new confidence. I used it for the first time Saturday night and instantly saw the results of this soap. My skin looks so much more even. "" — Adrienne Jerkins Price: $14.99 for a two-pack (available in various pack sizes and bundles). Promising review: ""I bought this on a whim, and I’m hooked. I love the timer and dimmer features. So far, the lamp works great. It doesn’t put out a lot of heat, and I love that you can adjust the light. This is now going to be my go-to gift. "" — Amazon Customer Price: $26.59+ (available in 11 styles). Promising review: ""I’ve tried so many nipple covers over the years, and these are just in a league of their own! They stick and don’t move (sweat, clothes, moisturizer, etc. — nothing budges them), but then they peel off so easily. It’s magic. They are completely seamless, and my husband (without prompting) said they looked like a second skin. I’ve got quite 'triangular' boobs, and they completely mold to the shape and look like I just have no nipples lol. Only when I’m suuuuuper cold does any level of nipple start to show through, and even then, it’s minimal. They’re more pricey than others I’ve bought before but so worth it. The others were one and done — these have held up through several wears and are still in perfect condition. Will repurchase them as soon as they wear out, without a doubt! No more bras! "" — Alison BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Price: $26.50+ (available in five shades and three sizes). Promising review: ""I've used this specific brand for years now and have found them to be the best at reducing the size and redness of breakouts! Whenever I notice a zit popping up, I put one of these on right before bed, and it stays put all night, even when I toss and turn a lot. By morning, it's much less noticeable and practically nonexistent when I cover the zit with makeup . It's such a great practically zero-effort way to treat blemishes!"" — Ciera Velarde And check out BuzzFeed Shopping editor Amanda Davis 's full Mighty Patch review for more info! Price: $12.99 . Check out the Lash Princess mascara on TikTok ! Promising review : ""I got this because my niece recommended it, and it’s my new favorite! I am a bit of a mascara snob — it is the one type of makeup I use every day, and I have tried A LOT of different brands. This glides on nicely with little to no clumping, and my lashes look long and defined. Plus, the price is amazing, better than more expensive brands I have tried . Definitely worth the $!"" — Meg BuzzFeed editor Kayla Boyd wrote an in-depth Essence Lash Princess mascara review — check it out! Price: $4.99 . Promising review: ""These hangers do all the work for me. I was finally inspired to rid myself of flimsy, tacky dry cleaner hangers and bulky plastic ones — I’d have to size up my clothes in order to determine which ones wouldn’t slide off the plastic. With these hangers, everything works, and the velvet is like an easy-to-use magnet for my clothes. Nothing slips. The space-saving design makes a surprising difference. I share a small master closet, and thanks to these hangers, my side is roomy and organized now. "" — E.

They have AC but it does not work great and he has to be out in the heat for gym. He absolutely loves it! All his classmates have asked to use it. We charge it every other day overnight. It lasts 2 eight hour school days. My son has dropped it and I had to fix it a couple times but it was super simple to fix by popping things back in place. He has used it for several months on a daily basis and still going strong. It’s quiet enough to have on high in a classroom.” — Amazon customer “I have rosacea and I get hot and flushed super easy. This little fan is a life saver. Battery lasts a long time, has 3 speeds and even a little kick stand to prop it up on a table. Definitely recommend, helps me stay cool on hot days or when I start to flush.” — Steve, Carrie & Vince “Great little fan. It does exactly what it is supposed to do. I use it while doing my make-up. I do my eye lashes using it too. Very handy. It has different speeds which are each different from the other.

When you’re dressed in wedding clothes and dripping sweat on the beach all you want is a little breeze. This little fan got passed around all day. It also helped on the flight home, we boarded a plane that had no AC for 30 minutes and it was so hot in Dallas. Grab one for your trip! It is 100% worth it.” — Alyssa Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:49:02.951510+00:00

HuffPost Senior Staff Writer Promising reviews : “With a belt knife and this in your pocket, you can survive in the wilderness till found. I go to northern Canada regularly and always carry this for fire starting, knife sharpening and survival whistle. Easy to carry, never leave home without it. If it had a small high quality compass it would be perfect, but there is always the sun.” — Bassman “Great little sharpener. In an outdoor situation, you don’t want to spend a lot of time keeping your knife sharp. This little thing will keep your blade honed with very little effort. It’s light, has a lanyard hole, and the diamond sharpener has several different uses. I attach it to my knife scabbard so I can quickly (10 strokes or less) keep my edge nice and sharp while I’m using it.” — Michael Mitchell “Perfect for outdoor lovers! I bought one for my brother since he enjoys camping. He was playing around with it Christmas morning. The flint area is covered with this black material for safety.

I’ll be repurchasing forever."" —A reviewer, raving about their daily toner pad results. BuzzFeed Staff It's suitable for all hair types! Reviewers with everything from straight, fine hair to thick, curly hair said it worked for them. Promising review: ""I looooove this so much . The smell is amazing, and it tends to stick around for a while so I love getting whiffs of it through the day. My hair is softer and doesn’t seem as frizzy as before . I put it on after washing my hair, and then after it’s dry. I tend to wash my hair two times a week, so I’ll use it in between washes on my ends to make sure they still look nice and healthy. Great value too; I’ve been using it pretty consistently since purchasing and I’ve barely made a dent in it. Love it!"" — Noley Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in two sizes, as a mist, and four other formulas). Promising review: ""I kept seeing this product on social media and finally decided to give it a try. I use this twice daily, and it’s been a couple of weeks, and I definitely noticed my pores have shrunk . I even apply it to my neck and chest area. Product is soothing, gentle on my skin (I have extremely sensitive skin), no strong smell, cottons are soft, and did not cause any breakouts! It’s great for the value, and I’ll definitely be repurchasing these."" — Ee El Get a pack of 70 from Amazon for $18.90 (also available in four other styles). Promising reviews: "" This has been THEEE best product for my dry sensitive skin. These pads are brightening and helped my uneven skin texture . I didn’t know these pads would change my skin completely!! I’ll be repurchasing forever, best skincare product I’ve used in a long time, you NEED THIS! You’ll immediately notice a difference."" — Kenny Vasquez ""When I tell you my skin hasn’t been this clear in forever. I have PCOS and hirsutism, which causes me to grow hair on my neck and chin. I’m also a skin picker so clearing my skin has been really difficult for me. But this product has saved my skin . I’m still working on my skin picking but when I don’t, these pads help to exfoliate and help with the dark marks. Thank Anua!"" — Jessyca Renee Get it from Amazon for $22 . It can also help tighten the appearance of eye wrinkles if you'd prefer for them not to be as noticeable. And here's a tip! It reduces puffiness faster if used after refrigeration. Promising review: ""This is definitely a miracle product. I was impressed that it worked so well, so fast, and so instantly. The packaging is silly but whimsical; I enjoy it. This is the last thing I apply before walking out the door. First day I used it, I put it on and got in my car — I looked in the rear view mirror and my heart jumped. My eyes had de-puffed on my walk down the front path!!! So impressive. It's not hydrating, it’s more tightening/brightening. If you have dry under eyes, use a creamy hydrating eye cream first, and apply this over it — problem solved. You don’t get much product, but you don’t need to use much either, and it’s not like it’s expensive. Definitely worth it if a product actually DOES what it claims it’ll do!!! Buy it!"" — Joseph S. Get it from Amazon for $9.85 (available in three styles and in multipacks). This lip oil is vegan, cruelty free, and has no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. Promising review: ""This is the first lip oil I've ever used. Usually I avoid anything with oil because I have very sensitive and generally oilier skin, but I wanted to give this a try because I wanted something sheer and pretty for a natural makeup look. Probably the best purchase I've ever made!!! It's super sheer and looks fine on its own without any other makeup. The smell is delicious, and while the gloss dries and fades after about an hour or two without eating, the color stays all day! I did have to reapply after eating, but not after drinking water! I just wish it was bigger, it's a teeny bottle. Would definitely buy again!!"" — Rachel Get it from Amazon for $12 (available in 13 shades, a jumbo size, and multipacks). BTW, a lot of reviewers say they use this as part of their double cleansing routine. As the name implies, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the yucky stuff out of your pores. Promising reviews: ""BEST OIL CLEANSER I SWEAR. I’ve gone through 3–4 bottles now and it continues to cleanse my skin AMAZING. It melts makeup, clears pores. Honestly a heaven-send. The first time I used it, it cleared a lot of my sebum and even now when I use it, it clears any dead skin and dirt I have, even when I don’t wear makeup . BUY IT, it's amazing."" — rexichor ""Got it because it was all over my TikTok and I wanted to try the double cleansing. And wow, I don't regret it, it's amazing!!!! Leaves my skin so soft and so hydrated. I use it before my water base cleanser and it has helped me reduce my breakouts. I love the texture, the smell is very subtle (you can barely smell it) and I just love it."" — Linette González Get it from Amazon for $17.69 . Promising review: ""Let me tell you, I have awful blackheads, and this helped clean them out and made them a lot smaller. I love this stuff. I pair it with the oil cleanser (from the same brand and line), and they did wonders for my skin! I recommend it if you have clogged pores and blackheads."" — Nabi Get it from Amazon for $13 . This highly concentrated formula contains 96.3% snail secretion filtrate, which helps repair damage while moisturizing your skin. Also, the snail mucin is obtained in a safe way, so no snails are harmed! My colleague Gabriela Manjarrez can vouch for it: ""I've personally been using this for months now and it's amazing how it's improved aspects of my skin that I didn't even know needed improving. I didn't think my skin looked too dull before, but after seeing how this brightened and soothed my skin, I'm never going back. I spray my face with rose water, gently pat the essence into my skin while it's still damp, and let it absorb. Plus, it absorbs so quickly, it's like your skin is saying 'gimme gimme gimme!!'"" Promising review: ""I’ve been using this morning and night for about two weeks and I can say I understand the hype! My skin looks better than it has in so long. Firstly, the texture surprised me. When you think snail mucin, you think slimy and gross. This wasn’t sticky or slimy whatsoever. I was afraid it was gonna leave my skin feeling gross and slippery. Surprisingly, my skin drank it right up! No residue whatsoever and it’s a nice primer before makeup. I have oily skin and it’s helped with that as well. My skin is so soft, with a nice healthy glow. I’ve noticed my red spots from past acne are fading and my skin just overall looks great . Highly recommend!"" — Sarah Downs Get it from Amazon for $16.98 (also available as a two-pack). All Cosrx products are dermatologist-tested, cruelty-free, and have no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. Read more about tea tree oil and acne at Mayo Clinic . Promising review: ""After hours of exhaustive research on Korean gentle cleansers, I finally decided upon a cleanser. This was one of the best decisions I have ever made for my face! I have sensitive, combination, and very volatile skin, so if I ever make it unhappy, it definitely lets me know. This cleanser is light enough that it doesn't feel thick or cloying, it has a very subtle smell (which I love), and the pH of the cleanser is so low that the only thing I am worried about for my face anymore is the pH of the water I am splashing on my face. It hasn't caused any bad breakouts or negative reactions like drying or tightness of skin but it can certainly handle itself in the department of a full face cleanser. This has caused me to look forward to trying more Cosrx products!"" — Haley Hart Get it from Amazon for $11.90 . SeoulCeuticals is a small skincare business that was founded in 2017 by a husband and wife team. Though it's a US-based company and the products are made in a state-of-the-art US facility, their main ingredients are sourced directly from South Korea, and they work closely with Korean partners and their consultant Ella Cho to ensure quality and authenticity.

I look like a buttery roll or a glazed donut and I love it. My skin has never loved me more. I also pair this with their serum, along with a strict skincare routine."" — Victoria Del La Torre Get it from Amazon for $19.98 (available in two styles). P.S. This reviewer recommends putting the lid back on when not using because the air activates it. Promising reviews: "" I loved this! The fizzing effect exfoliated and deep cleaned my face….beyond facial smooth and bright ! It felt nice during the treatment. I really sensed DEEP cleaning! I think it will be a nice weekly treat! I highly recommend it for the fun experience and the amazing results."" — Amy Lynn Volansky ""I love love love this carbonated bubble clay mask! Ok so the packaging was very cute and simple, when opening up the jar, they give you this little spatula to help spread the mask. A little bit goes a long way ! The texture is jelly-like and smells decent. Once on your face, you can feel it tingling and cracking cause it's creating bubbles on your face. When done, your face itself looks like a huge bubble, it's quite fascinating. I kept the mask on for 10 minutes. Afterward, I used wet hands to rub the product in, then I washed with warm water. After using this, my face felt amazing! Super soft and shiny, not oily or grimy at all . Will definitely buy again, 10/10 :)"" — Erica Get it from Amazon for $9.80 . Promising review: "" This eye cream makes my eyes so soft, it has this luxurious feel that is better than any high-end product I have tried and for the cost? This stuff is unbelievable. I tried Ogee and all sorts of products that people swear by, but this one keeps my eyes hydrated and soft all night and lasts until the next day. It also isn’t greasy, which I love. Since it has retinol, I only put it on at night and use a Vitamin C serum by Murad in the morning. I love this product! You can feel and see a difference after one use."" — AJ Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (also available as a two-pack). Promising reviews: "" I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores, it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and are left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this good on everyone on the first try and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff.  🩷"" — Losa ""I have hyperpigmentation and oily skin. I feel this product regulates my oil production and it helps my makeup look so flawless. 10/10."" — MissKayMae Get it from Amazon for $19.90 (available in two sizes). Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""I struggle with finding a foundation that's not orange. Someone recommended I try a Korean product and this started going viral around the same time. I lucked into a perfect color match on the first try, but I've learned t here are sample packs if you aren't sure about the color. The coverage is incredible. It was very lightweight, not heavy at al l. It did settle into my under-eye wrinkles without primer so if you're older that's something to keep in mind. Overall beautiful and long-lasting. This will be my go-to foundation from now on ."" — AJ Bond Get it from Amazon for $28.75 (available in 40 shades, two sizes, a matte finish , a dewy finish , and sample kits to find your best shade match). Promising reviews: ""I almost want to gatekeep. By far THE best dry shampoo I’ve ever used — not sure how this sorcery works, but I’m obsessed!"" — Robertson ""I originally bought this for a month-long trip to Australia (that began with five days of camping without much time to stop by a store). I wanted something small and non-aerosol (because, travel), and hate applying powder by hand and didn't want to bring an application brush. The application sponge is great, and the powder itself is also magic. I was a DAILY hair washer most of my teenage and adult life, but now I can go an entire WEEK with this stuff (and other mindful habits like night braids). I really love it.""— Bre Get it from Amazon for $12.99 (available in six shades and in multipacks). Check out a TikTok of this mask in action. Most reviewers recommend doing this treatment once per week. Promising review : ""I am not too big on skincare, but I have been following this mask's hype on digital platforms. A couple of months back I ordered since the price tag is not bad. I live in Arizona, and it gets really dry here; this mask worked like magic. Helped me combat the dryness. The best part is you don't have to use it daily (unless you want baby skin). I use it once every week and it keeps my skin plumped the whole week. I take this with me during travel and put it while I am on the plane to not have jetlagged skin after. This review is coming from a toddler mom and a full-time worker, so you can imagine how much limited time I have for myself."" — Ms. W Get a four-pack from Amazon for $19 (also available in a 16-count and in two other styles). Promising review: ""After just two days of use, this adorable little octopus has done wonders for me, smells great too. Here's how I used it: I wore down the stick just a little to where the texture from the salt is visible, scrubbed around on my face so there was plenty of product, then I used my fingers to gently massage all the gunk away. Rinse, pat dry, and enjoy the softness. Highly recommended for people with sensitive skin like myself. "" — LuckLocust Get it from Amazon for $12.50 . After cleansing your skin, apply the essence using your hands (or a cotton pad) and wipe gently over your face. And don't forget to apply SPF afterward when using it in the morning! Promising reviews: "" My pores have always looked so huge, but after just a week using this, I can already see them shrinking down and becoming smaller . I was a little nervous about using an oil-like serum like this on my T-zone because I have combo skin and always get oily around my nose and chin, but it honestly hasn’t affected my skin whatsoever. There also isn’t really a scent to it, which is awesome. It leaves my skin feeling really moisturized."" — Berika Jones ""I decided to buy this instead of Paula’s Choice, It works great and it’s cheaper. It got rid of my T-zone blackheads and shrunk my pores . This also helped clear a breakout for me, but I mostly recommend it for people with blackheads and whiteheads. I have sensitive skin, and this doesn’t dry it out."" — Sophie Get it from Amazon for $18.07 . Promising review: ""Disclaimer: I went on Accutane five years ago, and this product is one of several other products in my day/night skincare routine. I first picked this up at an Olive Young store during a trip I took to South Korea. It was listed as one of their best-sellers and I 100% can see why. I mist my face before applying a few drops and it absorbs really quickly. Almost immediately, my skin looks/feels more hydrated and prepped for the rest of my routine . The days where I feel lazy and don’t complete my skincare routine or cheat and not use this, my face definitely looks less dewy/a little more dull. Idk but I’m sold for sure."" — Jaylen Get it from Amazon for $22.52 (also available as a two-pack). Krave Beauty is a Korean woman-owned small biz that aims to make skincare easy and stress-free. Promising review: ""I struggled with oily, acne-prone skin and a damaged barrier since I was a teenager. But I've been loyal to this cleanser and the oat moisturizer since they came out and y'all...it took some time, but my skin is finally, FINALLY, in the place I always wanted it to be. It has the perfect texture, amount of lather, and after-feel of any cleanser I've ever tried . Do your skin a favor and try this."" — Monisa A. Get it from Krave Beauty or Amazon for $16. And don't worry, even though this is a serum it won't leave you feeling like you just smeared olive oil over your face. Promising review: ""This stuff is amazing!!!!! The compliments I have received about my skin since I've started using this are [wild]. I have been told my skin looks even and that it has a glow. I don't wear makeup, so it is a huge confidence boost. I had some hyperpigmentation around my mouth, and it is almost gone. I use it in the morning and at night. I don't miss a day. I feel consistency is key with this product. There is not really a scent and I like the texture because it is not watery but not thick either. I'm almost out, so I will be buying another bottle. Also, I had no irritation or breakouts and my pores have got smaller and non-existent in some areas."" — Christina Pope Get it from Amazon for $16.50 . Elizabeth Mott is a Korean American woman-owned biz! Promising review: ""So let me start by saying I have used nearly every eyeshadow primer available. From high end to low...they don't hold a candle to Thank Me Later. I have very oily skin. Using this primer, shadow lasts a full eight hours or more. I could get maybe five or six out of the other brands if I was lucky. I got this as a sample in my Ipsy bag, and I had to buy the full-size product straight away! I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you, Elizabeth Mott, for finally making a primer that lasts! I love this stuff!"" — Melissa Mae Get it from Amazon for $15.35 . Promising review: ""I wore this primer under my foundation ( Nars and Maybelline Fit Me ) along with setting spray ( Nyx ) in this photo [above right]. I had been dunked in the pool two times and went down a giant slide that caused you to go underwater three times. This was the result of my makeup ! Love this product. A little goes a long way!"" — Ryan Brooks Get it from Amazon for $15.60 (available in four other styles and in bundle packs). Promising review: ""Magic in a freaking bottle. I love this product. I was hesitant to buy and start a new addition to my skincare routine but I said F it and bought it on a whim. WELL I AM SO GLAD I DID. Pores, wrinkles, and fine lines are minimized, hydration on point, and it smells AMAZING. Yes the texture is water-based, and when I woke up the next day — WOW I WAS GLOWING!!! It's been a few weeks on this now and I have to say I will continue to buy it. I rinse with water and then put a dropper full on each cheek and rub it all over my face and follow it with sunscreen. FREAKING GLOWWWWWWWINGGGGGG. I am obsessed with this product and just the scent alone throws me into an amazing start to my day. Heaven in a bottle. YUM!!!!!!!"" — Clayt Get it from Amazon for $19.98 . Check out this TikTok of the balm in action. Promising review: ""Okay! So I was skeptical at first, but honestly, this stick is life changing!! ! In a matter of minutes, my skin felt hydrated and plumped. After an hour, still hydrated. No greasy after feeling, very light, and you can feel your skin hydrated and absorbing. I love the fact that you can use it on your eyes, lips, and wrinkles!! Game changer for me, will def try the others!"" — Kristy Get it from Amazon for $22.99 (available in five styles). Promising review: ""I have struggled with acne my entire life. I’ve gone to dermatologists, tried salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, tazarotene, and nothing ever even reduced it. I struggled with a very basic form of acne on my forehead, and sometimes my chin, and I have sensitive skin so I decided to try something new. I thought I’d have to wait at least a month to see results but within four days, everything started to disappear. All of my major acne has completely gone away , I only see little tiny spots here and there but they go away within a day. Nothing like what I used to get. I'm going to start using it on my back to see if it helps there too. 10/10 the best face wash I have ever encountered in my life ."" — Jaiden Get it from Amazon for $12 (available in two sizes).

As a [person] of color, finding a sunscreen that didn’t give me a white cast / ashy finish was very hard, so I am so glad I’ve come across this product! It goes on the skin so smoothly. I apply moisturizer first, then the sunscreen, and have no trouble spreading a little over my entire face! I seriously don’t leave the house without this; I keep it on me at all times! It gives you a glow and makes skin feel so much softer. I also feel like some of my dark spots have faded due to this product! Also I have VERY sensitive skin, so everything breaks me out, but this has not! "" — Sierra Keyes Get it from Amazon for $18+ (available in two sizes).

And now, ever since using it, I honestly swear by it. If you are considering trying the Peach & Lily collection products, I 100% recommend this serum repeatedly.

I've been using this toner for over a month now. I use it twice a day. My face has improved 110%. It removed dirt even after washing my face & I haven't had any serious breakouts or skin bumps since. I have more confidence in my natural face and am loving it!

I’m combination, but run dry, and this keeps me evened out even in winter."" — fannbea6 ""This mask is the best!! Your skin will feel hydrated and soft. It is a great overnight reset moisturizer.

However, we are larger fans of BHG's uncompromising value, quality, and design. The chairs are remarkably well made. The swivel is smooth. The fabric is sturdy yet supple. This is a must-have piece for any home."" — BiggE Price: $248+ (available in seven colors) Promising review: ""LOVE!! Super easy to put together, and you don't need two people to stand it up. Looks chic and modern."" — Anonymous Price: $246.37 (originally $302.64) Promising review: ""Great quality and design, sturdy, and easy to assemble. Well made. All wood, with the exception of the sustaining cross bar being metal, which gives it that extra sturdiness. The cushion adds that extra comfort. I was able to assemble it within minutes."" — Sandra Price: $115 (available in two colors) Promising review: ""As pictured...cute, durable, and fits the outside of the door perfectly!"" — Loranna Price: $20+ (available in two sizes and six colors) The set includes four dinner plates, four salad plates, and four bowls. Promising review: ""I am OBSESSED with these dishes! I saw them online and ordered them immediately. The quality is amazing. I love the weight of them. The pattern is beautiful, and I love the coordinating pieces. I also ordered a set of coffee mugs and some appetizer plates. They were delivered quickly and packaged nicely to keep all the pieces from breaking. I would love to order more dinner and salad plates and pick them up curbside at my local Walmart. Thank you for a beautiful product!"" — April Price: $54+ (available in two colors and as a three-pack) Promising review: ""I love this chair! It looks just how it does online. The workmanship seems very solid, and the structure is of better quality than I expected. I love spending time working from home in this lovely chair whenever I get a chance. Very satisfied with my purchase."" — JW Price: $247 (originally $297, available as a single or two-pack) Promising review: ""I love this ottoman! Honestly, it's exactly what I'm looking for. You can store blankets and stuff inside, which is a bonus, and it's so soft. I'll sit on it when watching TV."" — Erika Price: $47.80 (available in two colors) Promising review: ""It was the biggest and widest mirror I could find in this arch shape. Beautiful and worth it. Heavy and sturdy. You can lean it or hang it on a wall."" — Viviana Price: $348 (originally $398) Promising review: ""We have this in our bedroom. It looks quite natural for a faux tree. Very dense leaves. The pot is very small, so it will fit in pretty much any decorative pot. The photo shows the shape accurately. The prices were very good."" — jlwether Price: $79.11+ (available in four sizes) Promising review: ""I love these cabinets. I'm redoing my master bathroom with an industrial/boho vibe, and these worked perfectly for my storage needs. These were surprisingly easy to assemble; each cabinet took less than 20 minutes, and I did them myself. Once assembled, they are heavy, so I needed sliders to move them in place. I bought the orange ones, and they are the perfect orange, which is one of my very favorite decorating colors."" — Mary Price: $128.98+ (originally $204.99, available in four colors) Promising review: ""I love this storage box. It fits perfectly under my bed, and I was able to fit approximately 10 pairs of shoes. The wheels make it easy to slide in/out of the bed, and I don't have to open the whole lid since it folds in the middle."" — Maritza Price: $8.64+ (available in two sizes and as a two-pack or six-pack) Promising review: ""I love this vacuum! It was easy to set up on Wi-Fi and I have it scheduled to clean every day at 11:00. My floors really look nice. The dirt collecting bin is easy to empty and holds quite a bit. It is very quiet and runs a long time before it self-docks. My dog isn't afraid of it. The price is affordable and well worth the money."" — Roma Price: $115 (originally $249) Promising review: ""This thing is awesome for people with allergies! I've been sneezing for MONTHS. Finally had enough when I had a sneeze attack at 3 a.m. Went and got this that day, and I have not sneezed since. I set it to turn on from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. so it clears the air before I go to bed and while I sleep, but you can let it go all day. The app is awesome! Tells you the filter life, and you can control it from the app. Also, side note it has a plant tracker and will tell you when to water your plants as well, which I found awesome! So glad I bought this. I feel 100% better. ZERO sneezing and coughing now from allergies."" — Courtney Price: $89.98 Promising review: ""The BEST cooler I've ever had. We went to the beach, and it was perfect! It kept the food/drinks fresh and cold for the whole day. Plus, it's the perfect size for two people. Easy to clean and superrrrr cute."" — Jess Price: $39.98 (originally $49.99) Promising review: ""Have repurchased this item many times! Favorite and only closet organizer I'll use, and I've tried many brands. The quality is 10/10 and very sturdy. Love the pockets on the sides for extra storage, too! I also use these as a hack in hotel rooms. They collapse flat for easy suitcase travel, and then create a whole dresser in tiny hotel closets."" — becauseimelena Price: $18.66 (also available in a four-pack) Each set includes four 14.10 x 5.40 x 12.10-inch bins. Promising review: “These were perfect for organizing my refrigerator. All my wayward condiments, bottles, vegetables, eggs, and bread are always in their place and easy to access without playing refrigerator Tetris!” — Deborah Price: $19.97 for four (also available as a three-pack) Promising review: “I love these hangers. My closet is so much more organized. Gained more space. Nothing falls off the hangers and unlike plastic ones, they don't get tangled up together when I put them between each other. I actually ordered 30 more to complete two closets."" — TERI Price: $9.98+ for 30 (available in six colors and also in a pack of 100) Promising review: ""I absolutely love the hamper! It's a game-changer for keeping my laundry organized. The two dividers make sorting clothes so easy — one side for lights, the other for darks. The removable laundry bags are a convenient feature, especially when it's time to head to the laundry room. The hamper is also collapsible, so it doesn't take up too much space when not in use. Plus, the dark gray color looks sleek and modern in my bedroom. It's sturdy, well-designed, and the handles make it easy to carry. Highly recommend for anyone looking to simplify their laundry routine!” — Heather Price: $22.09 (originally $39.99, available in two colors) According to Johns Hopkins , you may want to avoid diffusing oils around larger groups and young children because of the side effects of different oils. You may also want to avoid using an oil diffuser around pets with breathing problems, according to the ASPCA . Promising review: ""It has a timer, and the light is adjustable. It works great!"" — Kay Price: $26.53 Promising review: ""Love that this trash can is hands-free and so far I've had no issues with odors.

Béis is a woman-owned travel accessories brand founded by actress and entrepreneur Shay Mitchell. You'll find carry-on rollers, weekender bags, packing cubes, and more practical goods for your next trip! Promising review: ""Flawless! I am obsessed with this luggage. I ordered the three-piece set and the weekender bag ! The zipper slot to slip the bag over the luggage handle makes loading and trekking through the airport so much easier. The interior of all pieces are great quality and I love the small touches (pockets, laundry bags, etc.) Zippers are all sturdy and the locks are very easy to use. A++!"" — Lisa B. Get it from Béis for $368 (available in 13 colors and also in two smaller sizes). Check it out on TikTok here . Promising review: ""I bought this a few months ago when I knew I'd be flying across the country (more or less) twice this past spring/summer; it was the first new luggage I had bought in about 25 years. I've taken the set on several trips now — two round-trip flights with plane changes, a couple of two-night road-trip hotel stays, a six-day 1,800-mile road trip, and a mandatory wildfire evacuation, and I really, really like it. It rolls like a dream on hard floors, sidewalks, and parking lots — makes it easy for two people to manage three suitcases, each with a laptop bag or duffel attached. The bright red color (my favorite shade of red) really pops and makes it easy to pick out of a luggage carousel. It's lightweight and goes in and out of a hatchback with ease. This set truly makes travel even more fun. Well worth the money."" — Rachel Get it from Amazon for $179.99+ (available in 22 colors). Promising review: ""I love this thing! I always hated putting things in the seat pocket on planes. It was easy for things to get lost in there or sometimes the pockets were pretty tight. This thing was amazing. I was able to get everything out of my bag that I might need during the flight and had easy access to it all . It was so much better than having to pull my bag out constantly to get stuff I needed. It also folds up nicely so it doesn’t take up much space in your bag."" — Corey Get it from Amazon for $29.99 . Promising reviews: ""I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who travels, especially internationally, because of all the extra costs for going over in weight. We were among the few people in line who didn’t need to rearrange our luggage at the airport to meet the weight requirements in Milan . So easy to pack and take with you."" — Addison ""This little device was well worth the money spent. It saved us a lot of money on our flight home since we knew the weight was over and could pre-purchase the overage in the app instead of paying double at the airport. I’ll never travel without it!! Very easy to use."" — Michael Ellis Get it from Amazon for $8.54+ (available in four colors and also as a two-pack). This product is formulated without parabens, phthalates, petrolatum, or SLS. Promising review : ""I’ve been using this product for years now. My first trip to Costa Rica I had it and trust me when I tell you it’s saved my life. I live in Florida now and I never go anywhere without it. After any time in the sun you can use this and you can believe that your skin will be nourished and moisturized it will not hurt and your skin will not peel if used properly . I said your skin will not peel. I love this product for it."" — Kenneth Get it from Amazon for $9.01+ (available in two sizes). Check it out in this TikTok . Promising reviews: ""I needed a new travel wallet, and this holds everything I need all in one place, and it still closes nicely and stays flat! I can fit my boarding pass, passport, ID, credit cards, money, checked baggage tickets, receipts, and more in it, yet it doesn’t bulk up or look like an overstuffed mess. It's just amazing. The description says it only holds US money, but I just used the boarding pass flap to hold all my Japanese Yen, which are larger. I didn’t use the zippered pocket for coins as I much prefer a separate coin purse for that sort of thing. I definitely recommend to anyone who travels a lot!"" — Anthony Luu ""I purchased this wallet for my recent trip to Orlando to keep my cash, credit cards, ID, boarding pass, itinerary, etc. It held so many items I was shocked! I saved so much space in my purse by using this wallet. I will never travel without it! "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 36 colors). Promising review: "" I took my kids on their first international trip, and this thing was a total lifesaver. It fits easily in a fanny pack or small purse for easy access, and it fit my whole family's passports, vaccine cards, boarding passes, and a pen with plenty of room for cash and cards if you decide to use it as a wallet for your trip. It made getting checked in a breeze and helped my family keep everything organized."" — Kevin Garcia Get it from Amazon for $8.49+ (available in five colors). Reviewers say it's ideal for a suitcase that can roll on four wheels! If you have a suitcase that has to tilt while it rolls, just be careful if the drinks are open at the top. Check it out on TikTok here . Promising review : ""This cup holder is perfect! It helps me a lot! Last time I took a plane with a suitcase and a cup of coffee, I dropped and spilled my drink everywhere when it was my turn to check my passport and ticket. It was a nightmare! This time, I bought this cup holder to do me a favor! I don't have to worry about where my cup and phone are! I can free my hands to do other things. I love it so much! Hope you love it too."" — Philip Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 27 colors and patterns). Promising reviews: ""I bought this as a purse for traveling to populated European cities as there are heaps of pickpockets. It worked perfectly! It is the perfect size to fit everything I need and was super comfortable . Highly recommend."" — Jessie Anela ""I bought this fanny pack to take on our trip to San Francisco and it worked out better than I thought it would! We hiked through Muir Woods and I loved that my hands were free from holding a purse! Then we walked across the Golden Gate Bridge, went to Chinatown, the wharf, etc. and again it was great not having to hold anything. This is by far the best bag I've ever traveled with. It is almost the same exact size a (name brand) bag but a lot less. Best purchase for the vacation :)"" — Pat Get it from Amazon for $11.98 (available in 40 colors). Unlike the regular U-shaped pillows, Trtl Pillows are machine-washable and fast-drying. Check it out on TikTok here . Promising review: ""Used it for a 14-hour flight to Japan last week, and it helped tremendously. This was the first time I was able to sleep on the plane so this helped tremendously. Definitely a must-have for travel. It is very light so I was able to easily pack it in my under-the-seat wheeled trolley. I want to emphasize how much the light warmth of the fleece (and I don't like being hot) was just right to help me nod off to sleep. Since this is primarily for sitting upright in the seat or someone in the middle or the aisle seat, this was ideal for me. I just got back yesterday. Again I used it — this time for a 12-hour flight."" — Ambience Get it from Amazon for $64.99 (available in five colors). The pillow is made with a breathable, super soft bamboo fabric, and fully machine washable. Promising review: "" We got a few different types of travel pillows for a red-eye to Europe and this was overall our favorite due to its versatility. The loop actually allows you to have various self supporting positions, and this will contort all sorts of ways to be a pillow, neck rest, arm rest… anything. It’s actually just good for any type of travel in general and got a lot of use on the whole trip. The material is soft and comfortable."" — Tom Shaw Get it from Amazon for $54.50 (available in nine colors). Promising reviews: ""I have sensitive skin, so I am particular about my face products. I travel for work two to four times per year and usually once for vacation, and try to avoid bringing so much liquid due to restrictions. I can bring these and leave both my face and eye cleaner at home. They are great for use in flight on long overseas legs, in your seat. No need to disturb anyone or spend extra time in the overused, tiny bathroom. I have never broken out, and they don’t bother my eyes. I do use my normal face lotion after these, unless on the plane. They don’t leave your skin dry."" — Andrea Louise ""I use these for travel and freshening up on the plane before landing or whenever I am hot and am not in a place where I can wash my face. They are wonderful. I used to buy the big packs but found them awkward to carry. With these, I throw a bunch in my travel pack and I am off. Love them! "" — BrianM_NJ Get a 20-pack from Amazon for $6.88 (available in two sizes). Promising review: "" These headphones are a game-changer. As an avid music enthusiast, frequent traveler, and love of movies in a loud and busy household, these headphones have improved my audio experiences in ways I never knew were possible. First and foremost, the noise cancellation is unparalleled. The moment you put these on, the outside world fades away. However, it still offers the ability to be aware of your surroundings when needed without stoping your audio. If you are traveling you don't need to worry about the headphones going out on you, because the battery life is incredible. As with all Bose products the craftmanship and quality is top-notch. I have been hesitant to purchase Bose headphones in the past because I just didn't think that I would be able to tell enough of a difference. I was wrong. I am beyond excited to have these headphones, and it has added so much to my entertainment enjoyment. "" — P.O. Get them from Amazon for $399 (available in five colors). Promising review: ""These headphones are great! They have a nice shape and comfort and sound isolation that serves my kid well on a 10-hour flight with other screaming kids. These headphones have great sound isolation that make it still possible for my kid to listen during plane rides despite volume limitation, and also able to ignore four other screaming, tantruming toddlers in our cabin. I was just about to dig deeper in my pockets to buy much more expensive headphones for my kids, but these worker great with a nice budget! They fold compactly, so they were easy to pack. The cord had a nice fabric soft feel. Highly recommend for travel."" — Elizabert Get them from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""These were the things I never knew I needed for traveling. They work just as advertised and are really useful when going on a trip. I always hate at the end of a trip having to mix dirty and clean clothes — a 'laundry bag' or plastic shopping bag never really felt like a good enough separation . These bags seal up and conceal the most stinky, wet clothes from your clean unused clothes. They are going to be one of my new necessities for my big family when traveling. "" — Sarbello Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.98 . Check them out in this TikTok . Promising review: "" I have seen the packing cubes all over TikTok and thought I would give it a try. I packed 10 days of outfits in two medium pouches. I took it all out and packed my clothes in my suitcase alone. The cubes are so much better. I used the two medium and my boyfriend used the large and small. We got 10 days of clothes each — in one carry on suitcase. They even allowed for enough room to put two pairs of Sandler and a pair of slides. I will never travel without these cubes again. "" — Amazon Customer Get a set of six from Amazon for $29.99 (available in 29 colors). Promising review: ""I've been a big fan of this lip balm for about seven years. It keeps my lips super hydrated. I live in a cold climate, and as a flight attendant I'm in a super dry environment for 8+ hours a day. I swear by this product. My favorite flavor is the Mint, solely for the fact I don't really like tasting fruity flavors on my lips, especially while I'm masked up. It's so good that if I run out of it, I'd rather do without than get something else. Good thing it's available on Prime!"" — Joseph M Get it from Amazon for $10 (available in six flavors and in packs of three). Check out this TikTok of it in action. Promising reviews: "" I love travel razor! I go on a lot of trips for work and pleasure, and I like to keep my toiletries organized and minimal. This is a perfect size for my toiletry bag. The handle is big enough that it doesn’t interfere in the use of the razor, and the case is a great bonus. I’ll never travel without this again. "" — Joanne ""I bought this originally for traveling, but quickly switched to using it at home as well. I feel like you have a lot more control when your hand is closer to the blade, I cut myself way less with this than a regular razor. Also the case is great, not just for the plane, but also so much better than those dumb flimsy suction cup hooks they give you. Blades seem to last longer because they're slightly more protected."" — Lena V Get it from Amazon for $10 . EverSnug is a small business that sells travel sleeping care kits. Check it out on TikTok here . Promising review: ""I ordered two of these and my daughter and I both use them numerous times while flying recently. They compact nicely, have a loop that can go through the handle of a carry-on, and are the perfect size for snuggling up and sleeping on the airplane. It is lightweight and I will not fly again without it!"" — SweetMama Get it from Amazon for $29.95 (available in seven colors). Promising reviews : "" The BEST BEST BEST and most comfortable sleep mask I’ve found. Night shifter for years, and have tried everything. Many other sleep masks have some qualities but not all. This one is AMAZINGLY SOFT, VERY THICK, plush, high quality material, quality stitching that won’t come apart like so many others that are cheaply made, and it’s EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE even though it’s a good price. Very impressed and pleasantly surprised."" — . ""I loved it so much, I bought a second for my boyfriend! We both travel so much that sometimes you end up in a hotel room where the blinds still let in light, and this blocks it out without compressing your eyelids where it feels like you’re being forced to keep them shut. I love that the compression contours around your eye so that you can open your eyes without feeling like you’re restricted. I love it so much I sleep with it at home now and I never travel without it! "" — Jordann Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in eight colors). Check them out on TikTok here . BuzzFeed Shopping editor Emma Lord swears by these and raves: ""The moldable silicone of Mack's Earplugs contours easily to the shape of your ear to block out noise much more effectively than other foam or plastic varieties, and the noise reduction is so good that if I pair them with a white noise machine (or just like a white noise loop on Spotify) I genuinely don't hear noises from outside my room. Not only that, but once they're in place, they stay locked there until you decide to pull them out. Granted, I can still hear my alarm, and like, if the fire alarm went off or something, I'd definitely wake right up. But noises that are distant and loud are pretty easily canceled out by these. I've also *loved* these for traveling — if you put these babies in on a plane not only does it help reduce some of the YIKES factor when the plane takes off (it's loud!!), but it cancels out the murmuring noises of passengers on the flight and makes it easier to get some shuteye. "" Get 12 pairs from Amazon for $12.99 . For more info on melatonin, visit The Mayo Clinic . As someone who has a hard time napping at home (much less on a plane), I have been using these tablets for years now. I can't say enough about how well they work at giving you a soft, sleepy feeling without making you feel heavy or drowsy. They also seem to last FOREVER. Personally, I'll take even half the tablet and I'm off to Dreamland. The yummy berry taste is also a bonus, and I wake up feeling rested and refreshed! Promising review: ""I travel internationally frequently and constantly struggle with jet lag. I've tried many different melatonin sleep aid pills. And while many of them do help somewhat, the these melatonin tablets have consistently worked the best. They work fast and give me a full nights sleep. I highly recommend them."" — Just Joe Get a pack of 180 tablets from Amazon for $8.29 (also available as a 300-pack). Tower 28 is an Asian woman-owned business designed for sensitive skin. Their products are free of any sensitivity-causing ingredients, and are also vegan and cruelty-free. Promising review: ""So, I love this thing. I usually end up with horrible skin after flying. Especially if it's a long haul flight. So now I spritz this on my face during the flight a few times and I arrive at my destination with fantastic skin. One day I boarded the plane with my skin already broken out, some pimples and all, and by the end of the flight, it was all gone. It's a miracle worker!!!"" — FabsConti Get it from Tower 28 or from Sephora for $12+ (available in three sizes). See it in action on TikTok here . Promising review : ""I bought this nifty gadget about six months ago for a multileg, ultra-long-haul trip, and it more than held up the entire duration . I was able to finagle it to fit the tray tables on different planes, and like others, I find the height just nice when clamped onto a stowed tray table . It also works on my roller carry-on handle during layovers. However, I find myself using it a lot outside of travel too! Work-wise, I've clamped it onto my office desk shelving to hold my phone at eye level beside my computer . At home, I simply clamped it to a deck of cards, and it turns into a versatile stand that I can place on any flat surface. Heck, I've been using it to hold my phone comfortably at eye level while watching videos in bed. It's extremely well built, and I find myself fidgeting with it all the time. Thus far it still feels solid, and I don't anticipate breaking it any time soon. Even if it does break, I'll be happy to buy another one or two of it!"" — Earendil Get it from Amazon for $13.97+ (available in seven colors and multipacks). You know how everyone has those little items that are permanently in their carry-on bag? This is one of them for me. Being able to get some nice airflow wherever I go has been so amazing, I can never go back. And not even just for travel! I also take it to amusement parks, on hikes, and even use it throughout my makeup routine to help set products in place. Plus, the battery life it *top tier*. Promising review: ""This thing was a godsend while I was in Florida in the summertime. Love that it has a flashlight and you can use it as a backup power bank in a pinch. For me this fit all my needs, it kept me cool in Florida, fit perfectly in my purse/backpack and on my wrist. I pretty much took this wherever I went and even used it on the plane during boarding when it was super hot in there. I’m giving this 5 stars, it worked perfect for me."" — Erica Get it from Amazon for $15.29+ (available in six colors). Promising review: ""This little gem is amazing! This year, we were fortunate enough to do some local traveling and attend quite a few concerts . I take a ton of videos and pictures, often draining the battery. This power-packed product charged not only my phone when it was low, but my boyfriend’s AND the girl next to her!! Since you can only take small bags into venues, this slipped right into the pocket behind my phone! We had numerous comments on it because of the little paw charge indicator. The flashing came in handy a few times when we found ourselves in the dark! I will be buying more and giving them as gifts this year!"" — Annetastic Get it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""LOVE this adapter! I travel from time to time internationally and have always used just the 'standard' adapters found in airports. Could not pass up the opportunity to purchase this one after reading the reviews. Exceeded my expectations of what it was capable of. Used on a recent trip to Germany and it handled everything needed — laptop, cell phone (USB ports are so very welcome), alarm clock, dryer, etc. Did not miss a beat on the power provided. And, it is also attractive looking ;-) Thank you for making such a great, dependable product!"" — Monkey Get it from Amazon for $17.99 . Promising review: "" I will never fly again without this. I've recommended it to everyone. East coast USA to South East Asia, 24 hours in long haul flights each way with serious low back pain condition to start. But being able to hang my legs, even in a sideways position, saved me from hours of pain that I have endured previously flying with economy leg room. So easy to loop over tray table brackets in both the stowed and open position. This is a must have for any flight."" — DL Flin Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (also available in multipacks). Promising reviews: "" I saw this on TikTok and purchased it for my trip! Got back home and use it in my own bathroom. I love it that much! Best Amazon purchase I’ve ever made!"" — Amazon Customer ""I bought this bag specifically for when I travelled across the country with my two small children. One of whom is a medically complex child. I put ALL of my toiletries, ALL their toiletries, and ALL of my son's medications in this bag. Everything fit perfectly, and nothing was broken. The hanger is durable and carried lots of weight when it hanged on the back of the bathroom door. I bought the largest size, and it was 100% worth what I paid for. If you are traveling by yourself, I would recommend the smaller size. But if you are packing for others or just pack heavy, definitely buy the larger size. I absolutely loved it! And it was very compact in my suitcase. Very sturdy as I carried it. I HIGHLY recommend buying."" — Hannah Funderburk Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in two sizes and nine colors). Promising review: ""I went on a long trip overseas and visited a number of less than sanitary areas. These were total lifesavers. My coworkers used them too. Wonderful. Plus they're small enough to take on the plane. The TSA didn't even insist I put it in a quart-sized bag."" — Kris Jennings Get an eight-pack from Amazon for $14.99 (also available as a pack infused with essential oils! ). Promising review: "" This will carry four frozen breastmilk bags and keep them frozen six to eight hours, which is perfect for domestic airport travel or small outings. I like to bring a few extra bags with me on trips for a night out or if it will be hard to nurse somewhere. Awesome product and less bulky that other cooler bags."" — Joshua Get it from Amazon for $17.99 (available in 13 colors and prints). Promising review: ""I purchased one for myself and had a really good experience traveling with them. Nothing leaked, not even the witch hazel. I was really impressed and bought two more for my daughters and took them on our family vacation. We love these travel kits."" — M Get it from Amazon for $12.99 . Before I started using these a couple of years ago, my ears would *always* start to hurt when the plane started to descend. I'd have to press my fingers on my ears and be chewing on gum just to try to dissuade some of the discomfort. Now, as soon as the captain announces they are starting the descent, I put these in my ears (BTW, they're surprisingly comfortable!), put my headphones on over them, and can actually enjoy the last half hour of my flight. Promising review: ""I am very sensitive to the change in pressure on airplanes, to the point where I am in tears on takeoff and landing. I finally had to do something about it or I would fear flying again. I wish I had known about these years ago. They alleviated ALL sensitivity to the pressure change and made for a very comfortable and anxiety-free flight. I can't recommend them enough."" — Nancy Cardella Get a pair from Amazon for $7.89 (also available in multipacks and in kids' sizes ). Reviewers swear by these nonmedicated bands for nausea relief: they've used them while traveling on airplanes, boats, and cars and for morning sickness during pregnancies. Read more about acupressure and nausea at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . Check the bands out on TikTok here . Promising review: ""I bought these for an upcoming cruise, but thought I would try them out when flying (as I tend to get motion sickness even after taking Dramamine). I was very surprised that I had no motion sickness after wearing these on two different work trips. I also took these on a cruise and only had to use them once. Once I felt the motion sickness coming on, I put on the bands and the sickness was gone in about 15 minutes. They came in a nice plastic case and are reusable."" — Jessica Get a two-pack from Amazon for $8.53 (available in five colors). Promising review: ""My family goes to Disney World every year, and even with rotating shoes every other day, we still get blisters. I bought this before our trip two months ago, and it was worth every penny. We rubbed it all over the top, bottom, sides of our feet and toes each morning, and our feet did not blister! I highly recommend this product for long Disney days or any time you will be on your feet for a long period of time."" — Cari Sanders Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in packs of two). It also comes with a USB-C charging cable, travel pouch, keychain holder, quick-start guide, and a manual. Traveling with a family member or friend? They can also sync their earbuds to this gadget! See one TikTok user using it with their AirPod Pros here . Promising review: ""Ever since I purchased my wireless Bose earbuds, I always hated having to use another set when I was on an airplane with the seat-back entertainment system. I tried many different models to connect the system to my Bluetooth headsets until I came across this one, and it is amazing! It seamlessly connects to my headset, very clear and reliable audio, and it takes the stress away from having to carry more than one headset! Thank you!!!"" — Ryan Malloy Get it from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in five styles and four colors). Promising review: ""This is perfect. Whenever we travel, my kids always say 'make me a list of what I have to pack.' I always worry I will forget to tell them something random like underwear or pajamas...so now, I just check the boxes , they pack, and can review the list if they want to add anything."" — AmyH Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in a road trip edition). Promising review: ""I can't say enough good things about this travel duffel bag; it's been an absolute game changer for my trips. I've taken it on several journeys, including some rough adventures, and it still looks as good as new. The size is just perfect — it holds a surprising amount of stuff while remaining compact enough to fit in overhead compartments or under seats on flights . The compartments and pockets help keep everything organized, which is a lifesaver when you're on the go. The quality of the zippers and handles is top-notch . The shoulder strap is comfortable, and the option to carry it as a backpack is a fantastic feature. It's great for weekend getaways, business trips, or even as a gym bag. I've used many travel bags in the past, but this one truly stands out in terms of quality and functionality. It's become my go-to travel companion, and I wouldn't travel without it. If you're in need of a reliable, stylish, and spacious travel duffel, look no further. This bag is a winner! "" — Liz Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in 62 colors/styles).

No difference I can tell from the Solo Stove , excellent quality. Gives off a good amount of heat, too."" — S Robles Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in two sizes and three colors). This comes with all the hardware you need to hang it! Promising review: ""Absolutely love this hammock chair!!! It looks beautiful in my garden, and my friends love to sit in it when they come over."" — Kat Payne Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""All the varieties grew, and I was very impressed by how they stayed nice and neat when planted in a row. I used them to edge one side of my garden. Several strong storms came through this summer and didn't break even one! They drew all types of pollinators: bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds."" — Taryn Fellinger Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Promising review: ""I am thoroughly delighted with these flamingos. They're perfect for enhancing my pool area. The solar lighting that maintains its glow throughout the night is a notable advantage."" — Magdaia Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (also available in packs of two). Promising review: ""I rarely write product reviews, but this has far exceeded my expectations. I saw my first-ever oriole a few weeks ago. He was here and then gone. Decided to get a feeder. I was unsure how this would work. I bought two. Put out the oranges and put grape jelly in the cups. Day one: Nothing. But on the second day, I had tons! Every day since, I have had at least 7–14 birds and am going through a ton of grape jelly."" — Amazoncustomer Get it from Amazon for $15.03 . Promising review: ""This is seriously the best 'lounge tanning chair' I have ever had! I don’t have a pool, and most days I have some time to lie out and enjoy the sun for an hour or two. This thing is soooo comfortable, and the pillow is perfect! Just add however much water you want to keep cool, get your favorite playlist out and a refreshing drink, and get your tan on in your backyard or deck! Buy it! It’s worth every penny."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in two sizes and nine colors). It doesn't require a pump either — all you have to do is whisk it through the air to blow it up. It's suggested that you close the sleeve opening before ending each movement and keep the mouth closed until you begin the next one. Once there's enough air inside, you'll be good to go! Promising review: ""I'm in love with this product! I’ve been using it every day to chill outside, and it’s great! It's easy to set up, set down, and it's super comfy."" — Alexus Get it from Amazon for $37.98+ (available in 20 styles). Promising review: ""I love this! It’s well-painted, and the solar light works great. It is the cutest thing on my patio table."" — solowithpits Get it from Amazon for $20.98 . Promising review: ""We bought this for a rather large umbrella over our table in the backyard and used it for the first time last night. We were less concerned about mosquitoes because we have a service to eliminate them — it's the bees that were disturbing our outdoor meals and events. My wife hosted a few friends last night, and they all fell in love with this. They've all been fighting with bees lately, and they were not bothered once by any bugs . Every friend bought the netting on the spot – you're welcome to the company that manufactures this product. Also, when you're inside the netting sitting on chairs, it's almost as if the netting is invisible; most of the time, you can't tell whether it's even there, especially at night."" — Sara Olshansky Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in two colors). Promising reviews: ""Love love love it. We have had 3 inches of rain in the last week, and the cushion was dry today when I went out to get in the pool. Definitely would recommend.

They still look brand-new. They are a great buy."" — Teresa Butts Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in four sizes and colors). Promising review: ""This butterfly house is adorable.

Promising review: ""Love this little pollinator house! I wasn’t sure it was attracting them at first, but the next time I looked, a bunch of the tubes were sealed off. The bees seem happy, and my garden is doing great."" — Jenna Preston Get it from Amazon for $12.01+ (available in two colors). Promising review: ""Doesn’t disrupt nearby plants. For weeds with long roots like bindweed, follow along the weed's root. You’ll get a feel for it with practice. The tip has a sharper angle than my last one, so it's good for cutting the roots of shallow-rooted plants. It’s a game-changer, for sure. Good, sturdy, well-made, and has a comfortable handle."" — Hanna Get it from Amazon for $28.98 . Grampa's Gardenware Co. is a family-owned small business that makes products that make the gardening, weeding, or harvesting of your land a little easier. Promising review : ""Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim, given my husband, and I bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard, and boy, has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard, and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun, but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get."" — JG Get it from Amazon for $39.97 . Promising review: ""This sail worked perfectly to provide morning and afternoon shade and looks fabulous. I like the way the design looks.

Croft Get it from Amazon for $43.99+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""I had two last year and was so impressed with how sturdy they are. The flowers and veggies grew much better, and no slugs or snails. Bought four more! My 10- and 6-year-old grandsons put them together with just some initial instruction. In less than three hours. WELL worth the money."" — M Get it from Amazon for $29.69+ (available in five sizes and four colors). Promising reviews: ""So, I love this. I bought it to use for my Confederate jasmine bush, to train it, and it's been perfect. It got tipped over during Hurricane Helene, and it STAYED TOGETHER, if that tells y'all anything.

I fill up the reservoir and I'm done!"" — cmarego Get it from Amazon for $36.79 . Reviewers note that you should take the bulbs out before hanging the strings up! Promising review: ""Very nice set of lights for the price. I bought a number of sets in various lengths to install on our deck and used a staple gun to mount them.

It's exactly the amount of warmth that we were looking for."" — Frank Rizzo Get it from Amazon for $13.98+ (available in seven sizes and five colors). Backyard Expressions is a small biz! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bird bath. I’ve been wanting a bird bath for a long time, but the heavy concrete or metal ones are so expensive, and I am not strong enough to lug that thing home. This is made out of plastic, but it looks real. I mean, it looks like it’s made out of sturdy heavy metal. It’s not! I can lift it up with one hand. It’s so light. It comes with three stakes that you use to put in the ground to hold it in place, and it does not move. I highly recommend this bird bath. I am so pleased. The only downside is that I have not seen any birds in it yet. But every morning when I look out the window, all the water is gone. I have figured out that the deer are coming and drinking all the water in the middle of the night. Oh well, I am an animal-lover, so I guess I’m OK with that. Oh, and it comes with this cute little bird that attaches to the side of it. It’s just adorable. 😊 Buy it."" — BMR Get it from Amazon for $32 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""I bought this because I was looking for an effective insect repellent for my patio this spring/summer. I didn't want a bulky candle or tiki torch that smelled like canola oil. I found the Thermacell. It looked modern and promising. We tried it, and it works really well. It also produces no smell or sound. We live in the south, where mosquitoes are really awful, and the Thermacell made sitting on our patio tolerable ! Definitely recommend."" — Trusted Customer Get it from Amazon for $15.41+ (available in seven colors). Promising review: ""I love spending time outside, and we entertain on our patio, too. But when it's over 100 degrees outside, nobody feels like visiting. Until now!! I bought one and liked it so much I ordered another to cover both patios. They lower the temps to a more moderate level in just moments and don't use 100 gallons of water doing it! I put mine along the top of our privacy fence, and then put a fan behind it and made it almost like having an AC unit outside. They're easy to put up and take down and come with convenient hanging hooks! I read the reviews people wrote about the heads getting stopped up, and they WILL, but as a plumber, I'll tell you a trick to keeping them working like new: vinegar. Just remove the heads and soak them in a little straight vinegar, then use a small bristle brush like a toothbrush or nail brush, rinse them off, and replace them in the mister tubing, and they should be like brand-new."" — Sonya Combs Get it from Amazon for $19.82+ (available in several pack sizes). The mister will cool the surrounding area by 20 degrees, and it comes with an interchangeable flower-shaped misting head for a fun, whimsy detail. Promising review: ""Works exactly how I want it to. Provides a fine, cool mist on the patio, allowing us to enjoy the backyard until sunset without breaking a sweat. Easy to set up. It was out of the box and cooling us off within minutes."" — Debra L. Kusek Get it from Amazon for $24.98 . Promising review: ""Lovely colorful flower pots. Perfect size to hold a single flower, and they add such a nice pop of color to my yard. Very easy to hang up, no hardware required! I’m getting a lot of compliments on them. I bought several sets and planted bright flowers in them. I have them lining the inside of my yard and on the front of the house. They add a lot a cheer and homeyness for a simple and cheap project. "" — Maegan Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $18.59+ (available in multicolor, black, and white). Promising review: ""Our hot tub was so much grosser than I could have imagined. The amount of ick that this stuff got out of the jets was surprising. Honestly so embarrassing. I drained and cleaned the tub a few months ago but did not think of getting this jet cleaner. I will not make that mistake again. The hot tub smells so so clean now. I will definitely use this again next time I drain the tub."" — Kaerlia Get it from Amazon for $18.36 . Promising review: ""This windmill got a workout the first day when a storm came through with high winds. It’s so pretty in my yard and spinning away!"" — Judy Durham Lumpkin Get it from Amazon for $42.99+ (available in six colors). Promising review: ""This has become one of my kiddos' favorite summer outdoor play. The table with shade is easy to assemble, and the chair is ready to use with a simple, safe lock. True kiddos' furniture, the size is really up to 6 years old, depending on the little kids' size. Quality is decent for the age group, love the bright color, very lightweight for kiddos' use (due to that, do suggest putting it in a more closed space during windy days). Just like a toy set, but kids can really use and enjoy the summer outdoor weather, comfy to sit, and wipe clean."" — Meowcoolcat Get it from Amazon for $49.99 (available in four colors).

Read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""I am 60, and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption, and circulation."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""I have always had serious dark circles and bags under my eyes, and this has really changed this for me. The results are incredible. The puffiness is gone. The dark circles are hardly noticeable. My sensitive skin has not broken out. I never write reviews, but this was so good that I had to write a review. This actually works."" — Ben Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""Out of the hundreds of products I've bought, I've written maybe five reviews. Most of those were bad reviews. 😅 THIS review is like the 10 gold stars of reviews. I LOVE THIS EYE CREAM! I have a pretty nasty bag under only one of my eyes. Within four days, that bag is GONE! I don't know how, but it is. The area around my eyes is softer than it's ever been. Even makeup looks amazing now. It no longer settles in those pesky fine lines. I wish I could find a cream that made my entire face this soft. I microneedle, I've done TCA peels, I'm obsessed with Korean skincare, but NOTHING has ever given me such results as this eye cream. The area around my eyes feels like silk. BUY THIS EYE CREAM! You won't be disappointed."" — Emily Hunter Get it from Amazon for $14.44 . Promising review: ""My skin dries out severely during the winter, and I have to constantly use Vaseline to keep it moisturized (normal cream doesn't work on me). Imagine my surprise when my SO tried to put snail goo on me. Eww!! I resisted for weeks refusing to use this product as she constantly vouched for its abilities. After a month, I finally gave in, and boy, it was amazing! My hands feel more moisturized than ever for longer, and it doesn't leave a disgusting, greasy feel like Vaseline. Take it from a once-nonbeliever: You have to try this. Even if it doesn't work for you, you paid a fraction of what you would've paid for any other name-brand moisturizers ."" — Kyoko Ozaki Get it from Amazon for $16.98 . Promising review: ""So I initially started using another kojic acid soap to help with my hyperpigmentation due to shaving my face because I have PCOS and have developed hirsutism.

I have used almost every dry shampoo product on the market, and this is by far the best one yet . My hair looks beautiful, and I can now go nearly a week without washing (while still having absolutely gorgeous hair)! I used to have to wash my hair every other day when I was using my former favorite dry shampoo (and it made my scalp itch on day two).

Most amazing hair treatment I’ve ever used in my entire life. Most hair masks weigh my hair down, but since this is water, it makes it SO soft and bouncy. I’m obsessed and will keep buying. Holy grail. "" — Natasha Get it from Amazon for $10.97 . Promising review: ""I bought this on a whim when I saw someone review it on TikTok. After using it several times over the course of a week, I immediately noticed the difference in the color of my teeth. I'm a smoker and a heavy coffee drinker. I'm finding that this product will be a lifesaver in terms of what my smile looks like. I would definitely recommend!!"" — Mully Get a two-pack from Amazon for $15.95 . The kit includes eight Zombie Pack sets (powder and activator), plus one applicator brush! Promising review: ""When you put it on, the smell hits you hard.

Plus fun to take pictures looking like a cracked mess."" — raine Get an eight-pack from Amazon for $19.10 . Promising review: ""I bought this after discovering that my ingrown leg hairs weren't actually ingrown hairs, but KP. This product was very well reviewed and although I avoid gritty scrubs because of my sensitive skin, I thought I'd give it a try. Wow.

So happy to have beach-ready legs!"" — Ghanimatrix Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in three scents and two sizes). Promising review: ""I had peeling, weak nails for years. Tried everything. I bought this in February. This size bottle lasted a bit more than a month with me religiously applying it two to three times a day. I was really seeing great improvement, so I bought another bottle in late March. By May, all the peeling had grown out and my nails were getting stronger every day. I then bought the big 4-ounce refill bottle because I never want to run out of it again! Cannot recommend this stuff enough!"" — Diana Get it from Amazon for $9.90+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""My nails were in bad shape before I started using this product. I had one nail that would constantly split on the side, but not anymore.

I had recently used a product in my hair that had so much alcohol in it that it wreaked havoc on my hair, leaving it pretty damaged.

I highly recommend it to anyone natural or with curly hair. "" — Therese-Claire Get it from Amazon for $7.50 . Promising review: ""This product helped clear my skin after I struggled with many other products. I was struggling with what I thought was milia on my forehead.

Promising review: ""This product is amazing! Truly a miracle product. I had an AWFUL keloid forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done, and it was getting bigger and more irritated by the day. Nothing was helping. I bought this and started using it, and in less than two weeks, my huge keloid was completely gone! I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn’t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week, but then, the second week, it started totally disappearing, so give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick!"" — Jordan Caprigno Get it from Amazon for $12.85 (also available in multipacks).

Promising review: ""I've used this specific brand for years now and have found them to be the best at reducing the size and redness of breakouts! Whenever I notice a zit popping up, I put one of these on right before bed, and it stays put all night, even when I toss and turn a lot. By morning, it's much less noticeable and practically nonexistent when I cover the zit with makeup . It's such a great practically zero-effort way to treat blemishes!"" — Ciera Velarde And check out BuzzFeed Shopping editor Amanda Davis 's full Mighty Patch review for more info! Get a pack of 36 from Amazon for $12.99 . Promising review: ""It had to be said. These things are disgusting, that's why you should buy them. Squeeze part of your nose skin. Do a bunch of little pustules come out? Yeah, if you put one of these puppies on at night, you wake up, and that is all trapped inside that weird film. I dunno how it works. It's probably sorcery."" — Jack Sawyer Get a seven-pack from Amazon for $9.98 . Promising review: ""After just about three weeks of use I’ve seen such a positive change in both the evenness of time and of the texture of my skin. Melasma and acne scarring have faded pretty dramatically — I don’t even bother putting on foundation when I do my makeup in the morning. The oil is so lightweight and doesn’t exacerbate my already oily complexion. "" — L T C Get it from Amazon for $11.12 . Read more about ketoconazole shampoo at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""This stuff is absolutely amazing. I was one step away from going to the dermatologist. I had severe dandruff that was so bad, I could shake my head and it would come off.

Perfect Image is an independent beauty brand that launched in 2007 as a way to get professional-strength chemical peels in the hands of consumers at an affordable price. Promising review: ""This stuff is absolutely incredible. In January of 2017 I finally decided to try an at-home peel in conjunction with retinoids. Take a look at the photos I posted and you'll see how happy I am with my progress (after photo on the right taken June 2017.) I've used this peel once a week and have had incredible results. Previously I did three rounds of Fraxel, which only resulted in severe pain, peeling, and grossness. Oh yes, and an empty savings account. For 30 bucks every few months I achieved better results than I got at a dermatologist's office. "" — Meredith Get it from Amazon for $19.95+ (available in three strengths). Promising review: "" I have tried many other lip products for my chronic chapped lips, and nothing has worked. Except for this stuff. This stuff is amazing! For the first time in months, my lips don't hurt and aren't bright red. I won't buy anything else!"" — Colleen H. Get it from Amazon for $10 (available in six flavors and also available in packs of three). This cream helps define your natural texture and works best on those with wavy, curly, or coily hair!! Promising review: ""I'm so grateful that I found this product. My hair is wavy and frizzy. Every once in a great while, my waves resemble curls, but the frizz is always there. I've only used this product once so far, and I never want to be without it. I put some on after towel-drying (no brushing) my hair, and my waves actually resembled curls! It wasn't instant so I was skeptical but after about 15 minutes, I caught a glimpse of my hair in the mirror, and I was amazed. It looked styled rather than a ratty mess. I slept on it, and it still looked great in the morning!!!"" — mich0610 Get it from Amazon for $8.47 . Promising review: ""I would use hairspray to hold my eyebrows and throughout the day I would sweat through it and it wouldn’t last. I tried this because the price was great and I’m gladI did. This product is awesome. I’ve had it on my brows for a nine-hour shift and they are still in place! It doesn’t dry and get flakey, nor does it feel uncomfortable on the skin. Lastly, I use brow powder and this does NOT affect the look of the powder nor does it smudge it. I will FOREVER buy this product."" — Shelby Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in five shades, including clear). Promising review: ""This is smooth, blends well with foundation, and feels good on the skin. Sets well with powder. I sometimes wear it alone for a little smoother look. Since it's colorless, it doesn't look like foundation. The price is great and I've yet to see it in a store. I like that I can control how much to apply, and a little goes a long way. It appears to wash off well. Will be buying it again."" — Momma Bee Get it from Amazon for $10 . Mad Rabbit was found by college friends Oliver Zak and Selom Agbitor after seeing a gap in the market for all-natural products to heal, protect and enhance tattoos. They pitched their tattoo salve in season 12 of Shark Tank. Promising review: ""Product was awesome. It rejuvenated a 5-year-old tattoo and made it look like new again. Mad Rabbit absorbed into the skin very easily without being greasy."" — Janson Ward Get it from Amazon for $13.04+ (available in two scents).

BuzzFeed Contributor Makup Beauty is a small business that specializes in makeup products. Promising reviews: ""I’ll never try anything else! I’ve been using this while on vacation and all day in the heat my eyebrows didn’t move. I even took a little dip in the pool and they still looked perfect."" — cherie noel ""It absolutely holds brows in place all day - even through sweating. It doesn’t flake or show up on dark brows - if you do see any, just run a clean spoolie through them and any visible product disappears completely. Getting a laminated effect is effortless. This stuff beats every single high-end brand I’ve tried over the years in my search for the perfect brow gel. The container lasts far longer, works much better, and costs at least half the price. Just get it."" — Allyson C Get it from Amazon for $9.98 . Promising review : ""There isn’t anything about this skirt that I did not like. I welcomed the simplicity of the style, and the fact that it was lined made it all the more appealing. Linen is one of my favorite fabrics, particularly come the summer months. The color, a beautiful shade of red, is most attractive. I have not worn it other than to try it on, so I don’t know how it holds up when laundered. Very pleased with this simple skirt, and especially for the price. Look forward to getting some wear out of it this spring and fall."" — Anonymous Get it from Nordstrom for $48.95 (originally $89; available in women's sizes 00–16). Promising review: ""No notes! These are the perfect summer shorts!"" — Erica Get it from Abercrombie for $50 (available in women's sizes XXS–XL and eight colors). Promising review: ""My favorite summer accessory! I can not recommend this neck fan enough! On hot days, it is a lifesaver and instantly cools you down. Everyone in my family used to fight over it, so now we all have one. Affordable price, easy to use and battery life is great!"" — Laura S. Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ (available in 14 colors). Promising reviews: ""The most comfortable pants I've ever worn. I don't even know why I would bother wearing anything else. Fits great, silky soft, lightweight, and breathable. Perfect summer pants when it's a tiny bit cool for shorts but too warm for yoga pants or jeans. Purple is just as vibrant as the pictures."" — tatianna ""Looooove these pants, I cannot wait to wear them! 😍 They're so cute and so comfy, I need them in every color. I am definitely going to wear these to my next yoga class."" — B Get them from Amazon for $19.95+ (available in sizes women's 16–24 and 35 colors). Promising reviews: "" This romper is so cute and comfortable. It was easy to wear and take off for bathroom breaks. The material is stretchy but holds its shape very well and is lightweight to keep you cool for spring and summer. I didn’t have any issue with snagging, and after washing and drying, wrinkles were minimal. I packed it for a trip, and it looked great in my suitcase without needing to be ironed or hung. I am definitely going to buy more in other colors."" — Kimberly ""I purchased this jumpsuit to wear out as an easy plus-sized outfit for summer. I loved it so much that I purchased two more in different colors, and I transitioned them to fall weather with a long duster sweater.""— Keisha W. Get it from Amazon for $30.59 (available in women's sizes S–3XL and 32 colors). Promising reviews: "" I am a makeup artist. This mascara outperforms nearly every other mascara I have used. I am 55 and have purchased and used numerous drugstore and specialty mascaras. All the high-priced ones are SUPPOSED to do what this very quiet, marketed, very black mascara does: coats every lash, thickens, and lengthens every time, and for this price?!?! Sssshhh, don't tell anyone, lol."" — Laura Price ""I've been using this mascara for the last four years and I absolutely love it. I've ventured out a few times to try other brands but I keep coming back to this one. It goes on smooth, no clumping, stays all day with very little smudging. I use the regular black that is NOT waterproof. Even in the summer during the heat it stays put. I highly recommend this."" — KJ Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in two colors and a three-pack). And check out our full Essence Lash Princess Mascara review for more details. Promising review: ""Love this top! I live in sunny and hot Northern California and need cool tops that are stylish and comfortable, too. Also, I'm in my '60s and don't care to look too sexy with a low-cut top. This is adjustable in the straps, and I was able to adjust the front to a place that feels appropriate. I'm going to buy more colors as this will be one of my summer staples!"" — kelbrew1 Get it from Amazon for $17.46+ (available in sizes XS–XXL and 18 colors). Promising review: ""Wonderful color and material. Very pretty and comfortable. Great for hot weather, for sure. I love wearing dresses in the summer, and this one is so cute!"" — Perfect Throw Get it from Target for $15 (available in sizes XS–4X and four colors). Promising review: ""I never write reviews, but after using this ,I had to come back and give a review. I saw this as an Instagram ad and was skeptical. Living in a very humid state, I was at the point of giving up trying to have nice hair during the summer. I saw this ad a couple of times then finally bought it. All I can say is that I wish I didn’t wait so long! I have blonde, very thin, fine hair and always struggle with products weighing down my hair/ making it look dirty, this doesn’t do that at all. My hair blow dries beautifully, it gives a nice shine and leaves my hair so soft. It’s a world of difference between using it and not. On extremely bad days, I do still get some frizz, but nothing like before. Worth every penny!!"" — Michelle Get it from Amazon for $28 . This will also come in handy when and if you have to start commuting! Promising reviews: ""Absolutely one of the best purchases I have made. I live in Orlando where the humidity and heat get unbearable and this has really saved me recently. Perfect and compact for the theme parks and the battery life has been AMAZING so far, only have had to charge once in the past month. Do not hesitate and purchase this!"" — WindPretear ""This device is literally life-changing. I went on a month-long trip to Australia, Fiji, American Samoa, New Caledonia, Kauai, and Oahu, and this saved me so many times from ruining my makeup from sweating or just keeping myself cool in general. It was nice when the car was warming up before the AC kicked in to turn this on, so I didn’t feel like I was gonna pass out the back of the car. When I went on a hike, I used it and I feel like I got less tired. I’m telling you this thing is amazing."" — Taylor Osgood Get it from Amazon for $15.29+ (available in six colors). Promising review: "" Best wipes out there. Definitely freshens, I use on underarms and underboob. I couple it with Dove's Advanced Dry Cool Cucumber and the two keep me fresh on my very long days. The seal works great. I read to always store wipes upside down to maintain the moisture on the wipes for the next use. I really was skeptical, but now I make sure I have them even in my travel bag. "" — Nile ""These wipes smell amazing and are very handy! I store them several places for easy access! They are a staple in the summer to keep the sweat at bay!"" — Jeanie Riggs Get it from Amazon for $29.98 for a pack of two. Promising review: ""Beautifully sewn. The material is soft and light enough for summer. I bought more after I tried them on. I think I bought six. Great price. You will be delighted with these dresses. You can add a jacket to dress it up."" — Sally Get it from Walmart for $13.36+ (originally $32.99; available in sizes M–3XL and 12 colors). Promising reviews: ""I bought these for wearing more in the summer as I get overheated easily and therefore sweat a lot (hormones!). These work great, and I can wear them several days at a time without any smell! They also are comfortable and fit well. They wash and dry well so far too."" — Kate Fox ""I wanted something to transition into fall to wear under cardigans and flannels. They look super cute front-tucked and are very soft."" — Barbara Get them from Amazon for $18.60+ (available in sizes XS–6X and in 17 color combos). Promising review: ""This long short is so in right now! Perfect summer shorts for a stylish 90s look that you can’t go wrong with."" — Gloria Get it from Abercrombie & Fitch for $42 (originally $70, available in sizes 23–37 and six washes). Promising review: ""I love everything about this hat. I live in a coastal community. This hat gets A Lot of wear. Keeps the sun off my head and face and is also good for drizzly days. Bad hair days (which is often in this hot, humid environment) are easily disguised with this stylish hat. I like the tabs that adjust it to fit. It doesn’t come off even in the boat! I have traveled extensively with this hat, and it really does keep its shape no matter how much or how long I squish it. I have had 3 friends order after they saw mine! This photos is after 3 weeks of travel with it either being stuffed in a carryon so full it barely zipped or in my backpack."" — A. DD Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in 21 colors). Promising reviews: ""Great summer tank top!! It is double-lined, so it's not see-through!! I don’t feel the need to put a bra on with this tank top, which in my opinion is so hard to find a tank top like this! 10/10 will be buying different colors for the summer."" — Macy Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in sizes S–XXL and 32 colors). Promising reviews: ""After you get used to a liquid eyeliner, you’ll never go back. I don’t like how pencil eyeliners tug at your eyes. This does not. It lasts all day and is easily removed with makeup remover. Coverage is great and stays put. Great for these hot humid summers here in TN!"" — Kimberley Franklin ""At first I was skeptical as to why this eyeliner is 'so great,' but then one day, I decided to cry three times with this product on my eyes...let me just say, IT DID NOT BUDGE!! I have tried other felt-tip eyeliners, and they were really similar to this product, but this one has the absolute BEST staying power. For real. You will not regret buying this!"" — Jay Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in 14 colors). And read our full review of the Stila Stay All Day liquid eyeliner here . Promising review: ""I was looking for something cool to wear the hot summer. This is IT! I have gotten compliments on this and liked it so much that I ordered a second one in brown. I can imagine wearing these all summer long and into the early fall. Easy to dress down or dress up for a cute boho look."" — A. Gjeny Get it from Amazon for $27.99 (available in women's sizes S–3XL and in 12 colors and patterns). Promising reviews: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months."" — Meg B. ""I absolutely LOVE this stuff. I can't recall how I found out about it, but with long hair in Texas humidity, Monday is a game changer. I went two weeks w/out washing my hair as I was on sponge bath restrictions and my hair never looked greasy. I would only warn that after two weeks, your hair will get dry to the touch, so wash it ASASP. I usually just use it to get me out of a week since I wear baseball caps to cover my face. No more skin cancer on this face! :) The hats and SPF allow me to put my hair in a cute ponytail or bun."" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $6.97 . Promising reviews: ""This dress is so so comfortable! The fabric quality is great - built in bra is a game changer, the dress is comfortable and supportive enough to go braless!"" — Bijou Williams ""The material is buttery soft, has built in shorts to eliminate my thighs rubbing together and provides just enough tummy control. Will be living in this dress this summer and definitely buying more colors!"" — Amanda Bertelli Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in sizes XS – XXL and in eight colors). Promising review: ""I had a makeup artist recommend this finishing spray and it didn’t disappoint! I work at a school with am/pm outside duty! In Texas heat my makeup stays all day!"" — Shelly Deane Warren Get it from Amazon for $16 . Promising review: “AMAZING. I didn’t know what I was missing! As someone who is ALWAYS sweaty, this was an absolute lifesaver for the wedding I was just in that was outside and almost 85F blazing sun for photos. Once I put this on it was game over, no sweatiness for the whole night, including pits, cleavage, underbust, etc. The other ladies were so excited to have a solution since our dresses were light blue. FYI this does come out like baby powder, best to disrobe and apply rather than trying to sneak it in underneath clothing if you are able. 10000000% will buy again and always have on hand!"" — 01 Get it from Amazon for $15.97 . Promising reviews: ""The BEST sunscreen I have ever used! I am always prone to burn any time I get out in the sun . I decided to take a trip to the beach this summer, and just went kayaking for four hours on the water in the BEAMING sun and in the MIDDLE OF THE DAY . I put sunscreen everywhere except for my chest. Wanna know where my skin is resembling that of a cherry? My chest. The rest of me? TANNING WITH NO BURN WHATSOEVER!!! I was shocked. I love this product and will forever recommend it for the rest of my life. Stay safe and stay unaffected from the sun you guys!!!"" — Channing C. ""I love this sunscreen, it’s perfect and doesn’t leave a white cast."" — KT97 Get it from Amazon for $9.60 . Promising reviews: "" During these humid summer days I had to reorder an old favorite. This stuff is light and reliable. I have fine hair that does what it wants on humid days. This product keeps my mane tame and soft."" — Tammy Leonel ""I've struggled with frizzy hair for years, but this has been a game changer for me. A few drops of this lightweight serum applied to damp hair before styling tames frizz instantly, leaving my hair smooth, shiny, and incredibly manageable. The argan oil infusion adds a touch of nourishment and helps to prevent future frizz. I'm so happy I finally found a product that actually works to control my unruly hair!"" — Kleo Get it from Amazon for $6.97 (also available in larger sizes and multipacks).

Believe it or not, as a homeowner, you might be excited about non-slip felt pads. BuzzFeed Staff It features realtime two-way audio, color night vision, and a 360-degree rotating 1080p camera. Promising review : ""Having cameras inside the house is nice for checking on the dogs. Having a feeder where you can watch your dogs eat is better. Having a camera that can swivel to check where your dogs went and feed them? Perfect. The setup was easy, and I was up and running in no time. I have no regrets making this purchase, and I’ve gotten my dogs used to the new camera, and they definitely enjoy all the treats being dispensed. It’s also nice to be able to talk to the pups and stop them from doing stuff through the mic. Highly recommend for people who aren’t at home a lot and worry about their pets and just want to give them some loving while you’re busy."" — Eugene Get it from Amazon for $65 . This robotic vacuum can easily move between hard floors and low- to medium-pile carpets/rugs and can pick up all the accumulated dust, dirt, and hair while you go about your day. It has an infrared sensor to avoid knocking into obstacles (like furniture and walls) and drop-sensing tech so it won't fall down stairs and off ledges. And if it starts to run low on battery, it'll just return to its base for a recharge! Reviewers do recommend keeping stray items like socks and cords off the floor before running this. Promising review: ""This robot vacuum is incredible! I have three dogs and a cat; this vacuum is a time saver. I run it each day, and it has done an incredible job of keeping pet hair, dirt, and debris picked up in my home. Works well on carpet, hardwood, and tile floors. Wish I had purchased it sooner!"" — t. hampton Get it from Amazon for $159.99+ (also available in two models). Promising review: ""I cook outside, and lighting a fire during wet and windy weather was a real pain. This lighter was a game changer! As long as the material is dry, this lighter will light regularly, consistently, and easily. Plus, it’s rechargeable! Love it!"" — Sandra Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in eight colors and as a two-pack). Promising review: ""This works absolutely phenomenal. I would clean the bowl area every weekend like clock work to remove mold or something…Our municipal water system may not inject enough chlorine to prohibit? But toilet cleaning is a breeze now!!! Works on the Koehler new low flush systems…amazing. No chlorine damage to rubber parts either like other devices! Pretty simple instructions to install."" — CdrW Get it from Amazon for $10.77+ (and you can snag refill cartridges here ). Promising reviews: ""The ChomChom Roller really works. I have two German Shepherds who shed SO much, so this was necessary. The ChomChom Roller picked up SO much fur the vacuum couldn’t."" — Ezra Gordon ""I've had it in my possession for like two hours and I've cleaned everything. The couch, the blinds, the cat tree pad, the chair; I'm obsessed. I feel like this thing should win an award for being so awesome. I feel like it should be in raffle baskets and giveaways and silent auctions for every event that highlights 'things cat people need.' It's better than those sticky rollers, it's better than the one-directional velvet wand thing that I always use the wrong way. It's the best."" — Meowser Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Reviewers love this because it doesn't require you to ""smart enable"" other parts of your home. I need to get one of these for my husband who drags himself out of bed every morning to turn on his espresso machine. Promising review: ""This is exactly what I was looking for and had no idea it existed until I saw someone mention it on TikTok! Our front walkway gets pretty dark at night, and I was frustrated with trying to remember to turn on the light every evening and off every morning. I looked into those light sensors you can plug in, but our front porch light is under an awning with enough shade that it would have kept the light on 24/7. This little Switchbot solved the problem . I applied it to the indoor light switch and set the time on my phone. It has worked perfectly ever since."" — Alecia McLochlin Get it from Amazon for $29 (available in white and black). I have this machine in evergreen, and it flawlessly matches my kitchen — which absolutely sparks joy. I was admittedly a little confused at first on how to use it (surprisingly), but once I figured it out, it was smooth sailing. Since it's a single-serve machine, you'll need to add your pod, close the hatch, pour the exact amount of water you'd like to be dispensed in the top, then click the button once , and wait for the water to heat and pour out. Don't hit the button over and over like I thought I had to...oops. Anyways, it's a fabulous lil' machine and looks super cute on my counter! Promising review: ""I love the convenience of this machine, and the color makes me so happy! Such an attractive design that doesn’t take up too much space on my counter. It even matches my favorite coffee mug!"" — Jen F. Get it from Amazon for $84.49+ (available in five colors). My husband, a coffee connoisseur, has assured me in the ""coffee community"" this machine is regarded as one (if not THE) best drip coffee machines on the market. I mean, it does boast the ability to brew between a half or full carafe, a brew basket that automatically stops the flow of coffee when removing the carafe (no mess!), and a hotplate with an independent heating element to keep coffee at the *perfect* temperature. But for me? It's the color options. There are SO many to choose from — there's no doubt in my mind anyone would be able to find an option that would look great in their home. I actually *do* own one in my home (it's fabulous) and it does all that it says it will. It's certainly lived up to our expectations — and we drink a lot of coffee as parents of a one-year-old. Get it from Amazon for $359 (available in 25 colors). Promising review: ""I love this item! I saw it originally on TikTok and thought it would be perfect for our bathroom! We have one bathroom upstairs and five people who use it. This cleared up so much counter space for us! There are ventilation holes where the cups go to help make sure they dry properly. The toothpaste dispenser has really been working to get every last drop out of the tube. Would definitely recommend for a family or kids bathroom. There is also a little storage compartment behind the toothpaste that is great for extra brushes, cotton swabs, or flossers. "" — Sariyah J Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in four colors). My husband found this online and was absolutely blown away by the technology. This tool connects to an app on your phone, allowing you to problem solve without having to spend an exorbitant amount of money. He used it multiple times throughout our first year as homeowners to look into heat ducts, down drains, inside walls, etc. Promising review: "" This camera works so well it’s almost a joke. An overhead light in my boat’s cabin had severed wire. The hole to access the wire is not even 1/2” in diameter, and the gap in the ceiling is only 2” tall. Adjusted the semi rigid cable, located the severed wire, went back in with the hook attached, and voila!"" — the family cook Get it from Amazon for $26.99+ . Promising review: ""Works perfectly for scrubbing the stuck lint out of the insides of your dryer. Everyone who owns a dryer should have these, they're basic safety equipment. Clean that lint, and reduce the fire hazard and make the machine more efficient . They're long enough, strong enough, and just flexible enough without being too flexible."" — Winged Wolf Get two from Amazon for $6.99+ . My husband and I bought our first home four years ago and it has been quite the learning experience. Luckily my father-in-law has a plethora of tools, such as this vacuum, that made most of our DIYs a breeze. After ripping up a carpet and removing all the staples that had been holding it down, I was amazed we were able to use this machine to clean all the debris up in one swipe. Promising review: ""I had a 40-year-old Craftsman shop vacuum that finally broke, I was not expecting a modern one to perform as well as the old one however this new one is better in every way. The hose holds its shape under the vacuum, the wheels turn easily allowing it to move freely. It’s so much quieter than the old model, I like the cart especially as it gives a handle to allow you to move the vacuum around without bending down which for someone with low back pain, this is a great relief"" — Silver Get it from Amazon for $139.99+ (available in three sizes and four different accessories). You can cut these for a perfect fit, so no worries about the exact sizing. It's also machine washable, so any crumbs or stains can be easily removed. Promising review: ""I have recently moved into an apartment with some pretty gross cupboards, drawers, and kitchen shelves that I can do almost nothing about. I didn't want to put down adhesive shelf liner and traditional mesh type cushioning shelf liner doesn't really protect my dishes from touching the ancient stained wood. This stuff is a great solution for me. It's a nice thick padding that's textured on the bottom so it doesn't slide around. The top is slick and smooth and easy to clean. I don't really bother to trim this stuff, instead I place it in the cupboard and let the excess bend up around the edges creating a little bumper around the edge of the cabinet. Makes me feel so much better about my kitchen and the bright white look says 'clean' in a place that desperately needs something to say 'clean.' I've used a couple different types of this style of liner in this kitchen and this brand is by far my favorite. Go ahead and buy the larger rolls. Ten feet seems like a lot of material until you're filling cupboards and drawers you'll use more than you think."" — Taylor Whitney Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""Just got a new house with all new wood floors. Every piece of furniture needed felt 'feet.' I found this package on Amazon and hoped it would do the trick for all of my furniture. When I received it (quickly no less) I thought it was too small of a package to get the job done, but once I started with the dining room table and six chairs I realized there was plenty in the package to add a dot to every bit of furniture I needed to 'shoe.' It was easy to adhere and now everything scoots like a dream."" — Robyn Restel Get a box of 181 pads from Amazon for $13.99 . BambooMN is a small business! BuzzFeeder Jennifer Tonti credits this burner cover for helping her cook with ease: ""OK so I bought this for my own tiny apartment (pictured above) and OMG you guys. Life = changed. Food = chopped. Counter space = doubled. I mean the math is all there."" Promising review: ""This is so perfect for extra space. It covers the top of my apartment-sized stove so I can then use my stove space for my Instant Pot and food prep. The best space-saving and cosmetic thing I have ever gotten for this tiny apartment. "" — Talyn Amber Skye Get it from Amazon for $29.95+ . Promising review: ""I have three sets of these and use them at home and at my cabin in the Rockies. They work great and power through walls. I use one to turn on and off a painting light that otherwise could only be turned on by climbing onto the fireplace and carefully reaching up and behind the painting to turn on. Why get up and stumble around to turn on a light?"" — Lee Get it from Amazon for $34.23 . I have this can opener and bought it for my parents when their old electric one died. It may not seem like the most essential purchase but when you've watched your dad try to open a can of tuna with a butcher knife, you'll realize it's best to have one on hand. Promising review: ""This is a top-notch can opener. Gone through several other cheap brands that have broken and left me nearly cutting a finger off trying to finish opening the half mutilated can, but this guy knows how to get the job done and the handle is much more ergonomic in my opinion. Do yourself a favor and buy five, one for yourself and four for people in your life because this guy will change their life."" — AK Get it from Amazon for $13.89 . Promising review : ""While a bit spendy, these blinds are great! The customer service is impeccable, and they are very responsive and were able to work with my poor measuring skills to get me sorted with a new set that only required a motor swap! After doing it twice because I put the reset button the wrong way, I'm back installed, and they work great!!!! Thank you!!"" — Johnny X. Get them from Amazon for $153.99+ (available in 14 colors; all orders are custom sized). Neither my husband nor I have ever had a garage, but this is a new worry that seems to plague us now that we DO have one. He immediately ordered this in an attempt to qualm his fears about forgetting to close the garage, which is filled with pretty much everything we own right now. We even drove 20 minutes away recently only to turn around to ensure the garage was, in fact, closed. Don't be like us. Order this product. Promising review: ""Bought this for my parents — my dad always forgets to close the garage when he leaves and it makes my mom feel unsafe. I installed it and got the app working on all three of our phones in under 20 minutes even with not-great Wi-Fi in the garage. Set up a schedule to automatically try to close the door every hour if it's open. It gives my mom peace of mind that she can check and see the garage is closed from anywhere. Overall: easy to install, working great, and I would definitely recommend this product."" — LG Get it from Amazon for $27.79 . FitFabHome is a small business! Promising review: ""These liners are life-changing! I never thought I needed them until a friend raved about them. Clean up is so simple, no more melted cheese or sauces burnt to the bottom of my ovens. I love that I can cut them down to size to fit my toaster oven. My husband enjoys grilling with the liners now, he doesn't have to line the grill with aluminum foil which he found so annoying, deterring him to grill. This product really has simplified my life in the kitchen and I love it."" — Kindle Custommer Get a pack of three from Amazon for $12.99 . Promising review: ""Got an outdoor can, the kind the mechanical arm on the garbage truck picks up and tips over, with the lid opening by gravity. Placed this on the inside of the lid, near the hinge to lessen the chances of it being scraped off during emptying and no flies/maggots! No apparent odor, just seems to put a big hurt on the fly party that used to be my trash can (litter box contents, remnants of meat, etc.) "" — Michael E. Bradley Get it from Amazon for $9.84 . I own and cherish this product. It's a dream knowing the ""brush"" is fresh and hasn't been intimate with the inside of my toilet prior to my picking it up again. This set comes with the wand and 16 refills. Promising review: ""The primary reason I decided to purchase the Clorox Toilet Wand was so I could clean under my toilet rims, which I noticed was definitely getting neglected via using the standard toilet brushes to clean. Initially, I was looking for a toilet brush that had the shape needed to actually GET under the rim, and that's how I found out about it. Now that I've used it... I can say without a doubt that'll I'll never go back to a regular brush. I like the cleanliness of the disposable brushes as opposed to a regular toilet brush. And I especially like that I don't have to purchase a second brush with a shape capable of cleaning under the rim, which not only takes up more space, but also would take more time given I'd have to switch back and forth and apply product. With this, I can just clean the entire pot in less than five minutes with the same tool."" — Brittney Nelson Get it from Amazon for $20.85 . I have this cutting board, and I really love it. The lovely color is an added bonus (I have it in taffy, which is a muted purple), but the real standout feature is the grips on each corner of the board. It doesn't slip at all and cleans easily, definitely a must-have in our home where we're constantly cutting up a variety of things for our toddler. Material Kitchen is an Asian-owned small business that sells lovely kitchen products — they were even featured on Oprah's Favorite Things 2021! Additionally, 50% of profits from the colors ""To Pó-Po with Love"" and ""Reimagine Justice"" go to Heart of Dinner and Drive Change . Promising review: ""This cutting board is excellent. The grippy feature prevents it from sliding around on a granite countertop. It washes easily and dries with one swipe of a towel. Good size and good weight. I did a lot of research before buying this, and I’m pleased with my choice. The non-slip grips sealed the deal — great feature."" — Cindy C. Get it from Material Kitchen for $40 (available in four colors). Each cord is six feet long and has three available plugs. Additionally, Collections Etc is a small business. Promising review: ""I have no idea why these are not sold everywhere. PERFECT for my room! I ended up getting this due to my king size bed being against a wall with only one outlet. I needed a way to connect my two lamps on my nightstand and this is absolutely, without a doubt, the very best solution to connecting my lamps and also not having all my outlets taken up. I recommend this to everyone! Also perfect for outlets connected to a switch to turn on and off both lights at the same time."" — Ryan Get it from Amazon for $14.84 (available in two colors). My parents have one specifically for my mom to dye her hair (sorry for, uh, publicizing that, Mom) in so she doesn't stain their nice, new sinks. I'm planning to get one for my laundry room to soak stained clothing and whatnot before tossing it into the washing machine. Promising review: ""I purchased this as a replacement for an old but nearly exact sink that is the only sink in my garage/auto shop. This is plenty sturdy for filling pails and cleaning heavy parts. As noted by others, the faucet is especially nice. Along with the faucet, this unit would be ideal for washing dogs up to a medium size. An excellent piece for not much money. As is usual with Amazon, it was delivered in just two days."" — D OC Get it from Amazon for $209.99+ (available in two styles). Promising review : ""I purchased these to cover the side of my house. Installation was easy and I left them outside for two days to charge. The light coverage was about what I expected from them and do the job well. The motion sensitivity covers all the side and lights turn on. It has rained about three times and still work great and hoping they last for a long time."" — J. Argueta Get a set of four from Amazon for $33.99 . Promising review : ""This Rubbermaid scrubber is fantastic. It cleans around the kitchen sink easily, scrubs those pot scrapes off porcelain sinks with ease. It also cleans in the bathroom, scrubs the tile in the shower, cleans walls at the sink area and so much more. I don't know how I cleaned without it. It is wonderful! Don't hesitate, buy it!"" — lindae Get it from Amazon for $9.98 . To learn why my BuzzFeed Shopping colleague loves this, check out our full Rubbermaid Power Scrubber review . There is NOTHING more irritating than gnats or any other tiny insects invading your home. I have these Sticky Stakes in every potted plant I own and they actually really work! Each pack comes with seven traps, so feel free to stock up. Promising review: ""Just placed another order for more. I was given a plant that has brought in lots of gnats. I didn’t realize how many there were till I got this. They are doing a great job of catching/killing these annoying bugs. I even was able to put the sticky side in on the lower clip so that it wouldn’t stick to the leaves of the plant and rip them. Will definitely continue to get these when needed. Hopefully they will get rid of all of them soon."" — Nicole Pisa Get them from Amazon for $8.97 . Promising review : ""I have an old shower/bathtub. I tried name brand shower cleaners and bleach to try and clean the soap scum off the tiles and tub. I had no luck and I would cough and get sick because of how strong the smell was. I thought I would try this to save my lungs. I sprayed my entire shower and left it for about 15 minutes. I came back and rinsed off the walls and they were shiny! I've never had such a clean shower. The smell is amazing and subtle. All I smell is tea tree and it didn't affect me at all. The price is also a good deal since the bottle is pretty large. It came with the sprayer separate and the bottle sealed so it wouldn't leak in the box. I highly recommend this."" — Amber Erwin Get a pack of two from Amazon for $15.99 . I bought this for myself and OMG. This thing REALLY works. Usually when my husband makes sauce from scratch I'm left with chunks of tomatoes throughout my sink and water that WILL NOT drain — that was until I bought the SinkShroom (which comes from a small business!). My mom was so impressed she bought one, too. It's a serious game-changer. Promising review: ""I’ve been a fan of the SinkShroom and TubShroom , and this is the best product from the line so far. My kitchen sinks simply do not clog any more, so there’s no more reaching into a bunch of water to unclog anything with my hand."" — Brady Amerson Get it from Amazon for $10.42 . Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. Grampa's Weeder is a small business! Promising review: ""Oh my god, I friggin' love this tool. I bought this on a whim given we bought our first house and know nothing about caring for a yard. Boy, has it come in handy. Our new house had a ton of weeds in the front yard, and this tool helped me get most of them out in no time. In fact, the process of yanking out the weed was strangely satisfying! I don't think anyone can say that weeding is fun, but this tool made it as close to fun as you can get , especially when you see a long root along with the weed you pulled."" — JG Get it on Amazon for $39.97 . Tushy is a small business! Promising review: ""I bought this because I was very curious. I was initially worried the cold water would be an issue but so far it is not. I am worried about the winter months though as I think the tap water may be a little cooler. This thing cleans up your butt like you just got out of shower. I wish these were in every public toilet everywhere. I won't poop anywhere in my house except the master bath now. I am excited to poop so I can flush it and then clean up using the Tushy so I can see in the toilet how much it cleaned my butt. You will be amazed."" — Ryan Get it from Amazon for $99 . This plant-based cleaner will remove streaks, smudges, and fingerprints from all stainless steel surfaces — sounds very therapeutic to me! Additionally, Therapy is a small business. Promising review: ""THIS Therapy Premium Stainless Steel Cleaner is AMAZING. New dishwasher and and a hungry dog are NOT compatible! Our small dog, 12 pounds, had a habit of stretching up her front paws and scratching her nails on the dishwasher while her food was prepared. Not even days had gone by and the new dishwasher had little thin claw scratches all down the front. I had stopped her by placing a footstool to block her, but other family members had not, despite my instructions. I tried several cleaners and had resigned to having a scratched appliance. But ONE try with the Therapy cleaner — yes, a *miracle*. The scratches cannot be seen at all — polished right out of sight. The dishwasher looks even better than when fresh out of the box — it is gleaming. I eagerly shared the success with my kitchen remodeler, who installs many appliances, and I hope others can restore their stainless products. Try it!"" — L. Peterson Get it from Amazon for $19.95 . My Critter Catcher is a small business! Promising review: ""This thing is awesome! Initially I was hesitant that it would squish the little guys or they would fall out in transport but it's great! Highly recommend! Sorry little guy your GPS brought you into my house, I will help you find your way back outside :)"" — Crystal R Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (available in three colors). You can use this product on both front-load and top-load washing machines. There's also a version you can use to clean your dishwasher ! Promising review: ""My washing machine instructions said to buy this product specifically to clean out the washer. It definitely helped with odor and the washer seems to be working more efficiently now. Great price, would buy again."" — Fred Get it from Amazon for $11.98 . Promising review: ""I'm loving this little brush. I had purchased another dish brush a while back from the grocery store and the bristles were so stiff that it often splattered soap everywhere. This one isn't like that. The bristles are stiff, but soft enough that they tend to cling to what you're brushing, so they don't cause that splatter effect. I also like that you can open the whole thing up by taking its top off to refill it, giving you plenty of room to pour in the dish soap. The ability to easily remove and replace the brush is another very handy feature. Both are easy to do and it's well made, so they're not likely to come open or undone unexpectedly."" — Elliria Get it from Amazon for $8.99 . Promising review: ""These things are awesome! I cleaned my bathroom tile grout first because the lady that lived there before me really let it go. A few places stayed stained and I was worried it wouldn't cover them, but all grout areas are bright white and look new now!"" — Donna K Cook Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (available in narrow and wide tips). Promising review: ""This product is great, in my opinion. Installing it wasn’t too bad. Though make sure you have the right measurement tools, and you’re doing the measurements with another person. It makes time go by way quicker. What I also love about this product is that my garage looks way less cluttered. We don’t have bikes to hang, but we just have a lot of decorations that need to be stored away and it just makes our lives way easier. We also store my husband's tools on top of it. I was skeptical about the weight capacity, and it proved me wrong."" — HelloKiwii Get it from Amazon for $137.99+ (available in three colors).

They hold up great, mop up crumbs and spills quickly, can be popped in the dishwasher to clean, and bring a bit of color to the sink area in my otherwise neutral kitchen."" — Wynnefred Get a set of five from Amazon for $14.95 (available in 15 very pretty sets). I bought this after being peer-pressured by all the lovely reviews and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype. The scent is lovely — it has depth with a hint of floral, but it's light and not at all overpowering . My favorite thing about it is how easily it pairs with other scents, because I am a body mist gremlin who swaps out her scents every day. The lather is also deeply satisfying, and I feel quite refreshed and squeaky clean without ever feeling dry. Promising review: ""Cremo's body wash is nothing short of exceptional. If you’re a fan of luxurious fragrances, this product will quickly become your new favorite. It boasts an incredible scent that perfectly mimics Baccarat Rouge 540 — a fragrance renowned for its sophisticated and captivating aroma.

The gold details on the sides are such a stunning touch — reminiscent of high-end Miu Miu sunglasses but at a fraction of the cost . They’re lightweight, comfortable, and feel durable. I’ve received so many compliments already. Highly recommend these for anyone looking to add a chic accessory to their collection!"" — Arsalan sheikh Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in five styles and two packs). Promising review: ""I first saw this book on TikTok and decided to look more into it. I purchased four total because I know some people holding onto things that are difficult to let go of. It’s a great way to look at things from a different perspective and truly hold yourself accountable to different things in your life. I love what it stands for, and I look forward to when I burn mine after I’m done. Self-love, self-care, and meditation for a better state of mind tomorrow are always the goal. I definitely recommend it to those susceptible to change and the willingness to try things differently ."" — Brent Helm Get it from Amazon for $7.70 .

I feel like these are ideal for people who still want to hear some of the world around them (read: parents, people working in open offices), but still want to listen to their tunes comfortably . The charge on these goes for at least four hours (I haven't tried it beyond that yet), and the Bluetooth connects to my devices super easily. Excellent pair of headphones for the price point. Promising review : ""These headphones surprised me. I thought they were not going to be as great because of how cheap they are, but the bass is amazing!

Comes with three sizes in the box, each in a different pattern."" — R&M Get a pack of 30 from Amazon for $3.77 . Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin . It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" — KimT Get it from Amazon for $5.48 . I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can’t be beat, so I’m buying more."" — HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!). Promising reviews: ""This is our favorite flavor Tree Hut scrub. Always hard to find in stores because it is usually sold out. Thought it was discontinued, but very happy to find it here."" — AJ "" This Tree Hut Shea Sugar Scrub in the scent Desert Haze is like a little piece of paradise!!!!! The smell is wonderful, and the way it leaves your skin feeling is so smooth, silky, and clean! I will definitely be purchasing this item again! If you haven’t tried this Tree Hut Scrub in the scent Desert Haz,e you should!"" — Shelly Get it from Amazon for $7.97 (also available in 29 other scents). Promising review: ""I have been searching for a sunscreen like this for a long time. I really dislike putting anything heavy on my face and prefer a gel-like consistency. I am a big fan of the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid serum and the texture of this sunscreen feels pretty close to that. I have tried much more expensive 'serum' sunscreens and find this one my favorite and for a much better price point ."" — JHoch Get it from Amazon for $14.88 . This handy travel set includes deluxe sample sizes of Moroccanoil hair treatment, shampoo, conditioner, styling cream, and shower gel. Promising review: ""I thought this promotion was fake, but I ordered it hoping I’d get a good product — and I did! OMG! If you’re thinking about trying Moroccanoil, you can totally start with these minis to see if they work for you. And let me tell you, these products are 100% recommended! They’re perfect as a gift or just for your own use. So worth it!"" — Alehandra Get it from Amazon for $10 . Promising review : ""So comfy and they look just like the photo! The quality is great, they aren't see through, and I love the bright color! They fit true to size. They are definitely a great value for the money."" — Hope Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and 20 styles). Check out a TikTok of the Monday Dry Shampoo in action. Promising review: ""I was thoroughly impressed with this dry shampoo. It's affordable, effective, and everyone compliments how great I smell when I use it. Two bottles lasted me a few months. It does have a white cast, but that can easily be worked into the hair to become undetectable."" — Meg B. Get it from Amazon for $6.97 . Promising review: ""So comfortable and so, so cute! From a pajama lover — I think these might just be my new favorites. I ’ve tried all brands (designer and otherwise) and these top my list without a doubt . The ruffles are such a cute touch! Highly recommend!"" — Melissa Get it from Amazon for $26.99 (available in women's sizes S–XXL and ten colors). Promising review: ""The Sheer For It cheek and lip tint is amazing ! It's surprisingly long-lasting for a more sheer product (but it is definitely buildable). I bought the shade Cherry Cola which is a beautiful, warm, reddish-brown tone. So excited to try the rest of the shades! I highly recommend!!"" — Amy Pomykal Get it from Amazon for $5 (available in four shades). Sayso is a woman-owned small business that specializes in the first-ever cocktail tea bag, perfect for cocktails *and* mocktails. Promising review: ""I’m seriously blown away by the Skinny Spicy Margarita tea bags! As someone who loves a good margarita but doesn’t want all the sugar, this is a total game-changer. It’s super easy — just steep in cold water (or with a splash of tequila if you’re making a cocktail), and you’ve got a refreshing, slightly spicy drink in under a minute. The flavor is chef’s kiss — tangy, zesty, with the perfect little kick . I love that it’s non-GMO, gluten-free, kosher, and vegan too."" — Chioma Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $14.99 (available in four other cocktail styles and larger packs). Check out a TikTok of the Kitsch clip in action. Promising review: ""Just got this today and I love it! I needed something that would keep my hair up, but not pull and not pull it out when I removed it, as well as something that was comfortable and safe to wear while driving . I haven’t driven with it in yet BUT, I am lying in my bed, on my iPad with my head in the pillow and am very comfortable. My new holy grail for putting my hair up. Could not be happier! My hair is long, and moderate thickness, and it holds beautifully."" — Kimberly A. Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in three sizes and five colors). Promising review : ""Really great hand wash! I really can’t believe it is so inexpensive. Enjoy."" — Shar XO Get it from Amazon for $4.94 (available in five scents, including the brand new Lotus Water !). I am obsessed with mine, which I got in the Amethyst Sustain color set (the stickered bottle above). I haven't used a Nalgene since high school but when I lost my usual one and needed a reliable replacement, these were too cute to resist. They are, as always, entirely leakproof, QUITE durable, and most importantly, super lightweight — a boon for me, since I'm a step count monster and always have a tote bag slung over my shoulder. I have gotten more compliments and questions about this adorable bub than any of my water bottles combined! Get it from Amazon for $14+ (available in 15 styles). Black Girl Sunscreen is a Black-owned small business that specializes in sun-protective products that don't leave a white cast. Promising review: "" Best SPF lip gloss I’ve tried at a price you can’t beat. It keeps your lips moisturized long after it’s applied and has no white cast. I also have fairly sensitive skin and this has yet to cause any irritation on my lips which is a huge plus. It's generally impossible to find SPF 50 in any lip product, let alone in a gloss — I will purchase again for sure."" — Ashlee Meckler Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""This is a beautiful scarf. The material is soft and the print is beautiful. I wore it as a belt and as hair accessories. I got many compliments. Definitely a nice piece to add to your collection."" — Yvette Tapia Get it from Amazon for $8.09 (available in 42 styles). Promising review : ""I already love it. The scent is deep and musky, and fills the room quickly without being too strong. Lit it this morning, and it’s been perfect so far. The lid is solid and makes it feel like a high-quality product, not some cheap throwaway. For under $15, you get your money’s worth. Flame is nice and large. Quiet crackle and no smoke. Jar looks good on the table and the wick burns even . It says 110 hours of burn time, so I’ll see if it lasts that long, but I’m betting it will. If you want a candle that smells great and feels worth it, this one’s perfect!"" — MyHonestReviews Get it from Amazon for $15.49 . Schylling is a small business that specializes in modern and retro toys, games, and sets. Promising review: ""NeeDoh makes the absolute best fidgets! These are perfectly soft and squishy. And fun to play with! They’re pretty small, but no less awesome."" — Jessica K Get it from Amazon for $8.28 (available in three fruits, which arrive at random!). Check out the rest of the Needoh fidget toy options on their Amazon storefront! I've sworn by these for years — I can't shape my nails to save my life, so I get a manicure once a month and then trade out these colors every week or so in between . The colors are so vibrant and fun, the quick dry is NO joke, and what I love most is these tend to last a solid five to seven days without chipping (and are easily fixed with a touch-up). I am a very busy bean and incapable of sitting still for more than a minute, so these have been a GODSEND. Promising review: ""This is the best nail polish I've ever used. I have bought it several times and will continue to buy it in the future. I have had my nails done for years at the salon, as well as using the gel polish with the light dry in the past — and now the past year have only used Sally Hansen instant dry nail polishes and am more pleased that I ever was with either of the other options. "" — J.L. Senn Get it from Amazon for $5.98+ (available in dozens of colors).

The pages are single sided which is perfect for coloring with alcohol markers or paint!"" — Sarahsmilecoloring Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review : ""I got these for my girls for Christmas. They are very good quality and comparable to Lululemon.

Also love how many things you can fit in the bigger bag!!"" — Abri M Get it from Amazon for $7.98 (available in 11 styles).

These are designed to work with all hair types! Promising review : ""Obsessed. Super happy and impressed with these hair ties. They are comfy and stretchy and they don't snap or break.

Functional buttons all the way down. Light ribbed fabric and the style is darling!"" — Megan Get it from Amazon for $14.98 (available in women's sizes S–XL and nine colors). Promising review: ""I love this so I ordered a second for backup! Depending on my day I will add no more than one or two drops to my moisturizer or my primer. Takes away the winter pallor of my face which definitely has not had enough sun lately. The bottle is small, but you don’t need to use much. Reasonably priced for the amount. I would say buy it."" — Incognito Get it from Amazon for $5.99 . Promising review: ""It’s lovely. They call it a cover-up, but I wore it with dress pants and a white shell top. I received several compliments. I have purchased a few more in different colors. Nice and long. Comfortable. Seems durable so far. Don’t wear it for warmth though, — it might protect from sun or a slight breeze, but it is more for looks than warmth."" — MAC Get it from Amazon for $12.74+ (available in women's sizes S–5X and 40 styles). Promising review : ""Love these drops. So effective, a little goes a long way. Great for a boost of hydration, especially in the colder and/or drier months. Great as a primer before makeup to smooth the skin. Such a value for a product that packs a punch. My skin hasn't looked better!"" — Ken Get it from Amazon for $11.97 . All you need to do to create the foam is stir it with a spoon, but reviewers note it gets an even BIGGER froth with a cheap hand frother !

If you are looking for a great tasting latte at home, this really is perfect."" — Kathleen Suarez Get a pack of six from Amazon for $6.97 (available in three flavors).

This stuff took it right out without a problem!!"" — Micaela Gunderson ""I was trying to get adhesive off of drywall and nothing was working. THIS WORKS on everything!

My clothes come out of the dryer noticeably wrinkle-free and feel soft. I’ve also noticed a slight reduction in drying time, which is a bonus for saving energy. They’re reusable and chemical-free, making them a healthy, eco-friendly alternative to dryer sheets."" — Avinash Get it from Handy Laundry on Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""When I travel, my lips get so chapped! It's painful. I found this product when I searched for something for extremely chapped lips. I've used other O'Keeffe's products, so I trusted the brand. I used this as directed in the morning and before bed, and my lips healed faster than ever. Also, on the next trip I went on, I took it with me and used it daily. My lips stayed healthy and didn't get chapped at all. This stuff is magic, and I won't go anywhere without it now."" — Anna C. Adams Get it from Amazon for $8.99 . Promising review: ""I LOVE these little fish. I’ve been using them for about 2.5 years now, and I truly believe they help keep the humidifier and water cleaner. People don’t realize all the nasty mold and bacteria that can be growing in their humidifier and then released into the air in their room! I’ve noticed a huge difference in mold growth when I use these fish."" — Shelly Get it from Amazon for $5.98 . Promising review: ""Why didn’t someone think of this sooner? For years, I’ve been using cotton buds dipped in makeup remover to remove little goofs or mistakes. This is so much better and portable! Erases waterproof mascara marks around my eyes easily. Must-buy product!!"" — Katherine Get it from Amazon for $9.89 . Promising review: ""My tea mug was horrible: 'stainless' steel that was totally brown from tea. It's now shiny and silver again. I used it on my coffee mug and my gym water bottle as well, and they're all like new! Highly recommend and works super fast. No scent during or after use."" — afK2 Get 12 tablets from Amazon for $7.99 . Promising review: ""I saw this on TikTok and very much thought of it as an impulsive purchase at first for its $25 price tag. But no, this is a very, very necessary item in my day-to-day life. It does a wayyy wayyy better dang job than a lint roller or other products that rival this. My mother picked up something from a competitor, and it did not clean up the hair as well as this did. I keep getting these for my pet-owning friends as gifts because it's truly a holy grail product. I like that it picks up human hair, too, because, as a long-hair haver, I can shed about as much as my cat does. It's a durable product, too. I've had mine for about a year now, and it still works like it used to, and it's fairly easy to clean the inside."" — Connie Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I saw this product mentioned in so many articles about cheap products that are great. I don't know what took me so long to purchase this, but I am kicking myself for waiting!! My hair is DAMAGED. Beyond fried. I've bleached it so many times. I am consistently changing my hair color, and while the semi-permanent dyes don't hurt it, the bleach sure does! My hair always feels like straw. My hair looks and feels INCREDIBLE!!! It is so soft and I am just absolutely in love!

I kept one for myself and gave the other to my daughter."" — Shari Schmidt Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in three set sizes). This medium-coverage concealer can be applied with your fingers or a brush. Promising review: ""I believe I was born with dark circles under my eyes, and I have spent the last 50+ years looking for something that will cover my dark circles. I’ve spent a lot more money on products that do a lot less. And I was very hesitant to buy something so inexpensive as I thought it would not work. I was surprised to find my circles a lot lighter, and my eyes are looking much more alert and younger. I’m very pleased with this product!"" — Lafinrsm Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four tones). Promising review: “I had no idea that cleaning a Keurig was a thing. I bought these because I saw them on TikTok, believe it or not. I wanted to give it a go because my Keurig isn’t that old and I didn’t think it would do anything. IT WORKS SO WELL! My Keurig wasn’t as nasty as some I’ve seen luckily. I would highly recommend. Keeps everything running correctly and clean .” — Lauren Get a six-pack from Amazon for $9.95 . They're compatible with the original Swiffer Sweeper ! Turbo Mops is a family-run small business that wants to help you live (and clean) more sustainably. Promising review: ""The Velcro closure alone is worth the purchase. It was really easy to put on (no more pinched fingers) and the hold is very strong. No more having to handle the dirty, drippy sheets to try to reattach them in the middle of cleaning the floor. I noticed that my floors are cleaner because the microfiber absorbs more and doesn't just push the grime around the floor. Also, these can be washed in the washing machine for the next use."" — Rosemary Patterson Get a pack of two from Turbo Mops on Amazon for $16.99 . Promising review: ""I was surprised what a difference these new shower curtain hooks made. They slide SOOOO much better across the shower curtain rod than the ones I had previously. There are also two hooks (one on each side), making it a breeze to change out or wash the shower curtain liner without removing the shower curtain. This saves so much time and aggravation!!! I will be purchasing this type from now until forever!"" — MaryMaryinLA Get it from Amazon for $7.49+ (available in 16 colors). Promising review: ""I don't like to talk about it, but every year my nose becomes super dry to the point where I sometimes get a bloody nose. I usually use some squeeze saline, but it got so bad this year that I decided to get this gel. A dab on a finger or a swab and my nose is hydrated, moistened, and not dry as a desert. No winter bloody noses! It is very light, is not slimy or like Vaseline, and it does not have any smell."" — Catherine Get it from Amazon for $3.62 . Promising review: ""I love WD-40 products and use them for everything. I spray on shovels to keep dirt or snow from sticking, spray around windows and thresholds to deter bugs, clean Sharpies off wood and walls, and, of course, stop squeaky doors. These small direct-point application pens are great. Keep one in the glove box, my kitchen 'junk' drawer, and in the house toolbox."" — BBP623 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $12.86 . Promising reviews: ""I had tried lots of white vinegar for two cycles in my 20-year-old dishwasher for the cloudy and powdery dinginess it had started making, and it only helped about 30%. We have very hard water. These tablets zapped the buildup, and my glass is clear again, and colored plastics no longer have the powder-like coating. So glad I took a chance on this!"" — J. Holden Get six tablets from Amazon for $8.99 . Promising review: ""So I decided to put these to the ultimate test for 4th of July underneath my white, semi-sheer swimsuit. I wore them out in the Florida heat in the ocean all day, and they did not budge or peel off. I thought for sure these would take skin off by the time I got home because I just couldn't believe they stayed on the entire day (humidity is real). I was able to remove them with ease. I washed them with warm water and soap and let them dry, and the next day, they were super sticky, like they were brand new out of the package again. Buying these forever."" — Marisa Get it from Amazon for $26.50+ (available in three sizes and five shades). BuzzFeed editor Natalie Brown swears by these pasties! Check out her Nippies review to learn more. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic . Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you.

Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" — Angela Leonard Get it from Amazon for $11.93 . Promising review: ""This stuff works really well. My cabinets had dry spots on them. This cleaned everything right up and gave them new life. I will be using this forever on my wood products."" — Kindle Customer Get it from Amazon for $8.76 . Promising review: ""I had hair extensions put in a couple of months ago. My stylist said I shouldn’t wash my hair every day in order to make the hair last longer. I was an 'every day' washer pre-extensions. She had given me a dry shampoo spray. I didn’t feel like it did anything. At my last appointment, she gave me a dry powder. It seemed to do the trick. I got online and found the price of the product she had given me to be $50. I started looking for other options that were less pricey and found this. I feel like it works better than the $50 product my stylist gave me! I am one week without washing my hair and it looks like I just washed it this morning! My hair feels like hair. This product doesn’t leave any color or any thick buildup. It’s easy to apply. This will be my new go-to . Five stars!"" — Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in six shades). Promising review: ""I've been using this for five days, and I can't believe how much it's helped with the saggy skin under my chin. I'm 37, and I've been using various products, but nothing was making a difference, and my skin continued to get loose in that area. I came across this, looked at the reviews, and decided to try it, though I honestly wasn't sure it would work for me, considering other things I've tried that haven't helped. I can't even express how much better I feel now. I have no idea how this cream works and actually tightens up the skin, but I'm so grateful. I'm no longer self-conscious about it, and I actually like looking in the mirror now and not seeing the extra skin hanging from the bottom of my chin. "" — 📚#WHYCHOOSE Get it from Amazon for $11.19 . Promising reviews: ""LOVE it. It took three minutes to cut grapes, which would have taken me at least 10 [by hand]. As a mom of a toddler, those minutes are precious. It was also fun and easy to use."" — Jacqueline ""I wish I would’ve had this a LONG time ago. This little gadget has come in so handy. If you have a toddler or small child, you NEED this. It quarters grapes, cherry tomatoes, olives, etc., so they aren’t choking hazards for little ones. So much faster than slicing every tiny grape up yourself. 10/10 would recommend."" — Sara Waits Get it from Amazon for $11.76 . Promising review: ""Takes away that gross smell. It seems counterintuitive to put a little packet down your garbage disposal to clean it, but this does actually seem to work, at least for getting out weird smells that baking soda and vinegar don't really touch. I scrub the sink down first, especially around the garbage disposal area, rinse it down, and then just follow the directions on the package. I have used it with single, large-size sinks and with double sinks — the only difference is that the double sink will have blue cleaning foam rise up the drain, which you rinse away when the disposal sounds clear again. I have tried the foaming cleaner in a can, but unfortunately, it stopped coming out of the can about 10% of the way through. Went back to this tried and true."" — KS Get two packs of four from Amazon for $6.80 . Promising review: ""I absolutely hate cleaning my shower. I'd rather clean my toilet 10 times than blow my back out by cleaning my shower once. Prior to this, I was using drill brushes and a suite of different chemicals, which still managed to be highly labor intensive and never got my shower truly 'clean.' This stuff gets it shiny, and I'll be using this forever."" — Jake Get it from Amazon for $20.98 (available in two scents). Promising review: ""Wow! First of all, I was shocked when I noticed that my toilet tank was so filthy. I never looked in there, but there was a reason that my toilet bowl needed to be scrubbed every day. The tank was so nasty I couldn't even see the bottom. I really didn't want to drain the water and scrub the tank, then I saw this. I honestly didn't expect that it would actually work since my tank was so nasty. I dumped this little miracle product in the tank, left it overnight, and the next morning, I saw a much cleaner tank. I can actually see in there now. No draining or scrubbing. Amazing stuff!"" — Linda Baker Get it from Amazon for $7.07 . Promising review: ""Like you, when I first came across this, I was hesitant because of the price. It's a bit steep, I thought to myself. But then, after another night of bathtime with two towels on the ground to soak up the water my child had splashed all over, I took the plunge and bought it. And definitely worth it a million times over. My child LOVES the extra space for toys and I love the water staying in the tub. I definitely and highly suggest buying it. You won't be disappointed! Or your child!!"" — Brianna Get it from Amazon for $59.95 (available in four colors). Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, specializing in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed for deeper cleans. Here's what writer Emma Lord has to say: ""I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively."" Promising review: ""I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth — it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!"" — Jason A. Get a pair from Mouthwatchers on Amazon for $9.99 (also available as a four-pack ). Promising review: ""We have two kittens who share a litter box and produce a surprising amount of waste for such tiny guys! As a result, the odor was getting out of control. I bought this based on other reviews and have been using it for a few weeks. It really works! I’ve used it with regular clay litter and now pine, and it works well with both. It’s been helping to keep the odor to a bare minimum, even when we forget to scoop for a little bit. Highly recommend!"" — ktrammell Get it from Amazon for $11.99 . Promising review: ""Why didn’t I buy this sooner? Turned my kid's frizzy curly hair into the most beautiful ringlets."" — Lindsay Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""I wanted something that would clean my baby’s paws after our walks because I didn’t want germs or dirt coming into the house. It smells great, it works well, and I can see that the rubber part doesn’t bother my doggy! It’s super easy to use, and I use it to keep her paws clean and my house clean! 10/10, especially for the price point!"" — Thia Get it from Amazon for $6.24 . Promising review: ""Very satisfied. I tried everything to remove the black mold with no success. This product actually worked to remove the black mold. I applied the gel to the mold and left it to sit overnight. I was amazed the mold wiped off with a rag."" — Robin S. Johns Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""I wish I had found these sooner!! These cold sores were probably the worst I've had and wouldn't clear up or stop itching/hurting. I googled cold sore remedies, and these happened to pop up. After reading the reviews, I immediately ordered them. They came right on time, and I put them on before bed last night. It's been less than 36 hours, and these cold sores are already healing beautifully. I plan to order another pack or three, so I can keep one at home, one in my purse, and one in my locker at work so if I ever feel the warning tingle/itching of a new breakout, I can slap one of these bad boys on and get rid of it quickly! Highly recommend for my fellow cold sore sufferers."" — Jessica Hill Get a pack of 15 from Amazon for $13.87+ (also available in a two-pack). Note: This product is not an overnight miracle. Apply this 2–3 times a day, be patient, and you'll likely start to see the results. Talk to your doctor before attempting to treat your keloid on your own, and learn more about keloids from Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""This product is amazing! Truly a miracle product. I had an AWFUL keloid forming near my nose piercing about six weeks after getting it done and it was getting bigger and more irritated by the day, nothing was helping. I bought this and started using it and in less than two weeks my huge keloid was completely gone! I was definitely skeptical and a little nervous when it didn’t seem to be getting noticeably smaller after a week but then the second week, it started totally disappearing so give it some time to work if your bump is on the larger side. If you remain patient and apply it twice a day, it should do the trick!"" — Jordan Caprigno Get it from Amazon for $12.85 (also available in multipacks). Promising review: "" This little pen brush is incredible! I wasn't sure if it would work well on my emerald engagement ring since it's mostly advertised for diamonds, but I thought I'd give it a try. I have been wearing the ring since getting engaged in October, and even though I had it cleaned at the jeweler's in April, it just didn't seem as bright as it was when it was new, and I thought it would just always be a little cloudy. But after cleaning it once with the Dazzle Stik, I was blown away by the difference — it looks as bright and sparkly as when I first got it! I'm so glad I didn't buy an ultrasonic cleaner since this is so much less expensive and easier and gentler — it took me less than a minute to clean, and I can do it whenever I want! And it's honestly better than when the jeweler cleaned it. So thrilled!"" — KFray Get it from Amazon for $9.48 .

On Assignment For HuffPost With a 4.8-star rating, this swivel chair is so popular that the retailer can’t keep it in stock — multiple reviews on Walmart’s website describe victorious customers pouncing on long-awaited restocks. The chair is a dead ringer for similar options from Article and West Elm that can retail for up to $2,000. According to the many customer reviews, the seat doesn’t skimp on quality — it’s praised for its high quality, elevated design, and the the fact that it comes pre-assembled. It also doesn’t take up a ton of room either at 34 inches wide and 27.5 inches tall. That means if you have a small space, it won’t crowd you. The outer material is sherpa, which is both fluffy and knit. “Such great quality! Super soft and comfortable! I ordered one to test it out, fell in love and now it’s out of stock so I’m stalking for a second one,” wrote customer Kimberly in a review . It bears repeating that this chair sells out fast, so if you’re eyeing it, it’s best to act quickly instead of waiting. Scroll ahead to read some customer testimonials and score one for yourself. “I absolutely love my chair. It looks amazing in person, and I’m just so happy that I decided to wait for it to come back in stock rather than buying a different chair. You will not be disappointed, and the shipping was s,o so fast!!!!” — CoCo “ Get [them] when you can! These chairs are constantly out of stock for a reason. They are so pretty, fit most any room, and are super comfy. I missed out twice but finally got two, and I couldn’t be happier with them.” — Shelley “It’s on the small size but not much smaller than the identical one they sell at West Elm for $800.” — tami408 “I was so glad when it came back in stock. My husband thought I was nuts when he unpacked it, but he loves it. It is insanely comfortable.” — Rochelle Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:49:11.833655+00:00

Get dirt and grime off your walkway, fences, patio, the sides of your house and even your car. HuffPost Shopping Writer With a 4.8-star rating, it’s a user-friendly model that reviewers say they recommend for “every household.” “I cleaned outdoor teak furniture with it, made them look like new!” one review said . “I cleaned my deck, dirty from years...I was shocked with the results.” “It has saved me time and a broken back washing my very large deck,” wrote another. Get dirt and grime off your walkway, fences, patio, outdoor furniture, the sides of your house, and even your car with this user-friendly and nimble machine. Unlike bulky gas-powered washers, this electric option only weighs 31 pounds and doesn’t use any oil or give off any noxious emissions. Yet users say it still gives impressive results. (It’s also Wirecutter’s “budget pick” for the pressure washer category.) “I’ve found the washer powerful enough to get the job done in a single pass without soap or solvents,” one review said. “It cut right through a couple of years of redwood pollen and moss without any trouble.” Outputting 1.2 gallons per minute with 2,030 pounds of pressure per square inch — it packs a big punch for a small machine. The dual-tank system lets you carry two different cleaning solutions. “I like the way it mixes in detergent,” a reviewer who cleaned their garbage cans, area rugs , and minivan said, “Powerful sprayer with choice of different nozzles.” Included with the machine is an easy-connect spray gun with a steel tip and a 35-foot kink-resistant hose for those hard-to-reach places. It also comes with five quick-connect spray nozzles for different angles. One review jokes that the biggest issue you’ll have will be keeping it in your home, as “everyone tries to borrow it all the time.” If you’re trying to give your place a scrub to get ready for summer, grab yours today while it’s still on sale. Want to hear more? Read some of the promising reviews of the Sun Joe 2030 pressure washer . “ This product is something every homeowner should have . So many uses, and great quality so far.” — Dawn dawn “ Let me tell you, this thing is a beast. Have used this to clean the sidewalk, vinyl siding, fencing, and hockey court. Highly recommended.” — Mr Oilman “I love this machine — it is light, powerful, easy to use, easy to assemble, and does a fantastic job on cars, moldy patios, house walls. I had a prior gas-powered power washer that was loud, smelly, and constantly breaking down. Never again. Thanks, Sun Joe!” — DelOro “Perfect for any homeowner. Excellent power. Easy to set up and use. Just cleaned my white PVC fence and a ton of decorative stone work, and the results were fantastic ” — LenGraz “ It’s so easy to operate. I don’t know how I got along without it. The yard and garage have never been so clean. I highly recommend this machine. Lightweight and heavy-duty. THANX!!!” — cooker “ Very effective and easy to use for the price. Cleaned a huge deck that had been neglected for five years!” — Harleyjoe “We purchased our first SunJoe pressure washer in 2015 to take care of our FL home. Due to the weather here, we’re susceptible to mold, moss, dust, dirt, grime. We always have something that needs pressure washing. We just purchased a replacement this year when the first one, after nearly 10 years of heavy service finally gave out. It’s been used by every member of the family, including two teenage boys who’ve accidentally dropped the entire pressure washer into the pool while cleaning the pool deck several times. It just keeps on working... Great investment for homeowners. ” — FL Mom Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:49:12.429629+00:00

HuffPost Staff HuffPost Shopping Writer Why did I go from zero Kasa plugs to 10, and why should you? It’s an easy-to-install, tiny but incredibly effective home tech gadget that upgrades every outlet in your home into one you can control by app or voice assistant. No rewiring the house or hiring of an electrician is needed. This automation might sound complicated or technically intimidating, but I promise, you don’t need to be tech-savvy to set it up. So, every time we spot them on sale, we’ve got to let you know. Set up is easier than you could dream possible — plug it in, press a button to connect it to Wi-Fi, add it to the phone app, and live your smart-plug-full life. Why does this matter? I’m glad you asked. Now, I can adjust my houseplants' grow lights if I’m halfway around the world. I can leave an appliance running and turn it off while running errands. I can use my smart plugs to make it appear someone is always home or schedule them around my work and travel schedules. I’ve set a bedroom air purifier to turn on an hour before bedtime and off in the morning, right as my living room air purifier is scheduled to turn on. Doing this with a coffee maker is an absolute no-brainer. And in the summer, having more control over your AC or fans, now that’s living life right. Once you install the plugs, they are the definition of a “one and done” home upgrade you’ll enjoy for ages. In the years (plural) I’ve been using these every day , I’ve never had an issue with dropped connections or an inability to find Wi-Fi. The Kasa app is straightforward, and if you prefer, you can simply use Alexa or Google Home instead to control your outlets via voice. One thing I love most about the Kasa mini smart plugs is the size. At 2.4 inches long and 1.5 inches high, they’re small enough to leave the other socket of the outlet free without covering it up or making it impossible to plug something else in. If you’re ready to make your home a little smarter and a lot easier, grab a set of Kasa plugs while they’re on sale. Hear from other happy Kasa smart plug users before grabbing your own 4-pack. “I might have a problem: I have 30 of these things powering various lamps, speakers, and neon lights scattered throughout my home. They integrated seamlessly with my Alexa devices, so all I have to do is tell Alexa to turn on X device and — presto! No getting up. No searching for switches. No reaching awkwardly behind furniture. All my guests are super impressed, and I feel like I’m living in a promised future of convenience. Get the four packs to save $$.” — Phil Lander “ I’ve used so many different smart plugs over the years. Most I got rid of because I didn’t like having so many different apps for things that didn’t work with SmartLife. The Kasa app was one I didn’t mind having, since I rarely use the app, and everything is voice-controlled via Alexa . Easy to set up, and probably the most reliable ones I’ve found. And I like that they persist the state they were in if you lose power. Some, if you lose power while they’re on, when power is restored will stay off. Not these.” — LegoDude “A friend of mine sent me here to get these. I had not heard of them, but they sounded like a great idea. I t is nice to come home to lights after we’ve been out of the house. It’s also comforting to know that the lights will be on while I’m away, so it appears as if somebody is at home. Even when the lights are on a schedule I’ve set, I can turn them on and off if I need to with my phone in my hand. They are very easy to set up on the app .” — Karoleigh “I live in an over 100 year old home. Not all electrical was updated so I use these for lamps since I don’t have enough light switches. I have everything connected to Alexa. So I have several orders of these. They turn on/off my living room TV, bedroom TV, both master bedroom lamps, laundry lamp, floor lamp in living room, table lamp in living room, and office light. I also have for my Christmas Tree every year. I will never not have these . It’s so much easier to tell Alexa to do it than doing it yourself. I’ve been having them for years now, and none of them ever died on me. I never have issues with them not being connected. They are super easy to set up. They’re a bit thick, so just make sure wherever you’re plugging it in, it will have space (like behind furniture). It’s easy, you won’t regret these. Excuse all the plugs in my photo! This one is for my bedroom lamps on each side of the bed.” — Erika Levet Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:49:13.038450+00:00

Since I got this mower, it saves me time and energy. This is the best electric mower I’ve ever used. The battery is enough to finish my 9,000 square feet yard without a recharge. It’s quiet. The self-propelled feature is very smooth and easy to control the speed. The most impressive part is the dual-blade. You better try this."" — Taka Price: $599.99 (originally $998) Promising review: ""We purchased this camera about 18 months ago and it has now paid for itself 100x over when it provided evidence to the police and insurance that my wife was not the one at fault in an accident that totaled her vehicle, and the other party lied to the police. It was easy to install and had clear instructions. Great suction cup with integrated GPS antenna, which made installation a breeze. The camera will slide off the mount if you want to hide it while parked without removing the entire mount. Crystal clear video, front at 4k and back at 2k, produces high resolution video where you can read license plates and even identify who was driving another vehicle."" — Prime Risk Price: $89.99 (typically $129.99) This is designed with double-layer filters and a 7-stage spiral auger to help avoid heat generation and oxidation.

It worked great! I was able to put it up and down all by myself. I left the canopy on when I put it back into the bag, which made it that much faster to go up and down. I didn't stake it down the first night, and it survived a wild rainstorm without moving. Super easy to use, and lots of space underneath! "" — Jennifer Work Price : $99.99 (originally $159.99; available in 30 colors) Promising review : ""Fantastic product. Hubby agreed to buy it if I made at least one smoked dish per month. It was delivered on April 23. Today is May 20, and right now I’m smoking my sixth dish — a spatchcocked chicken. The packaging they do is brilliant, and putting it together (you’ve really gotta have a second person) was super easy. Clearly, the entire design was very well thought out, from the product itself to the packaging. Have been mulling over getting a pellet smoker (yes, I understand that stick smokers rule) for about a year, and I am so happy with this purchase. Absolutely recommend this smoker to anyone who wants to take the dive into smoking food. We’ve done ribs (both regular and Berkshire), whole skin-on salmon, and now chicken. Love, love, love, my Traeger. "" — Lauren Price : $389 (originally $549.99) Promising review: ""We have been using this in muggy Houston. We put this under the pergola, and it puts out so much air that we actually enjoy sitting outside. We use it both with and without the mister.

I use super-sized shampoo, body wash, etc., and didn’t think this would hold the weight of them, but they really do! I like the design of this one specifically because I can hang my bath scrunchie and detangling comb right off the hoops on the sides, and nothing drips onto them. If you need shelving in your shower, give these a try. This is a game changer for me."" — Rachel Price: $17.99+ (typically $24.99+; available in five colors – not all included in sale) Promising review: ""Put it in my bedroom, it works great. It not only keeps my air cleaner. It also cools my room down a couple of degrees, and I appreciate that for sleeping, especially. It is super super quiet, and well worth the money I spent. The fact that I can clean it usually 3 to 4 times during the summer months and more during winter months makes it convenient, and it is an expensive and well worth the money."" — Crystal Baldwin Price: $39.99 (clip the $10 off coupon for this price, originally $49.99; available in two colors). Promising review : ""I love the quality and strength of these tools. It has been a major upgrade from what I had before. I love that it doesn’t weigh much; I can throw it on the back of the truck and go. It has slip resistance so it won’t slide around, and you can lock the drawers so they won’t pop out either. The design stores the three different drive sizes, which is super convenient. It’s also modular, so you can add it to your tool case, which is very functional in my case."" — David Price: $99 (originally $199.99) Promising review: ""The best umbrella I've owned to date. The first one I bought had a defect, but I reached out to their customer service, and they replied and sent a replacement very quickly. Very durable against the winds, it's small and fits in my backpack's side pocket. The large strap that wrapped around the umbrella keeps it looking neat when closed. The button for opening and closing the umbrella is easy to use as well."" — SJ Price: $14.98+ (originally $29.99; available in 25 colors and packs of two) P.S. reviewers also recommend this value pack for small business shipping! Promising review: ""This six-roll value pack of heavy-duty tape, delivering outstanding value for packing and shipping tasks. Tape adhesive grips firmly to cardboard, paperboard, and plastic surfaces without splitting or losing tack even in high humidity. Each roll tears by hand cleanly along a straight line, and cores fit standard dispensers. Durability under stress is excellent—sealed boxes withstand stacking and rough handling. Rolls stack neatly for storage, and edges remain intact without curling over time. Ideal for both home moves and small business shipping, this set outperforms midrange alternatives at a similar price ."" — Amazon Customer Price: $13.19 (originally $19.99) Promising review : ""I don’t see how you can beat this tablet, especially at this price. I wanted a super light tablet, mostly to read with, and watch some movies. I love the built in blue filter and was surprised to learn that it works with me!

Promising review : ""I got tired of changing line on my other weed whacker so I purchased the E- GO IQ it is bigger than my old one but it sure is more powerful, love how it keeps the line feeding to the perfect length, very easy one button line rewinding. You can adjust the length of the shaft very easy, battery last a long time well worth the money."" — JACK DYGERT Price: $299.99 (originally 559.98). Promising review : ""This desk is wonderful! I got it to switch from a stationary to a sit/stand desk. I liked that the desktop was one solid piece (vs some that are 2 pieces), and I liked the combination of desktop and desk leg colors. My dad and I worked to put this together, and it took us about an hour. All the of the screws and things needed came in nicely labeled bags and it was really easy to figure out what we needed to use. You do need to supply your own screwdriver or drill. Once put together, it was easy to set the default heights for sitting and standing. The desk is actually pretty quiet when it moves! It is not super fast to raise/lower, but it moves along at a nice pace, and everything feels sturdy when it's moving. I have been using this for about a week now and I love it!"" — Amazon Customer Price: $109.98 (originally $169.99) Promising review : ""I love my luggage set! They look gorgeous, and honestly, the quality is excellent. I’ve taken 15-day trips using only the carry-on and the personal bag — it’s amazing. At first, I thought they’d get dirty easily since they’re white, but they’re actually very easy to clean. The toiletry bag fits my Shark FlexStyle hair dryer and all the attachments perfectly."" — Mariana R. Price: $69.98 (originally $99.99).

Our house has many obstacles to get around, and it hasn’t gotten stuck once! Transitions from area rugs to hardwood floors easily and it really gets the area we miss with the vacuum. Have it set up to run when we’re out of the house, and it picks up so much hair and dust. I was skeptical buying an off brand but the reviews and research made me take a chance, highly recommend to save you some time and ease of mind. Haven’t used the mop function yet but will try it out soon!"" — nick valaris Price: $419.99 (originally $659.99). Promising review : ""I’ve tried a number of charging stands, but this one is truly in a league of its own. The design is sleek, modern, and thoughtfully engineered—it feels like it belongs in a high-end tech showroom. The charging speed is blazing fast, effortlessly powering my devices while keeping everything neatly in place. My nightstand has never looked so tidy and streamlined. If they ever develop a version that includes space for an iPad, it would be the ultimate all-in-one solution!"" — Edmal Price: $63.99 (originally $89.99; available in two colors).

Beyond just the results, the ease of use has completely transformed my approach to flossing. No more struggling with traditional floss or worrying about missing tricky spots.

I emptied the vacuum and then vacuumed one more time, and there was nothing left to draw out. Clean clean clean! Easy assembly, highly effective, and super easy to maneuver . I tried all the attachments and can't pick a favorite! Bravo, Dyson, bravo! Recommended it to all my coworkers, friends, and family. I want everyone to feel this excited about vacuuming!"" — Julie W. Price : $299.99 (typically $399.99) Promising reviews: "" I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores; it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and were left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this well on everyone on the first try, and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff. 🩷"" — Losa ""I have hyperpigmentation and oily skin. I feel this product regulates my oil production and it helps my makeup look so flawless. 10/10."" — MissKayMae Price: $13.95+ (typically $25+; available in two sizes) Promising review: ""If you're looking to stay organized on the go for yourself or with kids, I cannot recommend this enough! I've used packing cubes before that were poor quality. The quality of this product exceeded my expectations. The material and zippers are lightweight yet durable. Packing for my daughter and me on our last trip was a breeze with these packing cubes! Highly highly recommend!"" — es86 Price : $14.44 (typically $24.99) Promising review : ""We got these to pack in our suitcases for a beach trip and they were perfect! They fit nicely in our suitcases, which was important. They weigh closer to 7 pounds, so they're not the lightest, but they still worked. They are very easy to set up and very comfortable! The cup holder is a great feature, too."" — lucas Price : $31.99 (typically $50.99) Promising review : ""I am extremely impressed with this hair dryer! It’s lightweight, quiet, and very strong . It’s perfect for using at home or taking on your vacations! I even use it at the rentals we stay at when my kids are sleeping right next to the bathroom, and they don’t wake up. The motor dries my hair efficiently and quickly without my hair getting any heat damage. The item comes with a diffuser and nozzle attachments. I am so happy that I have this hair dryer. I highly recommend."" — Sarah Karhnack Price : $59.99 (typically $119.99) Promising review: ""This is the second walking pad I have purchased, and this one is by far my favorite. I have a standing desk that I use it with, and it's so compact that it fits neatly under my loveseat in my office. Super easy setup, overall great value! The speed options are great as well, and overall it works great! It also does not make a horrible sound when I use it, unlike the previous one I owned (from a different brand)."" — Keihra Price : $149.99 (typically $199.99) Promising review: ""These were a lifesaver! We used them while at multiple theme parks in the summer, and they have worked wonderfully. The fact that they clip to your waist, hold your shirt down, and blow air up your shirt is a way better way to keep cool than just an external fan. I have bought several of these, and would highly recommend! A couple of these lasted all day, as long as you are not constantly running them full blast."" — Greg Price : 19.98 (typically $29.99) Promising review: ""These are my absolute favorite pens. I feel like they are priced pretty fair for how many you get in one package. I love all the different colors. They feel good and have a nice weight to them. They don’t skip or bleed."" — Jessica Butler Price : $9.65 (typically $15) Promising review: ""This works great!! I’ve had a mouth guard for a few years now that I wear at night. I used to keep it in a plastic Tupperware and every other day use a cleaning tablet in it, brush it every day, and deep clean it once a month. It still didn’t feel clean enough. I researched affordable and effective ultrasonic cleaners and found this one and LOVE it! I also used it for my metal watch band, and it came out so shiny! Definitely worth the investment."" — Amazon Customer Price : $37.98 (typically $50) Check out a TikTok of the plug-in fly trap in action. Promising review: ""I can’t say enough wonderful things about these handy little bug catchers! They are simple to use, cheap to refill, and catch a ton of small bugs and flies.

Price : $12.97 (typically $17.97; also available as a two-pack) Promising review: ""I use these every day at work! Love these — easy to learn and to use. Best thing about them? Well, everything, lol. Good sound, they hold a charge for long periods, and I don’t have to worry about them losing power. I can answer my phone easily and then go back to music without a problem. Definitely a great buy and worth the money! Love this color, too!"" — Erin ""These are the best quality earbuds for the price! I found them through TikTok and have zero regrets. I’d definitely repurchase if needed."" — Hamrick Price : $27.99+ (typically $37.99; available in nine colors) Promising review : ""I just took this on a week-long camping trip on a lake in northern Maine. It worked great! I was able to put it up and down all by myself. I left the canopy on when I put it back into the bag, which made it that much faster to go up and down. I didn't stake it down the first night, and it survived a wild rainstorm without moving. Super easy to use, and lots of space underneath!

Promising review: ""I recently purchased a bread knife, and it has become an essential tool in my kitchen. The serrated blade effortlessly slices through various types of bread, providing clean and even cuts. The ergonomic handle ensures a comfortable grip, making it easy to maneuver.

It is sturdy and comes with a carrying case."" — DLB Price: $79.98 (originally $115.99) Check out a TikTok of the charger in action. Promising review: ""I used these several times for the past year, traveling for business and leisure. It is always a challenge to find an outlet at the airport since some airports do not offer a charging station. Using those types can also be a security risk. That's why I love using these portable chargers. They are lightweight and fit in my travel handbag/or small backpack pocket. The portable chargers take about 30–35 minutes to fully charge if dead. Once charged, they charge fast and hold a charge for many hours."" — J Price : $11.99+ (typically $18.99; available in six colors). Promising review : ""I've had this for almost a year. It's excellent. Durable, easily maneuverable. My eight-year-old nephew can pull it with his brothers and beach picnic items inside. I pull it easily full of heavy groceries on grassy, uneven ground. Folds away very easily. Worth every cent."" — Anjay Ennis Price : $107.49 (typically $149.99) Promising review: ""This thing is a beast. I appreciate having the ability to just throw my soliciting mail in it without having to open it up first. It seems like many companies are putting packers in their mailers that are there just to discourage straight-to-shredder practices. Plastic cards, extra-thick card stocks, 20 sheets of rubbish, etc. With this shredder, I don't have to deal with any of that. I don't even open mailers anymore. If I don't recognize its intended purpose, in it goes."" — Darkflame808 Price : $28.89 (typically $39.34; available in two colors and four sizes) Promising review: ""Great little planner. The cover print is really cute. I like planners with a monthly page at the start of each month, and the weekly pages have plenty of room to write. Exactly what I was looking for."" — Momo Price: $6.79 (typically $9.99; available in 14 styles) Each hanger holds 10 pairs of leggings. Promising review: ""Yes...I have too many clothes.

I started having breakouts. I saw this on TikTok so I decided to purchase . Since I've been using these, I no longer have breakouts. The towel is soft to the skin and works very well since I have sensitive skin. I will most definitely purchase again."" — India Freeman Price : $9.49 (typically $12.99) Promising review : ""These navy blue bed sheets are perfect if you’re looking for something that feels cool and comfortable throughout the night.

Psst — a lot of folks also use these for pancake and protein pancake bites! Promising review: ""I bought this in hopes to make egg bites similar to Starbucks and I have not been disappointed. I chose this one after reading reviews on the smaller four-bite size. I have used it multiple times and have had excellent results each time. I followed the recipe in the booklet and used a tip from another reviewer that suggested to triple the cottage cheese amount. It’s very easy to use and clean."" — April124 ""I work pretty much work 13 days straight and this egg bite maker is perfect for meal prepping so I can stay on the go. It also saves me money by not going through any drive through to get a quick breakfast.

Literallyyyyy it’s so easy to use, it doesn’t take me an hour to shave anymore, so I save so much time. I hated shaving so much because it took so long and was to tedious but now it’s so easy????? Please buy this thing, it is probably the best thing I’ve purchased on Amazon ever.

Take it from someone who just graduated, you need this rapid coffee brewer that can get you out the door in two minutes. BuzzFeed Staff This coffee brewer can create heavenly hot coffee in five minutes or crispy cold brew in just two. All components screw easily apart and back together while you brew your jazzy java, all you need is to add your favorite fine coffee grounds and hot or cold water to the appropriate sections. Since it's concentrated, make sure to dilute it — or maybe not if you need the extra jolt after staying up all night practicing your first day introduction. Promising review: ""This is almost like a hand-operated espresso machine. I like to give it a couple of extra pumps to extract some cream too. It's super easy to use and has upped my coffee game . I used a French press for a long time, but I always hated how much sludge there was at the bottom of my coffee. With this, there are nearly no solids passing through. You can also make iced coffee by using cold water and just letting it sit longer. It tastes good that way, too. If you like making strong coffee, or Americanos, or cappuccinos, and don't want to pay lots of money for an espresso machine, this is the next best thing. Works better than those cheap espresso machines."" — JM Gustafson Get it from Amazon for $39.99. Promising review: ""The images and descriptions are 100% accurate about this custom stationery product. The card stock is just the right weight, and the envelope has a deep, elegant flap. Get a set for yourself and help bring back the stylish art of sending handwritten personal notes. Very happy with my decision to go with personalized stationery from Curio Press. Update: I discovered an incredibly small blemish on the first card I went to use. I sent a courtesy note to the shop with no expectation that they would address it, but I thought they would want to know. They immediately sent me an entirely new supply of personalized cards and envelopes. This is a company you can trust to stand behind their products and with their customers."" — Eastport Rover Get it from Amazon for $ 21.95 (available in two sizes and 20 ink and envelope colors). Curio Press is also a woman-owned and operated small business that handcrafts all of its notecards right in their small Missouri studio. Promising review: ""This simple tool is just what I needed to get dinner organized for each week. Deciding what to cook one night at a time can be stressful to me, and the added time of running to the store for the day's missing ingredients can really add up. Sometimes we would just give up and go out for dinner. This product has saved me time and money."" — minmom24 Get it from Amazon for $9.95 (available in five designs). Bloom Daily Planners is a small business with a female-led team! Promising review: ""It's made of solid aluminum, feels incredibly sturdy, and has a really sleek, minimalist design that perfectly matches my laptop. What I love most is how it raises my screen to eye level. This has made a huge difference in reducing neck and shoulder strain, especially during long work sessions."" — Jehnsy Areché Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in two sizes and 10 colors). This vacuum is only 6 pounds, so it makes carrying between rooms and floors easy and is compatible with carpets, hardwood floors, tiles, and more. Since you're used to being the ""tech expert"" for your extended family growing up in the age of technology, you'll love the LED display that shows you the charge level, suction mode, and even maintenance reminders. It runs up to 50 minutes, so you can clean your entire space! Promising review: "" I wasn’t expecting much from a vacuum this small—about the size of a Swiffer — but I’ve been seriously impressed. It’s incredibly lightweight, so carrying it up and down stairs or maneuvering around furniture is effortless. Perfect for quick cleanups, especially on hardwood and tile. Despite the compact size, the suction power is surprisingly strong. It picks up dust, crumbs, and even pet hair without a problem. The slim design gets under furniture and into tight corners where my big vacuum can’t reach. Best part? It’s super affordable. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly, no-frills vacuum for daily maintenance or small spaces, this one’s a no-brainer."" — Jess and Trish Get it from Amazon for $109.99. This tote has a detachable shoulder strap and adjustable handle to customize the fit to your preferences. Promising review: ""I’m genuinely impressed with this bag. The design is beautiful and classy, and the print gives it a chic look that stands out without being loud. It’s the perfect balance between stylish and professional. What really surprised me was the comfort. The shoulder straps are lined on the inside, which makes a huge difference; they don’t dig in or slide around, even when the bag is full. And speaking of full, I regularly carry my laptop, charger, a 3-subject college-ruled notebook, a graphing calculator, pens, and a few other odds and ends, and it never feels too heavy on my shoulder. It’s a major upgrade from a traditional backpack, looks more polished, feels more manageable, and honestly makes me feel a bit more put together walking into class or work. One small detail to note: the insert for the excess handlebar strap is only on the front side, not the back. Not a dealbreaker at all, just something to keep in mind if that matters to you. The zipper is also very durable, and it has ample pockets and storage space inside, highly recommend!"" — Hope Get it from Amazon for $34.86 (available in 10 colors). Promising review: "" Amazing bag that fits everything! Computer, clipboard, and notebook, along with my lunch bag and all other little things. Two side pockets fit my water bottles (and I have big ones, ha), and the color is perfect. Easy to carry and super durable. I pack this thing full!"" — April Get it from Amazon for $33.99 (available in two sizes and 10 colors). Promising review: ""These are microwaveable and light to carry. It’s perfect for cereal and to reheat meals in it as well. Love the colors. Wish they were available in one color only, but I can’t complain. I primarily bought these for microwave purposes. But it can be used for salads, hot soup, etc. Also, it’s an in-between size, like a medium. Just right for me."" — M. Zolnosky Get it from Amazon for $9.95. This 142-piece tool kit has everything you might need in a pinch, including a hammer, level, auto lock tape measure, pliers, precision screwdriver, hex key wrench, scissors, utility knife, and hardware kit. Promising review: ""I purchased this for my daughter as she didn’t have any tools for her new apartment. It is a very nice set that stores neatly in the case and is a space saver for those who like to keep things tidy. Includes all the basic tools needed for anyone who doesn’t have the time, money, or space for a bunch of individual tools. This would make a great gift!"" — Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $23.61 (available in two colors). Promising review: ""I absolutely love this thing! Not only is it super cute, but also super functional. It doesn’t take up much space at all and can easily fit in any of my small purses or bags, or even my back pocket. It comes with a short charger too, so I didn’t even have to buy an additional charger to keep with it. It will charge my phone easily 2–3 times before I need to recharge it. Like I said, this thing has saved me a million times over, and I let all my friends use it too!"" — Plkackert Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in four colors). This set will set your kitchen up right with two frypans, two saucepans, a griddle, and a Dutch oven for your stove, plus a solid spoon, a slotted spoon, and a slotted spatula. Promising review: ""I recently purchased this set for my first apartment, and I couldn't be happier. I knew going into these that they were not a top brand or anything that I expect to last 10 years, but after receiving them, I wouldn't be surprised if they do last that long. Overall, the set comes with almost everything you need to cook. Just add a few additional utensils and you're set. Durability: I've already run this set through the washing machine a few times, and they're still looking new. The non-stick coating isn't flaking at al,l and there is no warping. The included utensils are good quality plastic and NOT flimsy (which was a nice surprise). I actually bought a set of utensils expecting these to be junk, and now regret that purchase. So far, I haven't found any negatives to this set."" — Nick Get it from Amazon for $88.99 (available in three materials). This wallet can fit 5–12 cards, flat bills, and coins, so you no longer go digging for the card you could have sworn you had in there. Some reviews call out the appearance of marks and scratches, so be careful with your keys and coins! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this wallet. I had a similar wallet to the Ridge in the past, and it was nice, but the lack of ability to hold cash safely and without notice bothered me. This wallet doesn't require you to have a certain number of cards in it to work, and it's fairly thin. It feels high quality and fits in my pockets, any of them. Its high quality is reflected in the price, which I believe is very reasonable for something this good . No smell that I could notice. Simple open and closing, nothing fancy. I hide my big bills in the secret cash compartment, which is really nice! 10/10, you have to get this!"" — Eric K. Get it from Amazon for $89 (available in nine colors). Promising review: "" I borrowed this Béis carry-on for a six-night trip to Paris and didn’t expect to fall in love—but I did. It’s thoughtfully designed in every way: the interior compartments are smart and intuitive, the weight distribution makes it glide effortlessly, and even the handle is made from a unique, soft-touch material that feels far more premium than anything I’ve used before. Long story short: my little brother is getting a new suitcase, because I’m not giving this one back. We’ve bonded. Five stars."" — Ari N. Get it from Béis for $268 (available in 15 colors). This probably would've been useful when my friends and I scrambled and didn't know you aren't supposed to use flour to put out a grease fire... but now you know too! And while we're at it, never use water on a grease fire either. Promising review: ""Saved my house. Oil overheated and caught on fire. I had bought a two-pack and hung these blankets on the side of the cabinets. I grabbed them and smothered the fire. It was pretty intense, so it took two, and they were toast afterwards, but if they hadn't been there, I KNOW without a doubt, the whole kitchen would have caught on fire. Immediately bought a four-pack to replace. Thank you, Prepared Hero!"" — Random Reader Get it from Amazon for $25.99. This blazer is returned frequently for incorrect sizing, so be sure to read the size chart carefully. Promising review: ""I don’t even like blazers, and this completely won my heart. At first, I saw the price and thought, “That’s expensive for Amazon,” but this blazer is completely worth it. The material is nice and feels nice on. It has pockets, which is always a plus. It fits me perfectly. The material thickness is something you can wear in the winter, but not so thick that you can’t wear it in the spring. The sturdiness of the blazer is great, and it makes any outfit come together. I’m going to buy another color!""  — Brittany McKiney Get it from Amazon for $58.99 (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and 23 colors). Promising review: ""I bought these not knowing what to expect. And boy was I pleased!!!! I love these jackets. For someone who always has the worst luck finding jackets that fit me well, I felt like I won the lottery. I bought both iterations of blue, and I wear them all the time. The sleeves are tight and perfect, not the baggy kind you get with all suits. I'd sincerely recommend. Thank you, Eloquii! Wish you had more colors!"" — Pilar Get it from Eloquii for $74.99 (originally $99.95; available in women's sizes 14–32 and six color options). This one appliance can do so much in the kitchen, like pressure cook, slow cook, make rice, steam, and sauté, so you can slowly get acquainted with this new responsibility of cooking. Promising review: ""We got this pressure cooker a little over a year ago and have used it at least once a week since. It's great as a crockpot, pressure cooker, steamer, rice cooker, and anything else you could think of. I think it's right up there by the KitchenAid mixer as far as a Swiss Army Knife of the kitchen . Highly recommend!"" — johnnyjungle Get it from Amazon for $79.95+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""I've had this wine bottle opener for three years and it still works great. Opens wine bottles so quickly and easily. What a great buy! I always hated opening wine bottles the old-fashioned way with a corkscrew and was afraid of hurting myself with it. Well, this little thing has solved the problem. And it looks cool and stylish in the kitchen. Someone said theirs didn't have enough power. I'm surprised to hear that because mine has so much power and opens every single bottle beautifully. Again, have been using it for 3 years regularly and no problems so far. Plus, the price is amazing too, only around $20 or so. I even gave this wine opener to three different people, and they all loved it."" — alex Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . Promising review: ""I love my Roku. Set up is super easy. I love that I can plug it into the back of the TV for power instead of the wall for fewer cables coming down from the TV. Now only the TV's power cord is visible. Cost is great, and you get lots of free options for TV viewing. Will definitely buy another one for my other TV."" — Ms. Tara Get it from Amazon for $23.99 . Promising review: ""This has completely transformed my mornings and nights. The sunrise light alarm wakes me up gently, and I actually feel refreshed — no more jolting phone alarms! The guided meditations and sleep sounds are perfect for winding down, and I fall asleep faster than ever. The app is super easy to use and lets you fully customize your routine — from light settings to soundscapes. The device itself is sleek, quiet, and doubles as ambient lighting during the day. It’s not just an alarm clock; it’s a full sleep wellness system . If you value better rest and more mindful mornings, this is 100% worth it. Highly recommend — 5 stars!"" — Noel Get it from Amazon for $169.99 (available in seven colors). These pillows take a few days to fluff up after being removed from their vacuum sealed packaging, so be sure to wait a few days before forming your final opinion! Promising review: ""I have been buying these for years. They're the most comfortable and high quality pillow available. It's like sleeping on a cloud. We have a household of side-sleeper (me) and back-sleepers (husband and the kids), these pillows are soft but supportive for all of our needs. You'll only need one pillow, not two, and they contour to your head shape and weight. My kids are late teens so I'm not sure how these would work with smaller children. I suspect they may be too full for tiny heads."" — SarahC Get a set of two from Amazon for $59.99 (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""No break-in needed for these loafers! I’ve never been able to buy loafers because they’re either too painful, too tight, too narrow. These are perfect! I can’t believe they’re so comfortable from day one. I’ve worn them on long work days while traveling without any pain. They’re my new favorite shoes!"" — LC06 Get them from Amazon for $82.53+ (available in women's sizes 4–14 and 36 colors) or from Nordstrom for $59.93+ (available in women's sizes 4–14 and 17 colors). Promising review: ""These are really nice sturdy, yet fancy glasses. I thought I would use them for dinner parties, and I do, but I also use them for everyday. They are heavy and feel ""rich.""

Bliss Collections is a family-owned, Wisconsin-based business established in 2012 that specializes in stationery, planners, pads, and drinkware. Promising review: ""These daily planning sheets keep this mama on TRACK! I started out printing daily planning and schedule sheets from a free download on my computer. Then I realized why not just buy some already printed, so I save my ink at home. I found these and love how the day, schedule, tasks, and health habits are organized.

Promising review: ""Used for the first time today on my 7-year-old. For the first time in his life, he actually enjoyed having sunscreen applied to his skin! Very easy to use and not messy at all. Extremely pleased with this purchase!"" — amyj Get it from Amazon for $15.83+ (available in 10 colors). Promising review: ""I saw this product on TikTok and decided to try it out for myself. The name doesn’t lie — spray it on, shut the bathroom door, and in a few hours, the shower is 100 times cleaner. Usually, I’ll let it sit overnight, and by morning, the visible grime on the shower is gone, including soap scum. I’ll usually let the shower water rinse the residue out, and then take a bucket just to get everything off the shower walls. It is a bit slick if you try to get in the shower without rinsing the residue, but otherwise, it’s a worthy cleaning staple in my house."" — Tara D. Get it from Amazon for $19.98+ (available in two scents and two sizes). Promising review : ""My new favorite travel bag for makeup products. Has plenty of compartments for makeup and skincare. The middle has a little Velcro clear pocket that I use for brushes; this way, I don’t get powder/foundation all over the bag. Folds easily, holds a lot, does not take a lot of space in a bag, so you can pack it in a carry-on or backpack."" — Andra Get it from Amazon for $20.39+ (available in 29 styles and two sizes). Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans that even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. Here's what my colleague Emma Lord has to say: ""I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively."" Promising review: ""I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth — it definitely gets between the teeth and also more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft, but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!"" — Jason A. Get a pair from Amazon for $9.99 (also available as a four-pack ). Promising review : ""These are great and pretty strong. I made the mistake and tried another scent after using these, and you have no idea how much I'm still regretting it. The scent lasts long after the oil inside is done, and it hits you as soon as you open your door, without being overbearing."" — camelia virgo-evans Get a pack of four from Amazon for $12.88 (available in three scents and five pack sizes) Here's why BuzzFeed Shopping writer AnaMaria Glavan loves this: "" The glove is super comfortable and using it couldn’t be more foolproof: just put it on and run your hands through your pet’s fur. That’s it! The silicone grooves pick up so much fur with ease. Like, my dog looks close to hairless. HOW is he shedding so much!?!? After a few runs, I found that I would have to remove fur from the glove before continuing (you can pick up the fur with your other hand or run the glove under some water — either works), but it’s no biggie. The silicone actually makes it really easy to keep this clean. We got Rockie when he was five, and he’d been riddled with skin issues and allergies, so I was pretty nervous to use anything that could potentially aggravate his conditions. However! Not only does this *not* bother his skin, but he…loves this. A lot. He starts snoring after exactly two run-throughs on his back. Also, his coat looks SO shiny after each use! TL;DR: This is one of those inexpensive add-ons that any pet owner should have on hand. "" Get it from Amazon for $9.49 . Each box lasts two months! Promising review: ""For anyone who might be a skeptic, please allow me to put you at ease. If you have hyperhidrosis, meaning it can be 9 degrees outside and you're still sweating under your arms, this product has the potential to change your life. I would sweat THROUGH a sport coat before noon. Enter the Sweat Block product. I've had it for three weeks, and it is life-changing. I DO NOT sweat under my arms anymore. I'm still on the original box that I bought three weeks ago. I had to write a review after I was cleaning the garage today in 85-degree heat...I was sweating through my shirt on my back...BUT NOT MY UNDERARMS. It is amazing!"" — Frosty McGee Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $19.99+ (also available in packs of two or three boxes). The 4-in-1 model comes with two chopping blades (one with small cubes and one with larger cubes) and two spiralizer blades (a julienne cutter and a ribbon cutter). You'll also receive a finger guard, two cleaning brushes, and two cleaning scrapers. All pieces are dishwasher-safe! Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. This requires very little effort to cut through the food, and it has a generous container."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29.97+ (available in six styles and five colors). Promising review: "" I purchased this candle warmer for myself a little over a year ago. Since then, I have purchased one for my mom and grandma. This candle warmer is gorgeous. Timeless. High Quality. And although I haven't had to change the bulb yet, I'm pleased it comes with a spare :) well worth it!!!"" — Justine Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in 13 various colors and styles). It has three different steam modes: light for small messes, normal for everyday grime, and deep for the eyesore stains you may have neglected. Promising review: ""I love this scrub mop. I had been looking for a mop to up my cleaning game, but I wanted something that was easy to use, free of chemicals, and actually made cleaning quick and easy. As a mom of three kids under the age of six, this last one was essential. I’m so impressed with how quick and easy it is to clean with this thing. I wish I had this when the kids were younger and spills and accidents were more frequent."" — Samantha Forster Get it from Amazon for $119.99+ (available in five styles). Promising review: ""We retired to the Southwest US, which is just a huge dust bowl. I didn’t want to be breathing in the dust, and I absolutely hate to dust furniture. So I researched air purifiers and chose this model. In order to filter dust, it seems I needed a HEPA filter, which this purifier uses. While not washable, they are able to be vacuumed, which I do about once a week, so they last longer. Overall, the price for the purifier and the filters was less for this model than others I researched. I bought the large model of this purifier for the main room of our 1200 sf Townhouse, and it works really well. I only have to dust every 3-4 weeks, which suits me just fine. I think the purifier is about as loud as a white noise machine, so not very loud in my opinion. My husband, who wears hearing aids, finds it noisier than I do. I bought 2 of the smaller version of this same purifier for the 2 bedrooms. While they are just a smaller version of this machine they don’t work nearly as well. It gets dusty in those rooms within days. I wish I had purchased the larger version for those rooms too. I’ve had all three purifiers going 24/7 for four months now, and the filters are nowhere near the point where they need changing, again noting that I vacuum them weekly. So all in all, these purifiers have been very economical to use. "" — SuesZoo Promising review: ""I was skeptical any air purifier at this price could do much, but I tried it! I have a medium-sized music room for record collections and playing those records, etc. The room is about 18 x 18. I hate dealing with dust getting on the records and equipment. I took note of some dark items with dust on them first. Then, I cleaned those items to see if they would stay clean because it usually takes a few days to be covered again. I ran the Levoit at medium speed for two weeks solid, and those surfaces look just as clean as when I cleaned them. Does it work? Yes, it does! The lowest setting is pretty quiet, but the medium and high can be fairly loud. I turn it off during listening times."" — Charles Tweedy Get a purifier that can cover up to 1095 st. ft spaces from Amazon for $99.99+ (available in black and white, plus a WiFi-enabled version). You can also get a mini size for up to 240 sq ft. for $49.99 . It'll also nourish your skin thanks to its hyaluronic acid and shea butter formula. Plus, reviewers say they like this *more* than Smashbox's Becca under-eye cream because it's thinner, doesn't settle into fine lines, and is better at brightening. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" — Placeholder Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). Read more about how temperature therapy can help with migraine prevention at Mayo Clinic . Promising review: ""I heard about it on TikTok, and I was skeptical. I put it in the freezer as soon as I got it in the mail. Then, out of nowhere, I felt a headache coming on . I pulled it out of the freezer, slipped it on, and passed out. When I woke up, my migraine was gone . I now go to bed with it on almost every night. I love that it's a blackout mask. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"" — TheWalkFam Get it from Amazon for $27.95+ (available in five colors and two-packs). Meowy Janes is a small business based in New Egypt, New Jersey. It specializes in catnip and catnip alternatives. BuzzFeed editor Chelsea Stuart loves these...or...her cats do: I recently tried some of these out with my cats and they were a hit! TBH, they've never really been super into catnip — they'll play with it, but they don't go wild — so I was excited to see they were into these. They bat them around, rub their faces all over them, and ultimately, when they're done, hide them under a chair or in their cat condo so they can come back to them later."" Promising review: ""The second I put a stick down our kitty was obsessed! Our cat loves 'chewing' so these are a great fit for him. All natural, great packaging, and quick shipping! Thank you."" — kr323 Get 7–9 chews from Amazon for $10.99 or from Meowy Janes on Etsy for $13.61 . This works with your existing luggage, unlike versions of this that come pre-built into more expensive suitcases! Promising review: ""I was able to pack seven outfits and have way more space in this organizer. I just packed the clothes in the organizer, closed it up, and placed it in my carry-on. Once I got to the hotel, I just hung it in my closet. It would be perfect for cruises since there is never any drawer space and very little room to move around."" — jess Get it from Amazon for $26.81+ (available in nine colors, two sizes, and several sets). Promising review: ""SNAIL SLIME?! ON MY FACE?! EW! That's what you might be thinking, but in reality, this product is AMAZING. I've been using this product for about a month, and shortly after it arrived, I had a bit of an acne breakout. Well, one zit was a painful little bugger, and it finally came to the surface. It popped and left a big, nasty red spot. After using the Advanced Snail 96 essence before bed, I woke up the next morning, and the red mark was significantly less irritated-looking . This doesn't make my acne scars and marks disappear, but it really helps reduce the redness and irritation of fresh acne marks. It is very hydrating, and a little goes a long way! Plus, I find the slimy-ness of it to be strangely entertaining."" — Cat Promising review: ""I'm a 60-year-old with sun damage, and it is absolutely living up to the hype. I am not big on expensive and extensive skincare routines, but I started with this product about three weeks ago, and my skin is transformed. My face is so soft and radiant, I actually ordered the toner and moisturizer, which will arrive on Tuesday. I give this a top rating."" — Working Musician Get it from Amazon for $16.98 . It has five speeds, five massager heads, and a travel case, so you can always get deep-muscle treatment all over your body — even when you're at the gym! Plus, reviewers say they prefer the lowest setting of the Renpho compared to the Theragun because it's gentler! Read more about what massage guns can (and can’t) do, plus how to use them, at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""We had a Theragun , and the lowest setting was so rough. Rarely used it. The Renpho massager is so much nicer, and we use it all the time! The changeable knobs are wonderful to target different areas. The handle has a really nice feel to its size and material. We have had it for over a month, and it still has three out of four charge bars. We use it every few days for 5–15 minutes. Love the case too! Really such a great buy."" — Murphtime Get it from Amazon for $89.99 . This is a mildly abrasive cleaning paste, so use with care and go slowly when testing on new surfaces. Simply apply it to the surface with a damp sponge or cloth, give it a few scrubs, and then rinse away with hot water. Promising review: ""I used this product for my stove because if there's one thing I dislike, it's cleaning. I have used multiple degreaser sprays, and they all are so toxic and don't work for me. But this product, oh my goodness, is legit a miracle. It doesn't have any smell. I put the paste on a cloth, clean the area, then wipe it off with a damp cloth, and voilà — magic !"" — May Get it from Amazon for $5.97 (also available in a bundle with a scrubber sponge). It's also easy to clean: Just twist and unlock the roller's ring, gently pull out the stone part, wash the stone with a gentle cleanser, rinse it off, and let it air dry before using it again! Promising review: ""I was shocked! This actually works. It takes the oil away without distributing the makeup . Game changer for me. I don’t know why I didn’t know about this sooner."" — Lesa A. Get it from Amazon for $7.98 . ErgoDriven is a US-based small business specializing in workplace ergonomics. Promising review : ""Really nice mat, helps with leg and back fatigue. I stand up 50 percent of the time at my desk, and I can feel the difference in the two weeks I've had this product. It seems to have the right balance of comfort and support. It is a little pricey compared to other brands, but it is very solidly made, and it appears it will last a long time. Worth the extra money, in my opinion."" — Jeff Get it from Amazon for $119+ (available in three colors). Psst — you can check out a mini version for more compact spaces for $79+ on Amazon! BTW, this is cruelty-free! It's suitable for all hair types, too. Get a look at how it's used on TikTok . Promising review: ""I can finally skip a day or two between washes!! I’ve tried so many dry shampoos, from drug store to salon and none of them really worked for me. I can apply this product very sparingly along my part and easily skip a shampoo without being self-conscious or having an itchy scalp. Must have for oily hair ."" — Dino Get it from Amazon for $12.59+ (available in seven shades and in multipacks). Make sure to first wash your face with your favorite cleanser and one of the *included* silicone heads, using the ""Cleaning"" and ""Ion+"" mode. Then, with your skin still being wet, switch to ""Lifting"" mode and glide the stainless steel spatula over your face at a 45-degree angle to lift up the gunk in your pores. Afterwards, use the ""Ion-"" mode after applying your favorite skincare products so you can maximize the benefits! Btw, each mode automatically turns off after five minutes so you don't overuse it! See it in action on TikTok ! BuzzFeed Shopping writer Negesti Kaudo uses this : ""I got a facial a couple of years ago and I could tell something was different about my extractions, so I asked the aesthetician to write down the name of the product. I went home and immediately bought this! I LOVE IT. I love it more than any other skincare tool that I own. This thing gets gunk out like nothing I've ever tried before, and the first time I used it, I was absolutely disgusted. But I kept on using it. I don't have much acne, but I do have oily combination skin and visibly clogged pores, so this has been a lifesaver when I don't have time to visit an aesthetician. You have to use it while your face is still wet, so after washing your face or even using toner, and you just start scraping. Make sure you have a paper towel near (and maybe a camera) because you will be amazed and disgusted all at once, but you will literally never stop using. I use mine every other day to once a week if I'm having skincare issues, but it also does a great job with monthly use (it's just much grosser)! I follow mine up with Clinique's Clarifying Lotion 3 and Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel !"" Promising review: ""Don't doubt it, a staple in skincare. I got this little device from a TikTok and decided to give it a try. I never knew I needed it until the first time I tried it. The vibrations magically bring up all the stubborn blackheads you can’t reach with just your fingers, especially if you have acrylics like me. "" — Paige Chaney Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in three colors). Just swish a capful for a minute and gargle for 30 seconds after you're done brushing your teeth in the morning and night. Promising review: ""I'm actually a dentist who often has bad breath, which is not a good combination. My oral hygiene is great (tongue scraping, brushing, flossing, etc.), but I have allergies and constantly have a bit of post-nasal drip, which contributes to the bad breath. While this stuff isn't perfect, and my breath doesn't stay fresh all day, it is definitely the longest-lasting product I have tried so far. It is the first thing I have tried that still gives me that minty feeling when I breathe deeply 4–6 hours after using it. Will definitely be buying again."" — Alex Get a two-pack from Amazon for $15.34 (also available in mild mint ). And if you need more convincing, check out our in-depth review of TheraBreath oral rinse ! One reviewer said a small bag was able to fit six t-shirts, seven pairs of shorts, and four boxers! So, a set of these will easily fit your week's worth of clothing at that rate. Here's what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord says: ""HELLO, I AM OBSESSED WITH THESE. Despite all the rave reviews, I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion, I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly, all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and made a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips needed them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again — these are worth every damn penny. "" Promising review: ""I travel monthly for work, usually gone for 4–5 days. Before these, I would have to check a bag. Dress shirts and pants, roll up nicely, and stay wrinkle-free. It's tempting to want to over-stuff these, but if you're packing golf shirts or clothes with 'slippery' fabric, they slide out of the top of the bag as you get close to the end. The clips take a minute to get used to, but after a couple of times zipping up the bags, it's pretty easy."" — BigSkinny Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.98 . Promising review: ""Love love love this product. Simple design, works great. I time myself during writing sessions so I'm not sitting in long stretches. This little timer is perfectly shaped and has several pre-programmed time options. Highly recommend."" — Mimi Foster Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in three colors). PSA: *ONLY* use ice packs (aka ice is a no-no) for up to eight hours and do not leave perishable food in it without ice packs for more than two hours in a vehicle over 85 degrees F. Promising review: ""Have had this bag for about 5 years now and used it for numerous road trips. We fill the main compartment up with snacks and the pockets with a few activities, like car trip scavenger hunt cards. It's still going strong and plan to use it for an upcoming summer vacation. We do whatever we can to keep our young son content on days-long road trips and he likes to be able to access his own snacks and have an extra place to store his things. Part of the excitement of upcoming trips is filling this bin with road trip goodies that he normally wouldn't have access to."" — lady.k Get it from Amazon for $44.99 . It couldn't be easier to use — just dip the included brush in water, apply the cleaning solution to the shoe, then brush and wipe away! Promising review: ""I have had my Nike Roshe runs for about a year now, and I don't go easy on them. I play sports and run in the dirt with them all the time, but I also like to wear them for fashion purposes. Pink Miracle helped restore my daily shoes to look like I just bought them — now I can wear them for even longer. Very pleased with Pink Miracle, I will buy it again when I run out of my bottle."" — Romario Get it from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in three sizes). Promising review : ""I saw this on TikTok and wanted to get it. I wear glasses every day and often don't realize how dirty they are until I see a reflection through them. I've used cloths before but they get weirdly oily and then leave smear marks. This does not. I love it so much and I don't lose it in my purse."" — Clair F Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in 21 styles). Check out why BuzzFeed Shopping editor Sally Elshorafa loves these: ""This product SAVED MY SHOES in my old apartment! I had an awkward set of built-in shelves in my closet, and it was the only place I wanted to put my shoes. As you can see from the before pic (above), it was a big mess; my shoes were piled on top of each other and getting really dirty. Traditional shoe caddies or boxes didn't really work because there's not much horizontal space, so I tried the Shoe Slotz . It fixed the problem perfectly! Because the design smartly stacks one shoe on top of the other, you save 50% of the space you'd normally use to store your shoes."" Get a 10-piece set from Amazon for $34.99 (also available in a 20- and 40-pack). Promising review: "" This foot peel is THE TRUTH and got my feet right and smooth as butter! I’ve never done a foot peel in my life, and so I had a lot of hard skin under my foot to get rid of. I followed the instructions on the box, and decided to put on the foot peel on right before bed. You can feel the peel tingling and working while you have it on your feet so I felt relief. It took about three days after I did the peel to see the results starting. Do not get discouraged if you see peeling only at the toes. That’s just the start of it...cause the next day I felt the mid of my foot arch bubble after my bath and a whole piece of skin was peeling. This peel did its job and some more! It has my feet feeling baby smooth and gave me a feeling of being in a salon without the polish. It felt good to pamper myself. This is my go-to from now on, when I want a good smooth foot AFTER a pedicure (because a pumice stone can’t do what this peel can)!"" — Shopinista Get a pack of two from Amazon for $19.99 (available in five scents). Double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the gunk out of your pores. Promising review: ""This product is incredible. After one use, I noticed a difference. I am so impressed with it. I don’t know what kind of sorcery this is, but I am happy it exists. If you’ve been buying products to get rid of blackheads and nothing is working, this will make you very happy."" — A Promising review: ""I can't live without this cleansing oil; it's magic in a bottle. this is the only thing that's been able to clear the sebaceous filaments on my nose after consistent use daily!! it also helps the milia/filaments under my eyes! LOVE ITTTTT WHO LET ME LEAVE THE HOUSE WITHOUT DOUBLE CLEANSING AT NIGHT"" — Sarah Coleman Get it from Amazon for $17.69 .

Promising reviews: ""Plants are thriving! It brought one back from the brink of death. Easy peasy."" — jasmin "" Must-have for all houseplants! It's the best plant food! I use these for all of my houseplants — I have around 30 or so. Super easy to use and works perfectly for all my plants. Definitely worth the buy!"" — Kala H. "" As soon as I inserted a few of these in each of my vegetable plant, my garden took off from there. This is the only product that I use. Now I am actively growing and eating from my vegetable garden thanks to this product."" — Kia Get a two-pack (with 48 spikes each) from Amazon for $9.95 . Made with a bamboo handle and powder-coated steel, it uses a simple lever system to make weeding easy. Grampa's Gardenware Co. is a small, family-owned business based in Oregon making tools for gardening. They've been making this tool since 1913! Promising review: ""I love gardening, but I’m getting older now and weeding is backbreaking work…until I bought this product. It works like a charm, it grabs onto the rootstock, and you simply leverage it out of the ground, root and all. The other end of the lever works well too, like the claw of a hammer; it grabs onto smaller weeds and lifts them out of the ground. Now I can weed a large area in less than half the time without breaking my back…👍"" — Michael D. Kutras Get it from Amazon for $39.97 . Promising review: "" I've been searching for something to remove the weeds for a while and came across this amazing tool. Since I refuse to use chemicals in my yard, I've been left with scraped knuckles every time I attempt to remove weeds. The weeds have grown so tightly in the concrete cracks that I pretty much gave up; even weed-whacking it didn't help much. Yes, you do have to use a little bit of effort, but the end result was so worth it! "" — Shelley Arakaki Get it from Amazon for $15.95 . The reviewer who shared their before and after pics above said they have an autoimmune disease that makes pulling overgrown weeds tough — but with this handy tool, they were able to clear the 6-foot weeds from their garden bed! Promising review: ""This tool is awesome and it lasts a long time for trimming around your plants. I love it and recommend it for anyone who needs to trim around their plants and/or vegetable trees. Mine is a banana tree and was not kept trimmed around it, but after getting this tool, I'm able to trim around without damaging or making a mess around it."" — IC Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""Love this product for so many reasons. The raised design keeps our dogs and nature friends out of the garden. It's great for elderly and people with back or knee problems. You can still garden. Easy to put together. We got a 4-foot garden. Possibly overloaded it, but we have four tomato plants, three eggplants, three green peppers, three red peppers, and three strawberries. Highly recommend."" — Cybil Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in three sizes and three finishes). Promising review: ""I ordered the raised flower bed because I just couldn't prep my hard ground for a garden. It arrived a week sooner than it said it would be here, and it took me about 20 minutes to put it together. It saved me hours of unnecessary work, and my garden looks great ."" — Christine Hanaki Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in five sizes and five colors). Promising review: ""Love this little pollinator house! I wasn’t sure it was attracting them at first, but the next time I looked, a bunch of the tubes were sealed off. The bees seem happy, and my garden is doing great."" — Jenna Preston Get it from Amazon for $12.08+ (available in two colors). BTW, Created by Nature is a small business! Promising review: ""Planted a handful of the seeds in our front lawn area. A few months later, we had a spectacular color array. Great flowers!"" — Shane Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Seed Needs is a family-owned small business in Michigan that makes seed packets. Promising review : ""I bought this package hoping to attract butterflies. It did not disappoint. I have the opposite of a green thumb, and this was super easy. I couldn't tell you the names of any flowers, but we have at least six different types. I overseeded a smaller area, so I will probably make the area larger or only do half the seeds next year. We can go outside at any time and see our beautiful flowers and SO many butterflies! 10/10"" — Tesa Taylor Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in four mixes and two sizes). The photos above show that the meter gave the same results as a separate pH test the reviewer took with their soil (between a 6 and 6.5). This meter has a single-probe design (aka less danger to your precious plant roots!) that must be inserted at least 2.5 inches into the soil. No batteries are required! Promising review: ""This little gizmo surprised me. My vegetable garden wasn’t going too well. My wife said it needed more water; I said it needed more fertilizer. It turns out, we were both right. After seeing the readings on the Raintrip, I adjusted both. Now the garden is producing like wild! It requires no batteries and, as long as you keep it clean, it’s as accurate as can be. It’s a tiny investment to find out soil acidity/alkalinity, moisture, nutrients and light levels. I wish I had this years ago! Simple to use, well packaged and easy to read. Seriously, this makes me look like I know what I’m doing."" — Jimbo Get it from Amazon for $15.99 . Promising review: ""Holy cow these suckers work! I'm so grossed out by the result, but at the same time, I have a sick sense of satisfaction. I used these in my houseplants that are breeding fungus gnats. I used them in conjunction with beneficial nematodes, and they definitely cut down on the number of gnats in our house. Unfortunately, I added a new houseplant, plus repotted one that had outgrown its prior home, and we are wrapped up in them again. I'm buying another package of sticky traps as soon as I finish this review!"" — Megan Get a pack of 16 traps (with eight stakes) from Amazon for $6.99 . It also comes with a measuring stick called a dibbler that pushes down the dirt to the correct depth for you to drop your seeds. The holes are color-coded to let you know exactly where to plant seeds of different varieties. Promising review: ""Love this thing! I have been gardening for a while, and this takes all of the guesswork out of spacing . I used this for the first time this spring using the planting chart/guide, and it has worked out perfectly. I have had little to no weeds (I mean, come on, you're gonna get some weeds). Planting per the Seed Square will, for the most part, choke out the weeds, while promoting growth for the plants. I even used this to plant growing plants, and not just seeds. Just put the square on the ground, used the stick to mark the spot, and dug a hole where it was marked. Simple enough. Would highly recommend. Super easy!"" — Jennifer Geisel Get it from Amazon for $29.95 . Gardinnovations is a Bridgewater, New Jersey-based small biz that specializes in gardening tools and accessories. Promising review: ""Okay, I'm a gadget fan, and this is a GREAT gadget. At 17 inches long, it works for any kind of in ground, container, or raised bed. Good weight, sturdy. Gives nice, straight, easy-to-space rows. The points are 1 inch apart. Nice spacing for easy thinning, or just seed every second or third or fourth divot depending on what you are planting. For those who think it might be too deep, easy enough to adjust that for your needs. Have personally found that even lettuces come up stronger for slightly deeper than recommended planting depth, then again, live in the hot dry desert. All in all, a great idea and good quality tool."" — Candace Delaney Get it from Gardinnovations on Etsy for $26.95 . Truly Garden is a US-based, veteran-owned small business, and they offer a five-year warranty with this knife! Promising review: ""I rarely leave a review unless I think something is truly an excellent product. This is the BEST hori hori I've ever owned! I've owned several during the last 20 years, and this one stands the test of time. I'm not always easy on some of my gardening tools; this knife has routinely been left outside in the dirt, rain, or shine. It's still in excellent shape after seven long years. I decided to buy a second one for my greenhouse. It's comfortable in the hand, strong enough to cut roots with the serrated edge, and long enough to use for planting bulbs, prying up weeds, and digging holes for 6-inch pots. If you only buy one tool, this is it."" — nancy thompson Get it from Amazon for $31.95+ (available in two styles). Promising review: ""These really do work! We had a big ant infestation in the garden, with four separate nests. I was worried about using these with the dogs in the yard, so the night before we left on a week's vacation, we set up about 10 of these traps, putting them right beside the nests. As soon as we got home, we picked up all the traps (ALL the bait was gone) so the dogs could not get to them, and we noticed that all of the nests were no longer active. It WORKED. We now put them outside our fence line so the dogs can't get to them, and it seemed to keep the ants out of the yard all summer. My only issue is that they can get messy. You have to be sure to hold them straight up after you clip off the tab and open the trap, otherwise, the liquid bait inside will spill out."" — pboy Get a pack of 12 from Amazon for $12.68 . Here's how it works: Find a node and peel away the bract to reveal the bud. Apply a small amount of the paste, and in two to eight weeks, a clone will grow out of the node! Check out the TikTok about this paste for more deets. Promising review: ""This product is just AMAZING!!! I waited a few months before writing this review because I wanted to test the product first. I am just AMAZED! I have to say...depending on the season and the place on the spike where you apply it, you either get a keiki or new flower spike (which is awesome!). Based on my experiments, the lower on the spike, the more chances to get a keiki. The higher on the spike, the more chances to get a new flower spike. If you apply it during winter (tropical area winter), you will more likely get flower spikes. If you apply it during summer (tropical areas), you will more likely get a keiki — at least that's what I observed!"" — Anne-Isabelle Bonifassi Get it from Amazon for $18.99 . This non-toxic fly bait attracts flies from a distance of 30-40 feet, and you'll want to position it at least 20 feet away from where you'll be most of the time, as the smell is *not* pleasant for humans. Promising review: ""Great product. In the first few days, I saw more flies in my life than I have ever seen in my garden ever. After a couple of days, the water in the bag started turning black, and hundreds of dead flies in there. Originally, I got this product because I have a lime tree that flies lay eggs in the soil. After a couple of days, I don’t see any more flies emerging from the soil. Smells like week-old fish market but a great product, does exactly what it's advertised."" — Chris Get a pack of two from Amazon for $14.09 (also available in a pack of four). Promising review: "" I have bought this twice and am ordering my third bottle now. We live in Maryland, north of DC, and behind a wooded preserve with a high population of deer who are brazen in their approach to eating vegetation. This has saved my hydrangeas, sedum, and even my gorgeous gigantic mums bought from Costco, all of which had been devoured by the deer until I found this product. I put it on once a month. The smell is strong but not offensive."" — KSwan Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (also available in larger sizes and packs). The timer function has three options: 4 hours, 8 hours, or 12 hours — and it follows a 24-hour cycle, so you can set it to turn on for eight hours every day, for example. Promising review : "" My favorite time of year is starting seeds for our vegetable garden. I previously relied on sunlight from our windows, but decided to try a grow light this year. Our germination rate since using those grow lights has dramatically improved. I love how the light has different brightness settings and can also be set to a timer. It's also so easy to use that my elementary-aged children turn it on every morning and set the timer as one of their chores. Since it is flexible and stays in place well, I'm able to direct light to two different trays on separate shelves with just this one light. Excellent grow light! Would make a great gift for any gardener!"" — Melissa Get it from Amazon for $19.19+ (available in two wattage levels). Note: As the reviewer below mentions, this doesn't come with hoops to hold the cover up, so be sure to pick those up if needed. Promising review: ""Overall an excellent product! The material is breathable enough to let airflow and sunlight through. It protected my plants during the rare snow storm in southeast Texas . I purchased hoops to keep the blanket off my plants to keep the foliage safe from any freeze damage. This isn’t going to protect your foliage unless you keep the fabric off the plant. But it will protect the root system even if used without hoops. If you leave the cloth with snow on it resting on your plant’s foliage, it’s like leaving an ice pack on the foliage for hours/days; you will get foliage damage. Purchase hoops to prevent that from happening. I hope this helps!"" — FCaballero Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in four sizes). These help protect them against bad weather as well! Promising review: ""Love the size of these nets. I'm trying my hand at growing tomatoes in pots this year. My friends have told me about their issues with birds, critters, and insects, and these nets seem perfect. They fit perfectly over the cages, and I particularly like the drawstring on the bottom to safeguard against any invaders. There's no problem watering the plants through the net, and plenty of sun and air get through. "" — DC Get a pack of two from Amazon for $11.99 (available in four sizes and various packs). Promising review: ""This tray is sturdy and the perfect size for new gardeners or for gardeners who have a smaller garden. Even established gardeners can take advantage of this space-saving tray. Seeds all grow at different rates, and you should be planting the seeds at the right time so they are ready to transplant outside. Once you plant the seeds, you should not take the dome off until about 50% of seeds have germinated or popped through the soil. You also shouldn’t have to water again, if you watered properly when planting, until those sprouts pop out. So this means that anything you plant in a tray should all be expected to pop through the soil at about the same time or you run the risk of overwatering or removing the dome too soon. These smaller trays will help solve all those problems and make things much easier for you. It makes planting the seeds more manageable ."" — Lexi Get it from Amazon for $16.99 (available in two sizes). Promising review: "" I balked at first at how pricey this was, but now I can say it was worth it. I fill it once a week, added some dry twigs and leaves from sweeping the driveway, added a little water, and I've got the start of some really rich soil nutrients. Don't believe the reviews that say you'll have good compost after one month. I've owned this since the beginning of summer (it's now almost fall), live in Denver where the unit gets really hot, and I'm just now getting some good stuff out of the unit. I turn it three full revolutions once a week after adding kitchen waste, and that's it. I feel good knowing I'm being environmentally friendly while creating great nutrients for my smallish herb and flower garden. The unit is attractive — pretty unobtrusive — so don't worry about it making your yard look ugly. It's the best-looking one I found. If you're serious about composting but don't want to work too hard at it, and don't want to spend hours putting together a cheaper unit, this one's for you."" — Yvie Get it from Amazon for $349.99+ (available in two colors and two sizes). Promising review: ""Where have these been all my life?! I have always grown herbs and had a garden the traditional way (in pots or in a garden bed). I love these because my husband and I travel a lot, so we're able to hook these babies up to a water source and timer...and voila!!!! Plants are stayin' alive! I bought three panels, but am going to order more and do a whole wall of the house."" — Yee Jensen Get one panel from Amazon for $79 . Mr. Stacky is a small business that makes vertical plant growing products. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this! I have used it to plant strawberries, lemon balm, English ivy, creeping Jenny, cauliflower on top, lavender, oregano, and parsley. It hooks together easily, and it can be taken apart if you have to move it. It normally stays outside; however, we are having a winter freeze right now, so I had to bring it in. I am constantly sending the link to my friends and family because they love it also."" — Cynthia Stoker Get it from Amazon for $36.95 (available in more colors and sizes on their store page , including the pink one shown above). Promising review: ""We bought the bags to try growing vegetables, herbs, and fruit (tomatoes). We travel full-time so the ease of transportation is terrific. Using new potting soil, and so far, all the plants have grown and produced well. The bags are holding up, and we plan on using them next year."" — Paula Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in three sizes and multiple packs). The AeroGarden Sprout comes with a free seed kit to get you started with three herbs (Genovese basil, curly parsley, and dill). You can also pick up one of AeroGarden's Grow Anything kits if you want to use your own seeds in the future! If you're interested in growing more, there are a variety of AeroGardens in bigger sizes as well as seed kits that let you grow cherry tomatoes, petunias, salad greens, and more. P romising review : ""I have three of the AeroGardens in different sizes. This size is perfect for herbs you use all the time . The compact size fits anywhere. The system comes with fertilizer. You fill the reservoir, add the fertilizer, put the pods in, and plug it in. The timer for the correct amount of light is preset, so make sure you put the unit in a place where the light won’t bother you. It also reminds you to add fertilizer. Once the plant is hardy enough, you can plant in soil or leave it on your counter in water. I love it!"" — Nicki Get it from Amazon for $44 . Promising review: ""Love it! Looks beautiful at night, and guests love them! Planning on ordering more soon! Works in all weather, rain, snow, heat! Just need sunlight! Only con is probably not a con, but they only stay lit at night for approximately two and a half hours. That’s fine because we head to bed, so it’s perfect for us! Highly recommended!"" — Damon R. Jackson Get a six-pack from Amazon for $39.99 (also available in a 10-pack). Promising review: ""I am totally obsessed with these lights. I bought my first set and had them for about a week and couldn’t get over how lovely they were. So I have now purchased two more sets. They light up my flowers and azalea bushes beautifully. They have a lovely orange glow like little fireflies."" — A Lombardo Get a two-pack from Amazon for $14.98 (also available in larger packs). Promising review: ""Bought this for my dad whose back gets to barking picking up the thousands of sweet gum balls...pokey balls as we call 'em. He's used it a few times now and says it definitely helps his back and doesn't take too much extra time , if any, than doing it by hand. He says you do have to play around a little bit to get used to adjusting the head around as you're picking them up, so you can fit as many as possible in the fingers before emptying. But it doesn't take long to get the hang of it. It works picking up from rocks (without picking up the rocks) and in grass, as well as hard surfaces. Although these aren't the cheapest items to purchase and don't replace the shoveling of large piles, they do seem to work as advertised when going around picking up the random scattered ones if you can't shell out the $$$ for the larger machines this company makes."" — Eric Get it from Amazon for $64.99 (also available with a collection bag). Promising review: ""I’ve used these for years on my tomatoes, cucumbers, and cantaloupe that are trellised. They provide great support, are easy to apply, and will hold all year long. I’ve tried several other types and keep coming back to this."" — Jem Get it from Amazon for $5.90+ (available in five sizes).

I was a bit skeptical at first but finally got around to trying it. First off, this scent smells amazing! Almost every time I've worn it, I receive compliments. It has a sweet smell, almost like warm cake or sugar cookies with a hint of lemon . With such an affordable price, I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about trying it."" — Chrissy Get it from Amazon for $4.50 (available in two styles). I bought these on Prime Day, which is the only day I will buy leggings because I hate wearing leggings with a burning passion. My ""I'm not like other girls"" bit is that for some reason I am always comfier in jeans than leggings. BUT NOT THESE!!! They slide on. The fabric is so lightweight and breathable that it feels like a whisper. The band is so deceptively comfortable that sometimes I'm like, ""Am I still wearing them??"" I use them to run outdoors because that is the only circumstance I'll wear a legging, and I'm happy to report after several washes, they are durable and compressive enough to withstand workouts. They would be excellent for lounging if I weren't wired in this odd anti-legging way. I have already bought two more pairs and made my friends buy them, too. Promising review: ""Super comfy. I usually don’t write reviews, I tried this first before buying Lulu, and these are the most comfortable leggings for every day and even for workouts. Highly recommended!"" — Criselle Johnson Get them from Amazon for $29+ (available in women's sizes XXS–XXL, two inseams, and 22 styles). See what BuzzFeed Writer Emma Lord has to say about this: "" I bought this after being peer-pressured by all the lovely reviews and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype. The scent is lovely — it has depth with a hint of floral, but it's light and not at all overpowering . My favorite thing about it is how easily it pairs other scents, because I am a body mist gremlin who swaps out her scents every day. The lather is also deeply satisfying and I feel quite refreshed and squeaky clean without ever feeling dry."" Promising review: ""Cremo's body wash is nothing short of exceptional. If you’re a fan of luxurious fragrances, this product will quickly become your new favorite. It boasts an incredible scent that perfectly mimics Baccarat Rouge 540 — a fragrance renowned for its sophisticated and captivating aroma. What sets this body wash apart is not just its stunning scent but also its longevity. The fragrance lingers beautifully throughout the day , ensuring you stay enveloped in that luxurious aroma long after your shower."" — Ralph D.

Promising review : ""I was really debating buying the $95 one but figured I spent enough on the bag, so I decided to just get a replica for the cherry. I’m so glad I did! It looks almost exactly like it except for the slight change in hardware color. The quality seems great, and it looks sturdy. I love it! It really gives the bag an extra nice touch."" — Oriana Pineda Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in two colors). Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bag!! I needed something to use when I’m traveling, especially for when I go to trade shows and meetings. I’ve always lugged my backpack everywhere and finally got fed up with it on a trip this past week. I also wanted something that was sophisticated looking and had a full zipper. I love the material because it’s easy to clean. It looks almost exactly like the Longchamp bag, too, which is the main reason why I got it. I’ve actually been using it daily by putting my small purse in it and am able to put other things in it as well (small jacket, water bottle, small reusable bag, etc. ) It has two inner pockets, which are near the top of the bag. One is zipped, and one isn’t. It stays on my shoulder and doesn’t slip off, unlike other bags I’ve had . I’m curious to see how well it holds and for how long, but so far I’m very impressed and very happy with the quality!"" — Kelsey Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in four colors). Promising reviews: ""It’s much more spacious than it looks. It’s very sleek and stylish. I use it as my work bag and find that it looks professional and has enough space for all of my stuff. I carry a laptop, pencil case, two books, makeup bag, water bottle, wallet, lotion, phone and laptop chargers, and other small miscellaneous objects . Still plenty of space. And when you carry it, it doesn’t feel bulky or cumbersome."" — Su ""I had purchased the Béis bag in the past and have gone through four of them in one year.

Promising review: ""RUN. Don't walk. I never write reviews but legit as soon as I put this on, I knew I had to share with the world. So surprisingly thick (no fear of see-through) and stretchy. The ribbed texture is fun and gives that extra snatch effect."" — bmg Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and 10 colors). This is designed to work on all hair types, with reviewers with 2b–4c curls mentioning it worked for them! Promising review: ""Like many others, I tried this as a replacement for Olaplex. Honestly, Olaplex never had a great effect on my hair and certainly wasn’t worth the price. This did an unreal job on my hair!! I was skeptical (tried a little bit first because I was petrified it would burn off my hair and I would end up bald!) but lo and behold, it was magic! My hair is so strong, silky, and healthy looking after just one use. Plus, you can’t beat the price! Have already ordered another box. I should also add I have curly/wavy hair that’s been colored to a light brown. Buy it!!"" — BB Check out BuzzFeed's full review of the Elizavecca hair treatment for more deets! Get a bottle from Amazon for $7.60 . Promising review: ""I think I like this hoodie better than the Abercrombie Essential hoodie! So soft, and the quality is amazing. Definitely oversized. I want one in every color:)"" — Jen Schumacher Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in 22 colors and sizes S–XL). Check out a TikTok of the Petcube in action. Petcube is a California-based small business established in 2012 that specializes in interactive HD pet camera products. It's also app-enabled and can send you instant notifications, sync with Amazon Alexa, and even access a vet on demand if you notice any weird behaviors. Promising review : ""Unbeatable for the money. I needed a way to keep an eye on a new 4-month-old puppy who kept digging holes in my yard. I didn't expect a lot for $39, but I was pleasantly surprised. The video is quick to get started and very clear, zoom is quick, and the night vision actually works . I haven't used any of the other features yet, but these alone make this a great value! Far exceeding what I expected."" — Rick Grisham Get it from Amazon for $12.49+ (available in multipacks and with a subscription). Promising review: ""I’ve been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical! Fit great, and with the price point, I don’t have to worry too much with my kids and being on the go!"" — Jessica M Get a pack of three from Amazon for $18.99 (available in 16 sets, as well as two-packs and individual pairs). Promising review: ""LOVE. It is super comfortable to wear and is great for supporting my chest when I go on a run. Doesn't collect sweat. Very nice and cool material for hotter environments. I have it in so many colors because I love them so much. HIGHLY recommend!"" — Cheyenne Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–XXL and 29 colors). Promising reviews: ""I purchased this bag because of the Chanel look and I’ve gotten lots of compliments on this bag. I’m glad I purchased it."" — Carrollpickard ""I needed a new everyday bag and wanted it to have a kinda upscale look without having to spend too much. I'm so pleased with this purchase. It is now my favorite every day bag. It's not too big (I don't like carrying big bags) , but you can carry a nice amount of stuff in it. The color is nice and feels sturdy. I plan on buying a couple more colors!"" — Brittany Get it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in 16 colors). Promising review: ""Let me spill the tea — it's giving major Gucci vibes! This bag is a total [alternative], and I'm here for it!!!!! It's super cute, perfectly sized, and I'm completely obsessed. The snake print design adds that touch of luxury and edginess that I crave in a purse. Whether I'm rocking a casual look or dolled up for a night out, this bag pulls everything together like magic. The chain detail? For the price, it's everything. Talk about a chic statement piece. If you're all about that Gucci-esque style without breaking the bank then get ready to turn heads and have everyone wondering, 'Is that a Gucci?' Oh honey, it's a fashion secret we'll keep to ourselves."" — Rita Get it from Amazon for $35.99 (available in 21 colors). Promising reviews: ""Helps with pain relief and massage in pressure spots I wasn't able to get before. I had access to use a TheraGun before and haven't noticed any difference between items, and it's at a much lower price point. Whatever extra TheraGun features there might be, I haven't needed and the heads are interchangeable between TheraGun and this. Very happy with my purchase."" — tauntaun ""I used a TheraGun for about a month and although it was great, this unit is better suited for my needs. I found the TheraGun to be too powerful on the lowest setting and bulky to handle. Some people prefer a lower setting than the 'professional' brand offers. This unit is also easier to handle when massaging my partner than the TheraGun. This gun goes from a comfortable low setting to very powerful on the highest setting. Much better fit for me and my partner, plus it's got a solid battery life. "" — Pierremoe Get it from Amazon for $69.99+ (available in eight colors). Promising reviews: ""These are the best. Sooo much better than Mr. Clean Magic Eraser. Won't buy those anymore and these will last me a very long time. I scrubbed and they got everything clean and didn't break apart!!! Can even reuse if I wanted."" — miguel mendez ""I own a cleaning business and have spent a small fortune on the name brand. I clean everything from condo rentals to long-term lease/residential rentals and I have had to clean unimaginable NASTY, I mean 'pics or it didn't happen' kind of nasty, and these cut right through it. These work just as well as the name brand, if not better, and they seem to last a little longer! "" — Keisha Marie Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $14.95 . The weights are covered with a sweatproof, skin-friendly silicone layer that's comfortable, and the adjustable elastic band helps you get the right fit. You can even remove weights as well if needed! Promising review : ""I love these! So great for yoga or mat Pilates. I like that they are 2 pounds each, which is the perfect weight, and you can even take off weight as well. I use them every week for my workouts. Very durable band as well!"" — Robyn Get a pair from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes and 14 colors). Promising review: ""This bag is amazing!! It’s the perfect size for all my gym stuff. Clothes, shoes, water bottle, pre-workout, headphones, toiletries, etc., and it can be made smaller or bigger height-wise with these little buttons they have on the side that you can snap down . Very cute. It also has some inside mesh pockets to help separate things better. If you're thinking about it, just buy it! You won’t regret it."" — Sarah Brackenrich Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in two sizes and dozens of colors). Promising reviews: ""I have used this several times now using oven heat at 400 degrees Fahrenheit. No chipping of enamel or any other problems. It works as well as the Staub , maybe better with the enamel interior. Considering the low price, this would be my preferred Dutch oven."" — David "" Le Creuset? Don't know her. I have always wanted one of these enamel-covered cast iron beauties, but they were expensive even in outlet stores. I saw this guy after finding a stew recipe that went from stove to oven, and I got it. I am DELIGHTED with this purchase! I've cooked in it several times, including a chili recipe tonight that had to reduce by half. It left a ridiculous ring on the inside, and that sucker wiped right out. I haven't burned or scorched any of my foods and it's pretty, too! "" — HerRoyalHighness Get it from Amazon for $32.01+ (available in three sizes and 10 colors). Like many of us on the BuzzFeed Shopping team, my colleague Mal Mower is a huge fan of this mascara: ""It was one of my first BuzzFeed Shopping list impulse purchases! I was sold by all the wild customer images (it feels like this stuff makes lashes illegally long!) and positive reviews. I was *so* excited to get my hands on their brown version! I have naturally light lashes and red hair, so black lashes look really unnatural on me. I've loved using the brown and having a color that better complements my skin/hair. You can see my before and after photos above. This stuff is magic."" Promising reviews : "" The best I’ve tried so far and I used Dior, Tarte, Two Faced, you name it. I always have a problem with brand-new mascara because they have too much product on the brush, especially first few uses, and my lashes stick together. I didn’t have this problem with this one. I could layer it without any product starting to fall off or my lashes sticking together. And I love that they don’t test on animals."" — Detti Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown). BuzzFeed Shopping Editor Maitland Quitmeyer says this is her go-to satin pillowcase : ""I have two Slip pillowcases, and several of these, and actually the Bedsure ones wash up much nicer and retain an incredibly silky smooth feel after dozens of trips through the laundry. They're the only ones I'll buy going forward, and I recommended them to my mom and now she's in love with them too!"" Promising reviews: ""I ordered these pillowcases just to see if they could compete with Blissy. Well, they can . I have washed them three times and they came out great. They seem to protect your hair and skin. So, I’m very happy with them."" — EMc "" Arguably, they’re softer than my more expensive ones! They did arrive very wrinkled but a quick wash and dry and they’re shiny and wrinkle free. I like the envelope closure a lot more than competing brands zip closure."" — Hannah Watkins Get a set of two from Amazon for $6.99 (available in standard, queen, king, and body pillow sizes and 35 colors). This stuff is gold. I'm relatively new to the Poreless Putty Primer fandom but now that I'm here, I'm not leaving anytime soon. This makes SUCH a difference in how my foundation goes on , and it makes it look as close to poreless as I think is humanly possible — and maintains the smooth look for many hours! Just be sure to let it sit for a little bit before applying your foundation. Promising review: ""Okay so first nothing will make you 'poreless' but this stuff is amazing. Will even out fine lines and help with super porous areas; my T-zone [has really visible] pores and this definitely gave me a boost in confidence. I would highly recommend. Especially to those not to familiar with makeup, this is a game changer. Honestly it works better than my $30 primer from Urban Decay and lasts all day. I am oily so I usually blot some powder on later in the day but if you have dry skin this could be the ultimate game changer!"" — Olivia Get it from Amazon for $10 . Promising review: ""I bought these sandals before a three-week trip in Europe; I didn't want to pay for Birks but did want something in similar style with good arch support. I was a little skeptical about the low price but gave them a shot...and they were the MOST comfortable sandals I've ever owned. I walked over 120 miles in them in three weeks on our trip and never once had foot pain. They broke in so quickly and were very supportive from the get-go — and still are! Highly recommend."" — Han Lin Get them from Amazon for $24.48+ (available in sizes 5–12, including wide sizes, and 21 styles). For reference, the Laneige lip mask contains 20 grams of product, while each of these measures 5 grams, or 15 grams for the entire set. So even with product sizes taken into account, these are a much better deal! Promising review : ""It’s been four months since ordering this and it’s now part of my nightly routine. I can’t go to bed before putting this on. I highly recommend this! And it’s worth it to get the three-pack. The flavors are not overly sweet and I think my favorite is the berry. I like it more than the Laneige night lip mask. For me, Laneige absorbs pretty quickly and in the morning I feel like my lips are dry again . With these, my still lips feel moisturized in the morning . It has a thicker consistency. I used to get dry/peeling lips pretty often as I’m outdoors/in the ocean a lot. However, since incorporating this in my routine, I haven’t had peeling lips in a long time. Loooove these!"" — Angela Get it from Amazon for $9.90 (available in five sets). Promising reviews: ""Similar to the Drunk Elephant bronzing drops but half the cost!!! Definitely has more shimmer/glow to it."" — Taylor Luckhardt ""This is EXACTLY what I was looking for. I apply after moisturizer and makeup, highlighting under my eyes and brow bones. Not too sparkly, just makes me look like I’ve had enough coffee. Seems to last through hot and sweaty Florida days, so that’s a plus. I’ve tried other luminizers, and for me they are usually too sparkly or weirdly colored. I tried an $$ Glossier one that remained strangely sticky the whole time it was on my skin. "" — DLW Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in six shades). Promising review : ""I’m SOO impressed with the quality of this bag! I’ve worn the Lululemon belt bag and I gotta say, this is pretty similar. Almost identical, except the Lululemon is a tiny bit smaller size. The Lululemon one also has a plastic zipper but this Amazon one is metal. I prefer the plastic but this one is OK. It might be better than Lululemon JUST for the fact that they have so many color options!"" — Em Get it from Amazon for $12.98 (available in 39 styles). Promising review: ""These are absolutely BEAUTIFUL! If I didn't know any better, I would have said these are the Bottega Drop Earrings . I personally love the smaller ones. I have not ordered the larger ones yet. Smaller ones are truthfully the perfect size. We love a good alternative because who has $800+ to spend on the Bottegas."" — Brittany Get them from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 11 colors, two-packs, and an extra-large size). Check it out on TikTok . Promising reviews: ""Bought this dress because I always wanted to get the House of CB dress but didn’t want to pay over $250 for it. It’s honestly so good! I got the size large in this since they didn’t have my normal sizes, which are small to medium (I have a bigger chest, so I tend to size up). But since this has a corset back, I was able to cinch it up really tight and it fit perfectly!"" — Chris Herfurth Kennedy ""Beautiful, stunning perfection. This may be the best thing I've ever bought on Amazon. The corset in the back makes it fit like it was made for me. It's double-lined and not see-through at all, even though it's white. The straps are adjustable, the slit is a good height, and the fabric is slightly stretchy. I cannot say enough good things about it. It did come slightly wrinkly in the skirt, but nothing that a good steam won't fix."" — Shoshanna Get it from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in 20 colors/styles and sizes 0–14). Promising reviews: ""I was skeptical about this product at first but I am so glad I decided to buy it. It really removes my makeup, even waterproof mascara with ease. It has no smell and doesn't leave my face oily. It reminds me of my Bioderma that I got in the UK. And for this price, amazing!"" — Kat ""I've been using makeup wipes my whole life because I didn't even know this existed. I saw it in stores but nobody ever told me what this was. This is literally amazing, buy reusable pads and this and you're set for life. I'm really upset nobody ever told me what this stuff was. I don't understand why makeup wipes even exist...this cleanses your face, takes off your makeup. Nobody should not know what this stuff is ."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $8.97 . BTW, this is our budget pick for the best makeup remover ! Promising review: ""This Chanel [alternative] is very in style right now. I wear them to work a lot with dark denim and a blazer. Or white jeans and a blazer. The heel is not too high, so it gives my 5’4” frame a little lift but not too much to get achy feet. I like the sling back because it stays on without blistering or moving around, and adds extra interest other than my solid black or nude pumps I wear to the office every day . I’m a size 6 with a narrow foot and these were true to size. I’m sure I’ll get many years out of these shoes. They are a staple for the wardrobe without the hefty Chanel price tag. Love them!"" — ND Get it from Amazon for $49.99 (available in sizes 5–12). Promising reviews: ""Such cute shoes that are maybe even better than the designer inspiration! I ordered a 37 and usually am a 6.5. They fit perfectly. The footbed is more padded than the designer version. Leather is soft and comfortable on the foot. Sole is not slippery."" — Emily Wilson ""The shoes come very nicely packaged! These are my favorite shoes, once you break them in they are like BUTTER. I have bought two pairs myself, I own them in black and in white. My mom has them in black and wears them to work every day; she wanted to have a backup pair bc she loves them SO much. My brother wants to get a pair, too. LOL. I could not recommend these shoes more; I get so many compliments…people even think they are Gucci !"" — Caroline King Get it from Amazon for $49.89+ (available in sizes 5–12 and in 10 colors). Promising review: ""Run, Forrest, run!! Don’t walk!! This is a perfect Vivienne Westwood [alternative]. I bought this when I didn’t have enough money for the real one, but unless you do a microscopic closeup of the two, this necklace is the literal perfect [copy] of the original . It feels pretty weighty and doesn’t tarnish easily. The size is also perfect and the color matches the real one better than the other ones in the market. The packaging was also super cute and protective."" — Ziaaaa Get a two-pack (gold and silver) from Amazon for $13.99 (available in two other styles). Reviewers agree that if you want it fitted, size down. Promising reviews: ""I saw this girl wearing this exact style of dress with a Skims tag on the back, and honestly, it made me so grateful that I purchased this dress instead. It looks exactly like the Skims version, and I could be biased, but the material of this dress looked better than the Skims one. If you want it to be a little snug, I would definitely recommend sizing down one size from your normal size. So freaking comfortable and made out of thick material."" — Kaitlyn ""I have the Skims dress in black and wanted to look for a cheaper version, but read reviews and some said that it is a bit looser than expected. I would agree that the small is a bit loose. If you want a snatched look, definitely get a size smaller, as it is very stretchy . I'm 5' tall so this is a bit long on me, even when I wear heels. In comparison to the Skims, the material is smoother while Skims has a ribbed texture. You honestly can't tell the difference. Good bang for your buck, if you ask me! "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in sizes XXS–XL and eight colors). Promising review: ""I’d been looking for a Skims alternative — I have the Skims dress, love it, and wanted it in another color. Ordered a size large, which is my normal size, and it fit perfectly! I’m so very happy with my purchase! Literally half the price of Skims and it's identical! If you’ve tried the Skims dress, go ahead and order, you won’t be disappointed!"" — Savvychique Get it from Amazon for $36.99 (available in sizes XS–XXL and nine colors). BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord says: ""I'm a Glossier Cloud Paint stan, so I'll continue to buy it, but I love this affordable alternative, too! It spreads on super easily and can either go on sheer or build for a bolder effect. I got the Rose Flush shade and enjoy it for ~everyday wear~ since it's so easy to squirt a bit on my fingers, swirl it into my cheeks, and be on my merry way. It lasts all day and looks super natural to boot!"" Promising review: ""This is a great, cheap alternative to Glossier Cloud Paint. It’s less pigmented and blends more easily, so it looks very natural."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $5.57+ (available in six shades). Some reviewers said that they were able to skip wearing a bra with it! Promising reviews: ""Okay this is so good. I had the Zara bodysuit identical to this, but it quickly got stretched out, so I tried this one out. It is 10 times better than that one. The fit is perfect, it hugs you just right, and is supportive enough that I won’t wear a bra. Also, not see-through at all! Amazing. Need in all the colors."" — Dawn E. ""Saw these in a TikTok, and I took a chance. The sherbet orange one looks just like the picture, and it’s double-layered material, so it’s not see-through. It’s smooth material and lays flat. Will def buy more."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.97+ (available in sizes XS–XXL and 29 colors). Promising review: ""This is a product where you can’t say “you get what you paid for” because it really looks sophisticated. It doesn’t look cheap . I bought this because the Cartier love bracelets are very expensive and I don’t like doing the screw because I don’t plan to always wear them since I have a little kid and sometimes it’s uncomfortable. If you want a Cartier love bracelet [alternative], this is it! Easy to open and close. Very flawless. Why did I just think about this!? Lol."" — Shiexil Get it from Amazon for $11.03+ (available in three finishes, nine other styles, and five sizes). Promising review: ""The perfect non-name-brand ring you can find, honestly. I wasn't looking for a Cartier knock-off when I found this ring, but I have had people ask me if it's the real deal . I honestly love this ring, though; the sizing was accurate, it is weighted well, none of the 'diamonds' have fallen off, and it hasn't tarnished! I've worn it daily for almost a year now and it has held up well. It has some very small scratches on it, but that's typical of most rings. For the price, I am super happy with this ring and I honestly can't believe how well it has handled everything I've put it through."" — Eva Richterkessing Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in three finishes, two styles, and sizes 5–12). Promising reviews: ""I LOVE this skirt! I have the original Nike one and they are identical. The only difference is that it doesn’t have a logo on it, but tbh, I prefer the no-logo look. It’s such a good buy and SO comfortable!"" — Tayler ""I was skeptical at first but once it arrived! WOW! I love this skirt! I need one in every color now. Very comfortable, breathable fabric, and the skirts have secret pockets on the inside of the shorts! I really like it, and the length is perfect! Oh, and there’s a super cool thick band around the skirt top. It looks very nice I received a lot of compliments on skirt! Definitely recommend! ❤️"" — VM Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in nine colors and XS–XXL). Promising reviews: ""It was the perfect mini length, not too short. Keep in mind this skirt is very high waisted, if that isn’t what you’re looking for. Ordered the white and it’s not see through if worn with nude underwear. I love it! Looks just like the one from Aritzia for $100. Might ordered another color :): — Sam Waldbillig ""I LIVE in these skirts. I am back to order more so I figured I would leave a review. These skirts make any outfit standout . Last night I paired the off-white skirt with a black turtleneck, scarf, and knee high boots. Let me tell you, it was giving ELEGANT. I definitely recommend these skirts. They also hold up over time and iron well. Fits true to size."" — LarZ Get it from Amazon for $20.99 (available in sizes XS–XL and 34 colors/styles). Promising reviews: ""Soooo pretty. It’s 100% a Swarovski [alternative] for so cheap. Looks exactly like the photo, and I wear it every day."" — Trysten Walters ""I just lost my very real gold tennis bracelet. I’ve heard good things about this company and decided to order one that looked like the one I lost. It just came in, and it looks as nice as my real one. I don’t know how it will do as time goes, but for $19, it’s a great buy."" — Alina Get it from Amazon for $19.95+ (available in three lengths, 14-karat gold-plated or 18-karat gold vermeil, and in yellow, rose, or white gold). Promising reviews: ""Love these so so much. I wanted the chic Bottega Veneta designer pair, but these look exactly like those for less than $20. Deal of the century. They are comfortable and extremely well made and I seriously can’t get over the price. I’m thinking about buying another color because I love them so much."" — Kam ""I saw these sunglasses on TikTok a couple of months ago and finally ordered them. I’m so glad I did. I LOVE them!! They’re such good quality! And I love the way they look on. I’d definitely buy them again!!"" — Sammie Batey Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in 14 colors). Promising review: ""So far I have used about four bottles of this product. I use it like a serum and put a few drops on my face and décolleté before I apply moisturizer in the morning or night cream. I see the same outstanding results I did see with the TNS Serum — just for a fraction of the price!!! "" — nana bendick Get it from Amazon for $17.98 . Some versions of the jacket have pockets, too! Promising review: ""TikTok brought me here! I saw many reviews for the Lululemon BBL jacket; however, I was not ready to spend over $100 on a jacket. I’m a frugal gal. I absolutely love this jacket; my boyfriend told me it looked great, and I got many compliments. Truly the perfect alternative for the BBL jacket !"" — Bri Campos Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in sizes XS–XL and in 15 colors). Promising review: ""This (to me) is catchier than the actual Gucci belt and also a great price. The design is sophisticated; the leather strap and clasp do not feel cheap. The leather strap is rigid, but not too rigid. The clasp has the two loops that clasp into the holes in the leather strap. It holds nicely and is comfortable to wear, put on/ take off. I felt that this accessory (when added to any outfit) can make any outfit pop! Definitely a great statement piece to own!"" — helzbelz Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in sizes XS–XL and in seven colors). Promising review: ""I have Fenty Cherry Treat, a lip oil from Dior, and several other brands that were $20 or more…and the Nyx Fat Oil is better! Same consistency as the others, but a little more color, which is a good thing. About as long lasting as any other thick lipgloss. It’s always awesome to find a less expensive [option] for the high-end products I like."" — Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $8.70 (available in 14 shades). Promising review: ""No joke, these are pretty much exactly the same as my Skims lounge set for half the price . The pants graze the tops of my feet even when I wear them high-waisted at my belly button, so I think they’re plenty long. The robe is like wearing a blanket, but still looks put together. Anyway, I’m back here to buy a second color because I loved them so much !"" — Jenna Get the three-piece set from Amazon for $54.99 (available in sizes S–XL and in 24 colors).

Hooray!!!"" — Churchcooky Price: $170+ (also available in white) Price: $99.99+ (available in nine colors) Promising review: ""This was probably the best Walmart purchase I have ever made. Very high-quality and easy to install. I would recommend that, for people like myself who installed it for surrounding two electronic bed frames, that you reinforce the sides with part of the wood that comes with the middle support.

They fit on the sofa together when the beagle-dachshund is willing to share."" — Mary Price: $114.22 Promising review: ""I bought two in espresso brown, they matched my kitchen cabinets perfectly. I used two in my kitchen nook to make a banquette look. They are sturdy and took me about 1 hour and 45 minutes each to build. You will need help with putting together the two large portions with the dividers, as it's like a puzzle, and you have to pop both sides together. The bench pieces are heavy to hold up, and do that on your own.

I am so so happy with this purchase. The table and chairs are not only a good size, but they are tall! I myself am almost 6 foot tall, and to not have to lean over with a patio set is really cool. The cushions are very comfortable, and the setup was extremely easy. Highly recommend."" — Ashley k Get it from Amazon for $137.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review : ""This washer was easy to set up and operate. I bought it to pressure wash the railings on my back patio, but once I saw how well it worked, I ended up doing my patio furniture, stone patio, steps, a stone wall, garage doors, and one side of my house. It took several hours to do all that, but it was really satisfying. Some of it was seven years' worth of grime, and some were only two years. This machine handled it all. I plan to do it all once a year to keep it looking great."" — nylon21 Get it from Amazon for $199 . Promising review : ""Great value for the $$ and attractive! Looks great on my back porch area and a nice place to store all my planting supplies . The metal countertop is a nice touch, as it’s easy to wipe down and gives it a bit of a rustic look. I highly recommend and would buy it again!"" — Staci Evans Get it from Amazon for $134.98+ (available in three wood finishes). Note : The umbrella stand is not included, but this is a good one if you need one. Promising review : ""This umbrella was perfect and met my needs. I live in a condo and needed a way to shade the balcony from the intense morning sun. This worked really well. The set up was easy. The crank works well and the tilt is easy to do."" — Danielle Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in 15 colors and patterns).  Note: It has three different brightness settings and requires AA batteries . Promising review: ""This light is great!!! It has three settings, to adjust the amount of brightness you need. Lowest level is great for just sitting around your patio table and having a couple of drinks with friends. Brightest setting is PERFECT for playing cards! We play cards a few times a month. We decided to try and play outside. There are two 70+-year-olds who did not complain that they couldn’t see. So, works great in my book! 😁"" — Mandie Jordan Get it from Amazon for $9.98 . Promising review : ""This set is beautiful, good quality — especially for the price and so sleek and bold looking! I ordered this twice because I was so thrilled with the first set I ordered!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $114.99 . This weatherproof fan has a fully sealed and permanently lubricated industrial motor to protect it against wetness. Promising review : ""Great fan at a good price! I bought this fan for my backyard to help circulate the air in hot days and to help deter mosquitoes at night around the firepit. This fan worked perfectly. It has three speeds, the highest of which is super strong. The fan at high speed is a bit noisy, but nothing unexpected of a powerful fan. It is also 100% waterproof, which is a must. My only minor issues would be 1) it would be nice if the fan came with a cover for when it’s not used (I bought 20-inch tire storage covers to do the job), and 2) the fan is only adjustable up and down not side to side — if they could make it oscillate that would be great. Having said that, I would recommend this fan for sure and would not hesitate to buy it again."" — Bigdad Get it from Amazon for $85.95+ (available in two sizes). Promising review : ""So I'm no plant pot-biologist, but these are awesome. They're durable and strong. The handles are stitched on super well . They also are solid enough to hold the soil and plant with no problem while letting enough oxygen to the roots to create a bigger root ball leading to bigger plants/yields. Best mesh flower pots by far."" — Ram C Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in tan or black and in 10 sizes). Promising review : ""These are great for plants! I have three five-gallon geranium plants that don't like to get wet. For the last couple of years, I was lugging them around back and forth on the patio. What a relief for my back that I don't have to do that anymore. The trays are sturdy and deep enough that water doesn't come out all over the ground, either. I like the wheel locking feature in case I want them to stay in place, and the maneuverability of them is great. "" — Cheryl Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in two colors). Promising review: "" My favorite purchase for our deck. I LOVE this fire table. Good size, great value compared to what is out there. Puts out a decent amount of heat. Enough rocks to adequately cover. Just add your propane tank. I love that it has a lid as well. You will find sturdier fire tables, but not at this price. Excellent value."" — Bellium Get it from Amazon for $169.99+ (available in two sizes; be sure to clip the $30 off coupon). Promising review : ""I love this loveseat ... when my cat is not hoarding it 😩 I spend so much time sitting longways on it, reading books. It’s lightweight but sturdy — I weigh over 200 pounds and feel supported while stretched out on it. It was also super easy to assemble. I normally hire someone to assemble anything that comes in pieces, but I was able to tackle this alone in about 45 minutes."" — Brittney-Elizabeth Williams Get it from Amazon for $189.99+ (available in beige or blue and 1-, 3-, or 5-piece sets). Hauteloom is a small business in Georgia that sells rugs for the home. Promising review : ""Delivered exactly as described. This is a really beautiful outdoor rug that adds coziness and pop to my deck. I put heavy items around the perimeter of the rug for a day to help flatten the edges. Great price for a great quality rug."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $35+ (available in 15 sizes and three colors). Promising review : ""Loved this compact version of an egg chair. It it gorgeous and doesn’t take up too much space on the patio. It was very easy to put together and the instructions were clear and simple to read. This chair is very sturdy and doesn’t seem like it will unravel or break. The cushions are very plush, and the covers unzip and can easily be cleaned in a washing machine. Overall, this purchase has been so worth it."" — Evelyn Ndidi Get it from Amazon for $118.50+ (available in three styles). Promising review: ""Pretty easy to put together. I carried the box up to my third-floor apt and assembled myself. Great quality and comfortable. Perfect for my tiny balcony."" — Christine E. Johnson Get it from Amazon for $151.99+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""OMG this is cute and super easy to assemble. I got the red and kinda wish I had gotten the blue... oh but all the colors are so cute!! Debating buying a second one so each porch chair has its own table. This really is so incredibly versatile. I could see it on a porch, as a minimalist side table, in a kid's room, a place to keep plants... I wouldn't put anything tremendously heavy on it, but as far as tables at this price go, this is the best!"" — Meghan McD Get it from Amazon for $36.99+ (available in 21 styles and colors). Promising review : ""Scotts EZ Seed Patch and Repair Sun and Shade for Grass is truly a lifesaver for my lawn! I had numerous dead spots caused by my dogs' urine, and I needed a solution fast. After applying this magic dust as directed, followed by watering, I was amazed by the results. The dead patches transformed into lush, green grass in no time! This product definitely lives up to its promises and works wonders for repairing damaged areas on the lawn. Just be sure to follow the directions closely for best results. I highly recommend Scotts EZ Seed Patch and Repair Sun and Shade for anyone looking to revitalize their lawn effortlessly."" — MJ Get it from Amazon for $16.44 . Promising review: ""I am pleased with this product so far. The cushions are comfy and it's a good height for sitting. Assembly was easy and didn't take long. I can't wait to enjoy more days on my porch with this set."" — Kathrin Kimmons Get it from Amazon for $139.19+ (available in four cushion colors). It comes with the insert! Gift A Pillow is a family-owned small business in Ohio that makes personalized pillows for every occasion. Promising review: ""Great quality and they look great with our deck lounge chairs. Can't wait for warm weather!"" — Jennie Get it from Gift A Pillow on Etsy for $39.95 . Promising review : ""We love this lounge chair!!! The price was fabulous!! (And just a note... If you take care of your things — i.e. cover up the swing with a tarp and bring the cushions in when not using it — It will stay like new. Sun and rain can age anything! Easy-peasy!!) This lounge swing is so comfortable and made very well!! It only took my hubby and I 25–30 minutes to put together. Take my word for it... you are not going to find a nicer lounge swing at this price!! "" — Marash Get it from Amazon for $199.99 (available in 15 colors). The corners of the sails have D rings so you can attach them to whatever you'd like with your choice of hardware or rope. Promising review : ""Purchased this to increase privacy and provide some shade. The color is vibrant, hasn't faded, and the loops are well-stitched. The sail has also fared well in winds, thunderstorms, monsoon rain, and the brutal heat of Vegas. Shade is wonderful and one can definitely feel the temperature difference from full sun to being under this sail. The look and feel compliments our pool area and will certainly be purchasing an additional one."" — VHC Media Get it from Amazon for $16.79+ (available in a variety of sizes and 16 colors/patterns). Promising reviews: ""Living in Hawaii, you have to select wise items that are weather-, salt-, and red dirt–proof, etc... In total I ordered 11 boxes to complete my yoga deck. I have a few left over to make steps on the back. Very pleased and happy. May order more for an outdoor shower project!"" — Adazzle ""Bought these in 2016, and with one application of teak oil per year, they still look great in 2023. They have been subjected to full weather for 7 years and still look amazing. Lightly power wash them once a year to remove grime, takes about 30 min."" — Z Get 10 square feet from Amazon for $81.99 . Promising review : ""We have a small patio close to a grassy area where the neighborhood dogs do their business — so annoying and smelly — so we needed a way to get lots of florals in while also providing some privacy. These are perfect and hold lots of florals; the ivy I have is already beginning to climb the trellis, and they're sturdy!! We live in a windy area, and so far, they haven't budge. Also so, so easy to put together!! Took us less than a half hour probably."" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $76.49+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""Good quality. Easy to assemble. Parts are individually bagged and labeled. Holds two 32-gallon round barrels — which is what I wanted it for. Very compact, which was a factor for where I had to put it."" — Joe in Brooklyn Get it from Amazon for $238.88+ (available in nine styles). Champion Sports is a family-owned and operated small business that's been operating out of New Jersey since 1961. Promising review : ""I bought this for the kids to play during cookouts. We have corn hole and other games as well, and I find myself playing this as much, if not more, than corn hole. Great quality, and it comes with a carrying bag to put away for easy storage and clean up."" — Alan Rich Get it from Amazon for $119.99+ (available in two sizes). Pure Wood Design is a small business based in Turkey making wooden bar top tables. Promising review : ""This table got to me so fast! I needed something small for my tiny patio just to set my coffee on while I sit on my swing chair in the morning. The quality is incredible.

BuzzFeed Staff And if you (like me) try to avoid scented products because your skin is sensitive, you'll be happy to know this is fragrance-free! Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could buy larger containers of it."" — Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.19 . For permanent markers specifically, reviewers say it does take some time and scrubbing, but they were able to get most if not all of the stain out with persistence! Promising review: ""Imagine large blobs of permanent blue Sharpie on a white football uniform. Now imagine that the ink had sat on the garment for over a week before the uniform was washed and dried by a mom completely unaware of the ink blobs. This product took out 95%+ of the ink and was easy to use. Now said kiddo does not look like the only one with a spotted jersey. A+ result."" — Baby B's Mom Get it from Amazon for $8.38+ (available in three sizes). Promising review : ""This stuff is incredible. I had suffered from minor acne for almost two years and I finally realized the products I was using were far too harsh for my dry, sensitive skin. After using gentle products and eventually moving onto k-beauty, I found this to lighten all the scarring from the years of picking at my breakouts . My scarring is still a bit noticeable but it was gotten tremendously better thanks to this product and this product alone. Pictures [above] show my acne a while ago and a more recent picture."" — Marc Get it from Amazon for $18.60 . Note: Furniture Clinic (the maker of this product) recommends testing to see if your leather is absorbent before using this product by seeing if a drop of water will soak into the undamaged part of the leather. If the water is able to soak in, use this balm! If it cannot soak in, they recommend using their leather repair paint instead. Promising review : "" The sofa in the pictures [above] is 10 years old and well used . My wife and I could not believe the results after using the balm. Really got rid of the cracks. Amazing stuff. Highly recommend it. The two pictures are before and after using the product on one arm of the sofa. Match the color, and it is magic!

Caffeine can brighten skin and temporarily minimize the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that’s something you’re looking for in a product. Read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""Like so many, I was brainwashed by TikTok into buying this rather expensive lotion...then I bought one for my mom, and one for my sister and five more for myself as they became harder to find. My favorite thing about it is the smell. Lightly tropical/coconutty but nothing overwhelming. Every time I wear it people say, 'What are you WEARING?' like I have some amazing perfume on. Besides that, it really is a great moisturizer. I’m not usually a sucker for marketing but this was so worth it. "" — Kristen Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in two sizes and a refill size). This shampoo is hypoallergenic, cruelty-free, and paraben-free. I've used Ecotools brush cleaning shampoo for years, and it makes cleaning my brushes so much easier. I just add a bit of the shampoo to my brush and gently rub it against a silicone mat under running water, and it makes quick work of removing all the makeup that's built up on my brush for, frankly, way too long. You'll see the water start running brown immediately, which is always super gross but also really satisfying, and once you see your brush return to its original color, you know you're done. And the bristles are always left as soft as before too! Promising review: ""I've been skeptical about items that seem like glorified soap but got it as a gift. This cleaned my brushes like nothing else, with just a drop, a few seconds of spreading it around, and literally about 10 seconds of swishing in warm water. It was unbelievable. It took out weeks of caked-on 24-hour concealer and foundation, and left my brush soft and fluffy like it were brand new. I will always use this (and my brushes will always be clean!). It's nothing short of miraculous ."" — Chloe Get it from Amazon for $5.69 . To clean, you just rinse it under water and let it air-dry. It even comes with a lid for sanitary storage! Promising review : ""This foot scrubber deserves a 5-star review! It’s literally the best foot scrubber out there! I’ve tried the metal exfoliators, pumice stones, so many pedicures, etc. You name it, I’ve tried it. This is the ONLY one that has scrubbed off all of the dead/cracked skin on my heels and made them smooth again. I’m so excited I found this!"" — Alli Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in two colors and another shape). Promising review: ""I wish I took before and after pictures because the results are unbelievable with no scrubbing or elbow grease . We have a stone floor/wall shower with stupid large and annoyingly mold prone grout lines. I used it per the directions and rinsed with hot hot water the next morning, and couldn’t believe all the crap that rinsed off. Seriously worth every penny!"" — Kate Get it from Amazon for $20.98 (available in two scents and two sizes). This pumice stone cleaner is free of chemicals and odors. It also has a heavy-duty plastic handle so you'll have a solid grip while you clean. Use gentle back-and-forth motions to remove stains and deposits from inside the toilet bowl, and voila! Promising review: ""It really does work on the toughest hard water stains. It really is like magic. I used it for all my toilet bowls. However, a couple of notices you should know before buying: 1) You need patience, especially if your toilet bowls have very old stains. It took me 30 minutes of constant grinding, and I used the entire stick. 2) Do not push down on the stick aggressively; it will break in half, and I had to use it by hand. Cleaning power is incredible. I recommend this product."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . It's recommended that you do a patch test 24–48 hours before applying this all over your face, as it's a strong, concentrated formula. After that, apply three to five drops once daily and follow with a moisturizer (ideally one with SPF if you apply in the morning!). Though the bottle looks small, reviewers say it'll last you several months with daily use. Promising review : ""I should have started using this years ago! I’m in my mid-30s and I’ve tried everything including much more expensive brands, Korean skincare, Japanese skincare, etc. but I’ve always had breakouts and problems with texture. This is by far the best vitamin C product I’ve tried. I’ve tried multiple vitamin C serums in the past, but they always broke me out or had a slimy or gritty texture. This serum has a smooth texture, soaks in quickly, does not pill with other products, and has noticeably cleared up my skin."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $38.99 . Be sure to follow the brand's instructions on how to use these together! Promising review : ""I'm in my mid-30s and realized it was time to step up my skincare game. I always looked younger than my age, but recently that's worn off a bit, and makeup remover wipes and argan oil at night weren't cutting it. I happened across this trio and, for the price, thought I'd give it a try. My skin feels AMAZING!!! This trio is worth every penny. I don't even feel like I have to wear makeup all the time anymore, and when I do, it goes on so much smoother . This is definitely going to be part of my routine for years to come!"" — Caitlin Get the pack of three from Amazon for $24.99 . Promising review : ""The 'abrasive sponge when cold' or 'squishy when hot' is an awesome feature for the type of scrubbing you want to do. The Pink Stuff with the sponge does wonders! We have a hideous 30-year-old shower and although it doesn’t look brand new like I was hoping, it’s 10 times better!! This product really does work!"" — GreenGoddess Get the set (one Pink Stuff jar and a ""Sqeezy"") from Amazon for $9.99. Promising review: ""I am a middle-aged antiquer who loves wood and authenticity. This product rejuvenates aged wood leaving the antique finishes in place. It really does just hydrate and polish your wood. We literally were running around the house arguing over who got to hold the bottle as we treated all of the wood in our home. The transformation is unbelievable! We are so happy with it we ordered three more right away and are planning a wine/polish weekend. Everything it touches turns out amazing, from my grandmother's 150-year-old wood-framed mirror to our 40-year-old china hutch. There is not a better product on the market. Buy this, you will not regret it."" — K.A.S. Get a bottle from Amazon for $9.98 . Readers also use this to keep their eyeglasses from fogging! Promising review: ""I had a cheap, untempered windshield that was awful in the rain. A friend of mine from college recommended Rain-X, and I was shocked at the difference. I applied it with a soft rag and sat there wondering if it was even on properly. I trusted the system and then later that night took my car out for a drive; it rained while I was out, and the difference was instantly noticeable. Before, when using my wipers, streaks would obscure my view so much that any lights would make driving in the rain hard. Now, the droplets don't smear, and smaller ones sometimes just roll off . It's pretty great."" — Alison J. Gong Get two bottles from Amazon for $11.98 . BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord uses this on the reg: ""FWIW re: scars, this stuff really works. I had thyroid surgery a few years ago, and Bio-Oil took me from looking like I'd stumbled out of the Red Wedding to virtually no detectable scar within a few months . All I did was apply it once in the morning and once at night."" Promising review: ""Acne scars? Read this. I found out about this product while scrolling through TikTok last week. It came highly recommended, so I decided to look up the price on Amazon. After reading several reviews, I figured I might as well try it out. Today is the fourth day I've used the product on my face. My skin looks dewy and nice. The discoloration on my cheeks from a few years old acne scars is improving. My skin looks younger — it’s hard to describe, but I can see a difference. It looks less rough. I’ve been using it morning and night."" — Yasmin Rodriguez Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in two sizes). Bushbalm is an Ottawa-based small skincare brand creating products for our most sensitive areas. Promising review: "" I've bought this product numerous times and it never fails. I have no more ingrowns and it also helps so much with irritation after shaving!"" — Pris Get it from Amazon or direct from Bushbalm for $26. See it in action on TikTok ! The tens of thousands of 5-star Amazon reviews are reason enough to add the ChomChom to your cart immediately — but let me add my own personal review to the stack. I've been using the ChomChom for quite a while now, and I took the photos above to show just how quick, easy, and effective this roller is. It took 10 seconds to rid my velvet couch ottoman (yes, velvet...a terrible cat owner choice, I know) of the hair my two gray kitties are constantly leaving everywhere. It takes a bit of practice to get the hang of using this roller — at first, I thought you only brushed down in one direction, and was confused why it wasn't picking up hair. It's important to do a push-and-pull brushing in *both* directions so it actually pulls the hair inside , which does require you to apply a bit of pressure. Afterward, you'll just dump out the hair that's been trapped inside. The ChomChom is best for large flat surfaces like couches and beds. Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in four colors). The after pic (above) was taken after about six weeks of use! A little goes a long way, so one bottle can last you a long time. Promising review: ""The product is a game changer for me. I would have dry creases under my eyes no matter how much primer or expensive foundation I used. I use this in the a.m. and p.m. and it has made a 100% difference. I was at the doctor’s waiting room and was chatting with a woman and I mentioned I was going to be 53 in two weeks. She was shocked and said she thought I was 35, saying I had barely had any wrinkles. It made my day!"" — Angela Kilburn Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in three sizes). Read more about how biotin shampoo could help with the fullness of hair at Cleveland Clinic . Promising review: ""I love this shampoo! I had gastric sleeve surgery and my hair was very, very thin. I started taking biotin and switched to biotin shampoo as recommended by my doctor. It doesn’t make your hair grow by washing it but it makes your hair and roots stronger. And it worked. After using the whole bottle, my hair was stronger. I had a lot of new growth that was sticking around (the previous new growth fell out early on) and my hair was getting thicker. Eight months later, my hair is back to normal. It's longer and thicker than ever. I still use it twice a week and love it! I [don't love] the way it smells but others love it when they smell my hair."" — Diane J. Huff Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in four sizes). Promising reviews: ""My stainless sink had streaks on it from using an ultra strong cleaner. It left a dark shading that I thought was permanent. I’ve tried scrubs, polishers, natural home remedies from online, just about everything. I read about this sink cleaner from an online best products on Amazon blog. I figured, I’ve tried everything else so I bought it. IT WORKED!!! I’m thrilled with this cleaner and it brought the finish back on my stainless steel sink. Highly recommend this product!!"" — loriregin ""I have a ceramic sink, but the drain was old and blackened from years of use. This product cleaned it up and shined the old drain. I had tried everything else but to no avail. Whatever is in this is just what you need for old sink metals ."" — BonLynLee Get it from Amazon for $9.95 (available in multiple sizes and packs). BuzzFeed Shopping editor Amanda Davis swears by this spray. Check out her Foot Matters Shoe Stretch spray review for more deets! BTW, Foot Matters is a small business that specializes in shoe-stretching products. Promising reviews: ""My sandals were awfully tight on the top of my feet. I tried everything before finally finding this spray. Nothing helped, there was no relief. Then I tried this spray, and it moved heaven and earth, and now my sandals are perfect! "" — Swissharpist ""I injured my foot a few months back, and most of my shoes don't fit. I've tried stretchers, hair dryer, wearing multiple socks — everything. I bought this stuff, and within a half hour, my problems were solved . Try this method first."" — Susan Olson Get it from Amazon for $10.99 . And psst — as much as we love I Dew Care's powder shampoo , this is a more budget-friendly option, offering twice the amount of product for a fraction of the price. Promising review: ""Best dry shampoo I've ever used. Love this product ! You can pat on how much you want, rub it in, and it absorbs all oils as it should. No white residue leftover and I have dark brown hair. My hair is still soft and flowy, it's not hard or crunchy like Monday dry shampoo makes my hair feel. Love this lil' thing so much!!"" — Sugar Magnolia Get it from Amazon for $9.88 . Promising review: ""I had a wart on my finger that I had been trying to get rid of for a while. I used all different kinds of freezing medicines and wart removers and ended up with this as a last resort before going to a doctor. These had my wart come off my finger within a week — no pain, literally just came off when I decided to change my bandage . Amazing!!"" — K Pic Get a 14-pack from Amazon for $7.29 . Promising review: ""I have a white tile floor and I was pretty sure the grout was white also, but it was hard to tell since it was so dirty. I had tried many different methods to clean the grout, with limited or no success, so I gave this product a whirl, and was very pleased with the results. Essentially, you squeeze the bottle, aiming for the grout lines, but in reality, it's a little hard to control, but eventually finds its way to the recessed grout lines, and then let it sit. I let mine sit for 10 minutes. You then need to use a scrub brush to 'agitate' the solution, and it lifted up an amazing amount of grime. You have to wipe up the dirty solution, which sometimes gets into the grout again, so a second application may be needed depending on how dirty your grout is. I have a 6'x6' tiled area on my bathroom floor, so it's a small area, and ended up using about half of the bottle, so this is fairly expensive, but in my opinion, it's well worth the expense because it's the only thing that's worked. "" — Joseph Canas Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (also available in bundles with a brush). Promising review: ""This product works!! High quality material, well made, easy to clean, corrosion resistant, at least in my experience. I can tell this will last a long time. And, it works!!!! Got rid of a coating on my tongue that other tongue scrapers and the tongue cleaners on toothbrushes did nothing for!! Noticed it got a lot off the first use!!! My tongue looks healthy, and my throat feels better. Once a thicker layer starts on the tongue due to postnasal drip there's nothing else that got rid of it. It's easy to hold, and doesn't gag me at all. It comes with a travel case, which I love because I don't want anything that goes in my mouth loose in a bag."" — Saffire Dragon Get a single pack with a travel case from Amazon for $5.49 . The Bissell Little Green machine offers strong spray and suction to remove tough pet stains with ease. It has a 48-ounce tank that allows you to do plenty of cleaning before a refill is needed.

Promising review: ""Two months ago we got a 6-month-old puppy who has needed some time to get adjusted. That included more than a few accidents in our living room and on his bed. This machine has made cleanup of everything so much simpler and I love that it's deep cleaning and has a nontoxic pet cleaner so that our not-so-little puppy isn't harmed through exposure or smells. Also helpful since my teenage sons like to camp out on the couch with their friends on long weekends and our couch gets that fresh clean smell in an hour ."" — Kindle Customer Get it from Amazon for $123.59 . Simply fill your dirty mug with water, add a tablet, let it fizz for 15–30 minutes, and then give it a thorough rinsing before drinking from it! Promising review: ""Saw this on BuzzFeed, had to give it a try. Used it on our stainless steel coffee carafe that I have been trying to get clean for two years. The coffee stains inside just would not come out, no matter how much vinegar, dish detergent, or scrubbing I did. Until today!! Hot water and tablet in, let it sit for three hours, and UNBELIEVABLE. Where has this Bottle Bright been all my life?? I can’t wait to use it on all my travel coffee mugs. Can you please make tablets for all my cleaning needs?! This was about the easiest thing I have ever done. Love it. Highly recommend!"" — Someone Get a 12-pack from Amazon for $7.99 . Check out our Bottle Bright tablets deep dive for more incredible before-and-after pics. 👀 The kit comes with two cans of cabinet paint, a roller arm, two roller covers, and an angled paint brush. Promising review: "" Unbelievable results. This product surpassed our expectations. We were skeptical because it did not seem like enough paint. Wow, we did two coats and still have half a can left. We did prep the whole kitchen with tape and contractor protection paper. First coat went on very fast and I couldn't figure out the amount to apply, but after the first cabinet it became clear that it did not cover like the first coat of paint. It was thin like satin. When we applied the second coat, oh my gosh, it was just beautiful. We did take the doors off and painted them separately in the basement. We did no sanding, no top coat, because you do not need it. We did label the doors, which made the installation back easier. Would purchase this product again. Our neighbors cannot believe that we did the painting ourselves, because it looks professional. Transformation of our kitchen is priceless. Buy buy buy the product."" — Brad Isley Get it from Amazon for $55.98+ (available in 11 colors). I finally tried out this tool with my Crave Naturals brush , which I used for (*checks Amazon order history*) TWO YEARS without ever doing a deep clean of it. I mean, sure, I would regularly pull out the loose hair and whatever I could get to using my fingers, but there was always this gross layer at the bottom I couldn't reach, and I kind of just tried my best to pretend it wasn't there. LET ME TELL YOU: This tool is genius. With barely any effort, it pulled out that gross, years-old layer of *stuff* at the bottom of my brush (the photo above shows that layer already ~dislodged~ by the tool , right before I pulled it out), and now I don't have to feel disgusting every time I run it through my hair. It actually feels like it's doing a better job of *brushing* now too! Seriously, if you are a human with brushable hair on your head, you need this. Note: It's worth giving your hair brush a good rinse with soap after that layer of hair and lint is pulled away! I didn't find it was necessary to soak my brush before using the tool.

Carpet messes are undoubtedly the worst to clean up, but you can also use this on clothes and other surfaces like concrete and hardwood. Just be sure to follow the instructions carefully for noncarpet use. Promising review: ""I have six elderly cats, and a few of them oftentimes leave smelly pee puddles to register their disdain at whatever cats get 'peed off' about. It's not a litter box problem and, although I've caught one or two of them doing it, I can't blame them all. This product works great on fresh messes as well as dried ones. After blotting up fresh pee pods, I saturate the area with Rocco & Roxie's odor remover and let it dry. For dried stinky stuff, I just saturate the area and let it dry. It has a pleasant odor and completely eliminates the ammonia odor. Believe me, I've tried all kinds of products, and this one works the best. I buy gallons now just to have on hand. It's better than smelling that awful pee! "" — mona mia Get a 32-ounce bottle from Amazon for $23.92+ (available in two scents and a gallon size). Promising review: ""It will take one look from your friends to say 'Did you buy some new wheels?' This stuff is absolutely amazing. For the full effect, dismount your wheel, spray the back. Go do something for 10 minutes. Wash with water, no scrubbing needed. Turn the rim face up, do it again. Do the rest of your rims, and don't forget the tire protectant when you reinstall them. This stuff will handle salt, road tar, off-road dirt and mud — you get it dirty, it comes clean. Where was this stuff when I was racing off-road?"" — johnfcon Get it from Amazon for $16.99 .

BTW, this is solely for use on legs — do NOT use under your arms! Promising review: ""LOVE IT! This is now my favorite hair remover. It's so easy and comfortable to use, leaving my legs soft and smooth from top to bottom. There was no discomfort or irritation at all. Smoothly gliding around/over ankles, back of the knees, and blind curves. I have found using this is actually a relaxing experience."" — Jez Get it from Amazon for $39.99 .

This no-rinse, non-foaming toothpaste comes in a poultry flavor dogs will love. For best results, it's recommended to brush their teeth at least 2–3 times per week. Promising reviews: ""The dogs love this stuff. The picture attached is only after two weeks of use (brushing two times a day). The dogs love the flavor and actually think of tooth brushing as a treat now. I also put it in a chew toy for them to chew on to help brush their own teeth.

Read more about tea tree oil and acne at Mayo Clinic . Promising review: ""This kicked my buttne's a#$. I will say that I paired this with an antibacterial body wash (which I recommend if you have folliculitis) Background real quick: My skin is pretty sensitive and I work out 5 days a week. A bad combo for your skin, especially if you have folliculitis. Everything irritated my skin: sitting down, wearing the wrong underwear, shaving my bikini line even got irritated the next day. Summer time was always the worst. The extra sweat really clogs your pores. I have been using this for a week and a half. It did get worse for the first 3 -4 days and then all of sudden it cleared up like the sun coming out after a hard rain. I like the smell of the lotion, personally I think its a mild smell. It dries fast and doesn't stick to your clothes. I put this on in the morning and in the evening. You don't need much. Your skin is left feeling very smooth. If you have buttne, give this a try — you will not be disappointed."" — Dani Dawson Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Humble Suds is a small business based in Evergreen, Colorado, and run by moms Holli and Jennifer. My former colleague Danielle Healy swears by this stuff: ""I recently moved into a new apartment, so lately I've been cleaning A LOT. Shortly after moving in, my partner and I went to store something on the top of the kitchen cabinets only to find them caked in a thick layer of grime. 🤢 After going at it with regular multipurpose cleaner (with little success), we broke out the scour paste as a last-ditch effort and OH BOY did this miracle product deliver (pics above). If it can handle that grossness, it's going to have no problem with day-to-day messes like soap scum and burnt-on food. Plus, it smells delightful and comes in minimal, low-waste packaging!"" Promising review : ""Buyer beware: Don’t buy just one!! Learn from my mistake, and buy at least two jars because this stuff is INCREDIBLE. I used it on my textured shower floor. It was EASIER to clean and required less scrubbing than any other product I’ve used , including CLR. If you have black matte bathroom fixtures, this is the stuff you need. My shower and sink drains look brand new. My other favorite part about this scour paste, is the fact that I don’t need to use any paper towels. Just a wet rag to wipe it all down at the end.

To use, you just apply a thin layer twice a day (morning and night) to the affected area and under the edge of the nail for a week — after that, switching to applying once per day at night. Promising review : “I tried EVERYTHING! I tried tree tea oil for years and various different products. Nothing worked. The reviews were so great on this that I decided to try to cure it one more time. But when you have had a condition for 35 years, you aren’t too hopeful! I followed the suggestions of some of the reviewers and cut my toenails (I only had it on my big toes) everywhere that the fungus was present. Even below the quick. I started applying this gel, which is super easy to use. I swear to you that I noticed a difference after one application. ” — WIAPilot Get it from Amazon for $16.97 .

But, as soon as I got my hands on a bottle of this stuff (regular Dawn is my go-to dish soap, BTW), I put it to use on both a saucepan I used to make homemade enchilada sauce *and* the casserole dish I baked those enchiladas, which had a ton of caked-on food.

I'm talking hard, white texture that you cannot scratch off at all! For two years.

Promising review: ""I have well water. Something in my well water reacts with copper plumbing and turns my shower tiles blue.

I've tried dozens and dozens of cleaners and scrubbed till my arms ached trying to get ahead of the blue and scumminess . My ambition in life is NOT to be a full time bathroom scrubber! I saw this stuff on a professional house cleaner's TikTok (sorry, don't remember which one) and thought 'what the heck, might as well give it a try.' Oh my goodness, the first day after my shower I sprayed this stuff all over and walked away. The next morning there was a NOTICEABLE reduction in the blue and the glass looked clearer too. Day two, sprayed again and walked away. The next morning the blue was gone except for a few spots on the floor tile and the glass looked amazing. Day three I sprayed the remaining spots and the next morning the shower practically looked new. NO SCRUBBING AT ALL!!!! This is my new favorite shower cleaner.

It also self-propels so you just need to steer, no hard pushing! Promising review: ""I confess I can be a lackadaisical housekeeper, which is problematic since my new dog sheds enough in a week for me to build an entire new dog. What's worse, vacuuming doesn't pick up a lot of his fur. This Tineco is magic, though. Not only does it pick everything up (dust, fur, hair, crumbs, Nature's Miracle, errant Cheerios), but because the wheels are motorized, vacuuming/mopping is a breeze. I get exhausted using my canister vac, but this thing is a blast to use. Here is what I've learned: I always use the 'extra water' feature, which seems to work better. I clean the dirty water holder and parts every time I empty it, and I run the self-clean cycle after every second emptying session. This means I can do my primary bath and my 10x12 TV room before self-cleaning and recharging for a little bit. Or I can do my kitchen, entryway, and hall before self-cleaning, or my living room. In other words, you're not going to do your whole house on one battery charge or without running the self-cleaning feature several times. Of course, the reason you have to run the self-cleaning so often is because this little beauty is picking up So. Much. Stuff. It's magic.

Promising review : ""This is by far my favorite kitchen appliance. So quick and easy to use. Literally just pop in the batteries, then put it on the can and push the button. When it's done, push the button for a second longer, and it will stop, and also grab the lid. Aside from how easy this is to use, what I love about it is that it literally cuts the whole top part of the can with the lid and not just the lid . I say this because other can openers will open the can from the side, but this one takes off the whole top, which leaves no sharp edges and no dirty 'top of the can' gunk to get in your food.

Promising review: ""I seriously can't believe how well these little tablets work. I had the most disgusting Hydro Flask coffee mug; I tried everything — bottle brush, different kinds of soap, vinegar, EVERYTHING — and there was still a seemingly impenetrable layer of black sludge inside. It grossed me out so much that I bought ANOTHER Hydro Flask to replace it. Eventually they both got black inside, so I tried these little magic tablets. I let a tablet sit in each of my mugs for an hour or two, and the black sludge rinsed out COMPLETELY, without even scrubbing. They look brand-new. What a magical product. No weird smell or taste afterward, either. AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING."" — Amazon Customer Get a set of 12 from Amazon for $7.99 . Check out a TikTok of the SneakErasers in action. Promising review : ""I have a couple of pairs of sneakers I stopped wearing because they started looking a bit grungy.

I cleaned two pairs of shoes and could not believe the results! Awesome."" — Spencer Get a three-pack from Amazon for $9.97 (available in three set sizes). Promising review: ""My girlfriend bought this for me as a present. At first I was skeptical to use, but once I got my hands on it, there was no going back. I use my Beard Bib anywhere two to four times a week and cannot live without it. Not only does this serve a big purpose in my trimming routine, but now I no longer have to argue with my girlfriend about all the mess that I USED to create. Also, we ordered a beard oil recently and reached out to customer support about the different scents they offer, they were super helpful! Overall, it has been an awesome experience and they’ve truly made me feel like a King!"" — Timur Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three colors and two styles). Check out a TikTok of the grape cutter in action. Promising review : ""When we went to search Amazon for 'grape cutters,' I was worried that we may have hit rock bottom. My wife and I found ourselves dreading the process every time our daughter wanted a handful of grapes. We bought this little gadget with low expectations and fully anticipated using it two times before throwing it in our kitchen drawer where it would inevitably sit for a year before we threw it away. Boy were we wrong. It only took one use before we realized that what we thought would be another useless novelty, was actually a parent's HOLY GRAIL of food preparation. No joke, I literally used it the other day to cut THREE grapes for MYSELF, just for the enjoyment."" — Michael Get it from Amazon for $11.76 . Promising review: ""I hadn’t worn my gorgeous bracelet in years because I could no longer handle the tiny clasp which I used to be able to do before. But now I’m 81, and my fingers are no longer as nimble. I was able to put my bracelet on. It really works. My bracelet is real solid gold, and I did not think that the clamp would hurt the bracelet. I did not see any indication as to that effect . I’m very pleased with this gadget."" — ilsa mayer Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in seven colors). Promising review : ""Where has this been all my life? I’m the type of person that wears 2–3 necklaces at one time and within 30 minutes, they’re all tangled up, ripping the hairs out of the back of my neck, so on and so forth. I also don’t like to take my necklaces off when I travel, so they stay on my neck, jumbled until I get home. Now that I have this, I literally open the clasp and set my necklaces down, and then I put it right back on, and because they’re all separated on the clasp, they don’t get tangled at all! "" — Valincia price Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in three colors, two styles, and multipacks). This small business was seen on Shark Tank , and the founder, Kim, wanted a painless solution for lugging all her grocery bags in after shopping. Promising review : ""These are great for consolidating trips to the car/truck to carry in items . I only have one functional hand, so it used to take forever to bring items into the house. Now, I just load up four or five bags onto the click-and-carry grip carrier, and off I go. Easy to use as the handle turns counter or clockwise direction, and you just turn it back in place until you hear the click sound, which indicates it's locked in place. I've had these for about a year now, and they haven't worn out or broken yet, so I'm extremely happy with them."" — Susan Hardee Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in seven colors).

I have used multiple degreaser sprays, but they don't work for me. The Magic Eraser was OK, but I used several at a time, and I had to scrub so hard. But this product, oh my goodness, is legit a miracle. It doesn't have any type of smell.

Check out our full Puracy Natural Stain Remover review . Promising review: "" This is the holy grail of spot removers! It’s beyond amazing. I have been able to save shirts that I thought were ruined. Stains that looked permanent and were even set in the dryer still came out. My son’s white chef jacket had barbecue stains, ketchup, and whatnot on it — it took several applications but looks white again. This spot remover is a keeper, I have bought bottles for both of my grown kids cause it’s so darn good."" — Linda Fairchild Get it from Amazon for $16.99 . Promising review: "" This is one of my favorite purchases I’ve ever made. I have a very hairy dog and was sick of having to vacuum all the time. This little guy has solved that issue entirely! Before running it the first time, I did a very thorough vacuum of all the carpet and hard flooring and have used this vacuum daily since, and it has saved me so much time and effort! I clean out all of the filters and roller brush weekly to make sure it doesn’t get clogged up with dust and hair. The roller brush is super easy to remove and clean as well. The first couple of times I used it, it seemed to wander the house aimlessly, but it quickly figured out and ideal path and really does get every nook and cranny."" — Best purchase ever!

Get it from Amazon for $18.95+ (available in various brush stiffnesses). Promising review: "" I took a chance and bought this originally as a 'Band-Aid fix' to refinish a desk . I had looked in stores in the contact paper aisles, but all of them were just that...paper. THIS item is actually a thin sheet of vinyl with adhesive, and I ended up liking it so much that I bought more and refinished my kitchen countertop with it as well! Highly recommended if you want to change the look of your counters but you don't have the money for a full remodel just yet. It can be cleaned with dish soap and water just like a real countertop."" — Z Get it from Amazon for $5.10+ (available in 10 sizes and five colors). Promising review: ""I used this to clean up and condition the railing near our front door/foyer.

I used it in my dishwasher. Had standing water on the bottom, dropped one tablet in the water. Put it on light wash cycle and at the end of the cycle, the water was gone!

It's awesome."" — Ben W Get a two-pack from Amazon for $34.99 (available in four styles). Promising review: ""Holy cow! I never thought my stained grout would look so good! These pens are so amazing. After a little priming, they go forever! They cover very well and are super easy to use and cover the darkest of stains! I am buying four more to cover the rest of the house. The tip does not get into the very end of a line due to the border, but I prime it a bit for excess paint and push it in with my finger. Also, this is great for those deep small holes or grooves that are in the tile that leave dirt spots that are almost impossible to get out. Just prime it over the hole and rub it in with your finger and wipe off the rest. I have very light beige tile, and the beige color pens blend perfectly. I would NOT recommend white unless you have very white tile. This beige will blend well with white as well. Cannot beat it for the price and the amazing job this pen does. One pen will cover about a 3x20-foot area, no problem."" — NatJH Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes and in additional colors ). Promising review: ""This product is awesome! We bought one in the office to stop a nearby chair from continuously hitting the outlet plugs. It solved the problem right away. So we ordered three more to use anywhere there is bulk on the wall.

Promising review: ""I LOVE how beautiful these are, like hand-painted beads on my little one's closet doors. They look great on a soft sage green background. There's a tiny bit of texture in the paint which you can see through the decal at the right angle, but most often guests assume I painted them myself! The smoother the surface the better, but I would definitely buy these again."" — Alexis Get a pair from Amazon for $9.50 .

Definitely recommend it!"" — Nikki Get it from Amazon for $37.97+ (available in four colors).

Since then, the brand has evolved into an e-commerce business that creates and distributes high-quality cleaning products. They're great for windows or any glassware, too! Promising review : ""I couldn't get my windows clean using cleaning solution, newsprint, and a lot of elbow grease. There were always streaks and dirt left behind. Enter these things. One quick cleaning, and I do mean quick, and my windows are now cleaner than any windows I've ever cleaned. It's simply amazing. We were all standing around in utter shock and delight before running around trying the cloths on other stuff: the TV, the picture glass, etc. I know it sounds corny, but I couldn't wait to get up this morning, because I woke up in the middle of the night excitedly thinking about trying it on the car today.

The plastic collar enables you to hold the cup without squeezing it or burning your hands on the hot walls of the cup. There is enough volume in the cup to allow for the 12-ounce brew plus ample creamer. It's not a stainless vacuum cup, but it does hold its temperature better than your typical gas station or coffee shop cup. Plus you have the advantage of being able to reheat your drink in the microwave which you can't do with a stainless cup. — ViciousCycle Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in three sizes/styles and 29 colors). Promising review: ""I got this lil' guy to illuminate my desk when our office started getting dark around 4 PM. I have gotten SO many compliments on him. People love the fact that he's squishy, and that his little legs are floppy. And, of course, how can you beat the thousand-yard-stare of this little duck who has clearly given up on everything? The battery life is so-so, but luckily the USB-C port is the same as my laptop charger, so I can just charge it on my desk during the day, and turn it on in the afternoon/evening. He's a squishy, depressed duck. What's not to love?"" — Caitlyn Get it from Amazon for $13.56 (available in two other styles). Promising review: ""I am not sure why everyone doesn't own blue light reducing glasses. These should be as essential as toilet paper.

Just what I needed."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $109+ (available in five styles).

It clips on easily, adjusts easily (my cat will come up and rub against it putting it out of whack)."" — Robin M. Padon Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in three styles).

I recommend this to anyone like me who needs a cool place for their notes. You will be the envy of your coworkers!"" — Avid Dancer Get it from Amazon for $5.97+ (available in two styles). Promising review: ""It’s much more spacious than it looks. It’s very sleek and stylish. I use it as my work bag and I find that it looks professional and has enough space for all of my stuff. I carry a laptop, pencil case, two books, makeup bag, water bottle, wallet, lotion, phone and laptop charger, and other small miscellaneous objects . Still plenty of space. And when you see carry it, it doesn’t feel bulky or cumbersome. The bag does sag a bit after use. But has held up to wear and tear. I would recommend.

I've been wearing it for over a month now and in the beginning I tried to take it off when doing dishes, showering, and washing my hands. After about two weeks I just decided to leave it on and it has been fine. I never take it off, the ring is true to size. It's not too thin or thick, feels great on, and it is durable.

I will never use anything else! I do use the Anua Pore Control Cleansing Oil first and then use this cleanser after and have noticed a HUGE improvement!

The charge on these goes for at least four hours (I haven't tried it beyond that yet), and the Bluetooth connects to my devices super easily. Excellent pair of headphones for the price point."" Promising review : ""I really like these headphones. The noise cancellation isn’t 100% but it’s pretty close. The color is really cute and music comes through really clear. Calls are good as well.

I have combination skin, it is pretty sensitive and prone to breakouts and I have large clogged pores on mostly my nose and chin. I noticed after several weeks that my skin was getting so much smoother and my pores were shrinking . My skin feels as smooth as glass and many fine lines are diminishing, as well as my pores.

I immediately put on the watch as soon as I opened it up; It fits comfortably and the band wasn’t too small, which I was a little concerned about. I’ll definitely be looking to purchase other styles of this watch. Great buy, especially for the price!"" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in eight colors). Lulu Candles is a US-based small business that specializes in scented candles and perfumes. Promising review : ""I was staying over at a friend's house and sitting next to her coffee table. She had this candle on the table and even though it wasn't lit I could smell it, and it was so delicious that I instantly went online to find it and bought it for myself! If this came in a perfume I would buy enough to last the rest of my life. I don't know how to even explain the scent but if you are an amber/patchouli/vanilla fan, this is absolutely for you. The jasmine adds an unbelievable freshness without a flowery scent . I even bought the shampoo and conditioner which I will probably use as more of a body wash and shaving cream but that is how desperate I am to get this scent on me!"" — Melissa I. Get it from Amazon for $19.95+ (available in six sizes, in gift box options, in packs of two, and in a variety of scents). Emma also has this: ""Hello, that is my face above, because I bought into the hype of all the 5-star reviews and now I will never look back!! Putting it on is like giving my eyelashes butterfly wings. It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time."" Promising review : ""Saw this product on TikTok and thought it would be expensive looking at the results they got. I am beyond amazed with how my lashes look after about two coats. For around $5 you couldn’t ask for a better mascara! I will be buying this same one when I run out. I was not expecting to like it as much as I do! No complaints."" — Kd Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown and a pack of three). Promising review: ""At first, I was a little skeptical — I have been wanting to find a Skims-like material shirt for a while but didn't want to pay the price of one lol, and this shirt feels amazing. I will be getting one in every color now."" — Julianne Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in women's sizes XXS–3XL and 33 colors). Promising reviews : ""I have several pair of Rothy’s in a very similar style to these, and they are actually just as comfortable right out of the box as Rothy’s…maybe more so . I also purchased in black. LOVE THEM!!"" — Amazon Customer ""I couldn’t be happier with these flats! As a result of them dropping in price, I purchased four pairs in varying colors to wear with jeans and sweaters. Not only do they look cute, but they are also decently padded and comfortable. I have been buying Vivaia flats for over $100 and these look just as good and are more comfortable to wear ."" — PSK Get it from Amazon for $32.99 (available in women's sizes 6–10 and 14 colors and patterns). Promising review : ""I was actually curious if this was actually going to work and if it would look cheap, but it's well made, sturdy, and looks pretty cool. You can use other liquor bottles. Don't be fooled by the empty bottle and lack of weight. I tried full bottles of unopened wine, and it's held up really well. For the price point, you can't beat it, and you will definitely get lots of compliments!"" — KGP Get it from Amazon for $17.90 (available in four styles).

Promising review: ""I truly enjoyed these shower steamers. They smell divine, and not only that , but they each come with a personalized affirmation and they describe what each one is intended for . I love the personalized letter from the creator Helen. I will order again and I will be telling my family and friends to order this as well. I started feeling much more calmer after just smelling them."" — Amazon Customer Get a pack of six from Amazon for $12.99 (available in three styles). The weights are covered with a sweatproof, skin-friendly silicone layer that's comfortable, and the adjustable elastic band helps you get the right fit. You can even remove weights as well if needed! Promising review : ""I love these! So great for yoga or mat Pilates. I like that they are 2 pounds each, which is the perfect weight, and you can even take off weight as well. I use them every week for my workouts. Very durable band as well!"" — Robyn Get a pair from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes and 14 colors). Check out a TikTok of the cheese slicer in action. Promising review: ""My mother-in-law had purchased one last year and I tried hers at Christmas and fell in love with how easy it was to use. We have a lot of get togethers with friends and cheese is a staple appetizer in our house. So I purchased my own and have been using it weekly since. It cuts easily and it's mostly easy to clean. Sometimes cheese gets stuck in the crack but some scrubbing with a small brush usually does the trick."" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $15.62 (available in two colors). Promising review : ""Sparkling and beautiful. I bought these to hang in my kitchen window, and they are perfect. The sun hits the crystals, and it creates a beautiful shine and radiance. I've received lots of compliments. Nice buy!"" — Alicia Burciaga Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in six styles). Promising reviews: ""I have 4c hair and was looking for a protein treatment for my thin and fragile hair. I had recently used a product in my hair that had so much alcohol in it; that wreaked havoc on my hair, leaving it pretty damaged. I was very skeptical about this product because I have never seen anyone with my hair type use it. Boy was I wrong to doubt this product, it left my hair looking and feeling beautiful. I highly recommend it to anyone natural or with curly hair. "" — Therese-Claire ""I have super fine, blonde hair. I’ve ran through likely hundreds of different hair masks and leave in conditioners over the years, only to have them cling to my hair like nothing else, often leaving it feeling waxy and heavy. After a few rounds of clarifying shampoo, I reached for this stuff and it legit brought my hair back from the grave. Even with my hair being extremely fine, it leaves it soft, glossy, and gorgeous! I know some people have said they’re not a fan of the smell, but I find it to be super light and refreshing. Could not recommend this stuff enough!!"" — Soph Get it from Amazon for $7.62 . Promising review: ""Absolutely beautiful! High quality. Really adds drama to a wall/ room. Little details really do matter!"" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $4.98+ (available in six configurations and two pack options). Promising review: ""These slippers are amazing! Discovered them on TikTok and went back and forth about ordering them but wow, they are so comfortable. I have barely taken them off since receiving them.

Sillage refers to the trail of scent that lingers in the air after someone wearing perfume passes by. Promising review: ""Like so many, I found this scent on TikTok. I was a bit skeptical at first but finally got around to trying it. First off, this scent smells amazing! Almost every time I've worn it, I receive compliments. It has a sweet smell, almost like warm cake or sugar cookies with a hint of lemon . With such an affordable price, I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about trying it."" — Chrissy Get it from Amazon for $4.50 . Promising reviews: ""Used this bag for all of my dog's things on a cross-country move. We stayed in multiple hotels and did not have any issues with ripping or anything getting broken.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/audreyworboys/disney-treasure-royal-caribbean-ovation-review,travel,,"I Experienced Both Disney And Royal Caribbean Cruises, And Let Me Tell You Which One Actually Felt Like A Vacation",20,517,8,10,"Two completely different cruises for two completely different price points and personality types. BuzzFeed Staff While BuzzFeed was provided these trips free of charge, we were under no obligation to give a positive review. Being able to drive from my house before sailing and to my house after sailing on Ovation was a huge perk. The jet lag to and from the Treasure was tough on us, and I felt like we spent a whole day recovering. I've also sailed on the Disney Wonder out of San Diego, and we drove to the port and had to fly back when the cruise ended in Vancouver, and I will say it wasn't hard on our bodies at all. I really think it's the time change. Now, I'm a vegetarian, and I felt like there was more I enjoyed at Marceline Market as opposed to Windjammer. That being said, I did enjoy eating at both; I just felt like there were more substantial options in the Treasure . Windjammer also had longer hours than Marceline did, which was really nice because lunch time tends to be nap time for my 2-year-old, so we missed lunch a couple of times on the Treasure , so we had to go to one of the walk-up food places by the pool (which was still good). You can see the vibe of the stateroom floors is really different between the ships. Disney's Treasure feels very organic and magical while Royal Caribbean's feels like an upscale posh resort. A little note: Kids aren't allowed in pools on either ship unless they're potty-trained. We potty-trained between the cruises, and while there would've been more pools my son was eligible to go in on the Treasure than Ovation , the pools on the Treasure were kinda crowded and in direct sun, so I'm not sure we would've done them anyway. He liked the splash pad, though! Both also had a nursery. We didn't do either because my toddler is the human version of velcro. Also, we ordered a margarita from the Bionic Bar and the pool bar, and they tasted the same! One thing I love about cruises is because it's the same cast of passengers and crew on board, you really do end up feeling like a big family. You see the same people the same day, and a lot of passengers bring little gifts and treats to hand out to others. For example, we've found rubber ducks that other passengers have hidden around the ship with notes to keep or rehide. People also make their own door magnets to decorate their door AND put on doors they like to compliment them, like ""We like your door"" or ""best on the floor."" On Disney , I've even seen guests hang little mailboxes outside their door where other guests will drop off stickers, crafts, pencils, etc. It's like a big elementary school Valentine's party. We look forward to being a part of this subculture whenever we cruise. FWIW, a seven-night cruise in a balcony suite for the Treasure for a family of four starts at $7,244.",2025-06-24T17:49:25.894125+00:00

BuzzFeed Contributor ""Hobbiton is pretty much paying 120 bucks a head to look at some grass, then go to a Lord Of The Rings-themed pub, I get it if you're a LOTR megafan visiting NZ, but for me it was just so underwhelming for the cost. We also have a tourist attraction about 2 hours away from me called 'Taumatawhakatangihangakoauauotamateaturipukakapikimaungahoronukupokaiwhenuakitanatahu', which is famous for being the longest place name in the world. People drive there to take photos with the sign with the name. I drove to it, and it turns out it's just a hill. Not even a special hill or anything, not like a tourist attraction type hill, just a normal ass hill. The bit I hated, though? No bloody sign lmao. they removed the long ass sign everyone took pictures with, so now its literally just a two hour drive to see a hill. I don't even know why that hill even has a name in the first place tbh lol."" –YaboiMarkizzle –OppositionGuerilla –Chino_Kawaii ""Anywhere you go, you get drunken, loud groups of people ruining everyone else's time. And most places have also adapted to cater to these groups, so the quality has gone down as well... it's a shame because I love the city, but when I was there last year, I kept thinking 'oh well, looks like there's no point in coming back.'"" –Tattoo-oottaT –kaysmilex3 ""There isn't even time to take your own photos, the guide takes your camera/phone from you and snaps the classic photos. If you pay extra, you can get a few minutes to take your own pictures at the 'perfect' time of day. Tours are literally timed to the minute and can be disorienting. With dust falling on your head from above and being kicked up from the ground by other tourists, it's hard to breathe. Just all around unpleasant. I understand it has received the hug of death from tourists worldwide and therefore needs to be heavily regulated. I get it, and I'm glad for the income it provides to the native population nearby. But it was not worth the time, trouble, and money IMO. I have fab photos but no pride in them. I recommend The Wave instead. It's also heavily regulated, but the permitted crowd size is small and the long hike puts a lot of people off."" –mzskunk ""First off, the ads for the Animal Kingdom lodge are nothing but lies. You will be nowhere near the animals , and most of them stay as far away as possible. The rides across all the parks are pretty terrible, with a few exceptions. The crowds are insane. Everything is so expensive and just flat out not worth it. Don’t even get me started on the character dining experiences. Universal Studios is much better if you like rides."" –Tangboy50000 ""There aren’t really any remaining public beaches anymore; nearly every square inch is occupied by inclusive resorts and private beach clubs. A protected wildlife reserve south of Tulum is being destroyed to build more of these. Sewage/waste from this overdevelopment is being dumped into the cenotes (natural underground water sources), and the local population has been forced into poverty. Prices for going out are those of major US and European cities. The infrastructure in the area is crumbling, and there’s a lot of cartel/dirty cop/scam taxi activity because of the yuppies that party on drugs in the beach clubs. The government looks the other way because a lot of money is being pumped out of the tourists. Super sad to see, it’s surprising that people can travel to this area and simply look the other way while enjoying a lavish vacation."" –ClaireClover ""Food was almost all mid fast food. Hooters, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. People were nice, but the place was so boring. Went for the Big 10 basketball tourney. The city didn't even seem to notice. If there were any outside events, they were not promoted. Even the venue was lame. And the food there was worse than 7-11. Way worse. Like, middle school cafeteria free food bad. I feel sorry for Pacers fans."" –Key-Article6622 ""One sewer grate was spewing up into the street, we got harassed at least twice on every subway ride, and the cafe we visited served our breakfast in a puddle of oil. The people there are miserable and angry; even in Central Park, you see the skyscrapers looming over the tree lines, reminding you that you're caged, and every surface is covered in graffiti from people trying to prove they exist before the city consumes them. All this under the watch of a thousand waving flags. It's the least human place I've ever seen."" –Clomeaway ""The archaeology museum was nice, and I asked someone there if they felt like tourists were ruining their island. She agreed. I cannot even imagine how bad it is now with cruise ships. Cruise ships ruin everything, in my opinion. There have been places I’ve gone to five years ago off-season in Europe that were lovely, and you could have an authentic experience. Nowadays, they are just packed and miserable with obnoxious tourists."" –hoppyrules –chocolatechipninja –FinancialSurround385 ""I was grabbed and partially hennaed against my will in front of police and forced to pay a ridiculous amount of money with a threat of harm if I didn't pay, despite me not agreeing to this and trying to run away. I travel well and extensively, having been brought up in the Mediterranean, so I'm used to haggling/bartering and somewhat intrusive social engagements. This was not that."" –xwigglex ""Then we spent a whole week inside the resort because the people working there said it was too dangerous for the ladies in the group to walk into town. We just left for the beach right in front, and it was full of seaweed. The resort itself was great. Good food, good people, and lots of activities, though. Then, a month after we got back, terrorists invaded the resort with machine guns and killed a bunch of people. We saw pictures of dead bodies in the exact place we were sitting the month before. No, thanks."" –relakas ""I got food poisoning first day (ate at Pizza Hut the rest of the time out of fear), saw cats jumping up and licking spoons and the servery at a buffet, and could only drink bottled water. When I went to the men's room at (what I was told was) an up-market shopping location, I had to flush the toilet with a bucket, and then, when I went to wash my hands, I saw a guy next to me washing his balls in the sink.

Like finding a unicorn. These are a unicorn! They are the single most comfortable pair of pants I've ever worn and fully intend to order more in other colors over the coming weeks and months. They fit perfectly, cling without being stifling, just enough to be comfortable. I cannot recommend these strongly enough. The material is so soft and breathable. They aren't warm, I'll give you that, so definitely wear them when it's seasonally appropriate, but so comfortable I'll freeze happily."" — Danika Brennen Get it from Amazon for $19.75+ (available in sizes XS–5XL and 31 colors/patterns). Promising review: ""These shorts are wonderful, comfy, and durable. I recently went on vacation, and these were my go-to shorts."" — Onlythebestwilldo Get them from Torrid for $15 (originally $55, available in sizes 10–30 Promising review: ""Absolutely love it, I have it in three colors. It is extremely soft and comfortable. It has invisible pockets on both sides of the shorts located under the skirt, which are very useful. It is perfect for sports or just to be comfortable and look great during the day. Runs true to size."" — Ara Baby Get it from Amazon for $31.99 (available in sizes XS–XL and 12 colors). Promising review: ""Comfortable and cute. Great fit. Nice color. Very soft."" — Reviewer Get it from Nordstrom for $63.70 (originally $98, available in sizes 25–31). Promising review: ""This shirt was recommended to me by a Madewell employee, and let me put you on: this is THE shirt. It is a heavier-weight cotton than most shirts, so it lasts forever, the colors are more vibrant than the pictures (I got every color but white, that's how obsessed I am). Effortlessly stylish and so comfortable."" — FrancescaCS Get it from Madewell for $19.99+ (originally $42+, available in sizes XXS–XXL and in 14 colors/patterns) Promising reviews: ""This 'fit is for all around! Lightweight, color is fab, and it fits great. Perfect travel outfit — able to wear pieces separately. It may get wrinkly, but that’s a quick fix, tumbling it in the dryer for a short time. Not transparent at all, fabric is soft, and it's an awesome value."" — VA ""Such good value for the price. I purchase a size up to wear during pregnancy and will likely live in this postpartum. It’s so soft, comfortable, and doesn’t shrink in the wash.

It also saved us from paying the overweight fees, which is easy to carry, to make sure your bags are under the required weight limit.

Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Everything you could possibly need for a Disney Parks day (minus the Mickey ice cream bar). BuzzFeed Staff This crossbody is pretty much the perfect size you need for your theme park adventures — and it's definitely the first thing you need. A big mistake I see people make at the park is one of two things: either bringing an oversized backpack packed to the brim with things or not bringing any bag at all. Now, I know most people's first instinct is to bring the largest backpack they own, but frankly, those people quickly realize how big of a mistake it is after their first day of walking all day long in the Florida heat carrying wayyyy too many pounds on their shoulders. Plus, huge backpacks are super annoying to bring onto rides, since at Disney you need to place the bag at your feet (large items will not fit comfortably), and at Universal, you need to place any bag into a locker (which are pretty small and only fit small bags, like this one). This bag is pretty much the perfect size because it can comfortably slip into a Universal locker, and it's a good size to place at your feet on a Disney ride without getting super annoyed midway through the coaster. It's large enough to hold all your essentials — and has a space for your bottle and umbrella (both are must-haves in Florida). Promising review : "" This bag was helpful during our trip to Disneyland . We put our super important things, like phones, wallets, keys, etc., in the bag and left our diaper bag with our stroller while we went on rides. It gave us peace of mind knowing we had our important items with us and that they were secured on me. The bag was super comfortable to wear and easy to take on and off. And knowing I can use this bag again for similar situations makes me even happier I bought it. If you’re on the fence, buy this bag! You won’t regret it! "" — HalesComet Promising review : ""Bought this before going to Universal Studios Orlando and the Theme Parks with the purpose of utilizing this to hold extra power banks, water, and other small items such as a poncho, beanie, and snacks. Let me tell you - it is definitely a must-have. Got to wear it on most rides, instead of placing it in the lockers, saving valuable time."" — Abbas Qureshi Get it from Amazon for $23.74+ (available in 20 colors). One size fits all, and according to reviewers, it can fit up to size 5X. As a Florida native, let me let you in on a little secret — the weather app lies, and it's liable to rain at any moment, even if it says clear skies all day. You're definitely gonna need a poncho, because nothing ruins a vacation like not being prepared during a random thunderstorm. Allow me to paint you a (word) picture of a scene I personally witnessed at least once a week: It's a hot day, Magic Kingdom is packed, and tourists are happily walking about. You're checking your Disney Experience app and trying to make it to the Haunted Mansion line while the wait time is still manageable. All of a sudden, with literally zero warning, rain begins to fall. All of a sudden, rather than leisurely walking toward your ride, you're instead running for cover into the closest gift shop — along with about a hundred other people. Now you're waiting inside this shop, literally packed to the brim, just waiting for the rain to finally halt. You're at the mercy of the Florida skies. Meanwhile, the locals and the tourists in the know just calmly take out this oversized poncho (which covers everything and leaves you dry), and lazily walk to their next ride (especially now that the wait time will be like five mins). Promising review : "" Perfect for theme park visits! The zip front is an excellent feature, so you're not having to peel off a wet raincoat when it stops raining . The pocket is great for keeping your phone, and the carry pouch for the poncho in. The hood is also nice and roomy to cover Minnie's ears, but also has a nice elastic drawstring. Best pre-vacay purchase!! "" — Natalie Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in 31 colors). The hardest part about tackling the parks, no matter what time of year, is the fact that Orlando is perpetually hot, hot, hot! 🔥 The summer is even worse. You're gonna be waiting in outdoor lines a lottt more often than you would assume in both Disney and Universal, and trust me when I say that the sun can be brutal. Having these on hand for you and your family is actually a must. Just wet the towels at any water fountain (they can be found all over the parks, even in long, outdoor lines), wring them out, and place them on your neck and face to cool down. Make sure you're getting a towel for each member of the family, especially the little ones who are bound to overheat. Promising review : ""These were wonderful for my trip to Disney World! We had just gotten back and I’m so glad I got these! Definitely keeps you cool and is lightweight and a MUST for a trip to Disney during the hot summer months or if u are going to be out in the heat for anything!"" — Amazon Customer Promising review : ""Great price, got four for just a dollar more than getting one was at the last location I looked online. They come in a waterproof pouch, you can keep a little water in so it always stays wet. And they’re quite long, so they can wrap around your head and neck or hang around your neck and still have lengths to wipe around your face and head. Great for our Disney World trip ."" — Cassandra Get it from Amazon for $11.69+ (available in 10 colors and multipack options). Alright, so I love my Mickey ears just as much as the next person, but after a while, they can start irritating or hurting your head just a bit. Especially if you're gonna be wearing them all day long. Now let me tell you, because of the shape of the ears or headband, it makes for an awkward fit in your bag, and you could risk messing them up if you try to stuff them in. This clip, meanwhile, shows the world that you're a theme park master. They keep the ears on hand for the times you want to quickly put them on for a pic, and then you can just clip them back onto your bag when you're tired of wearing them. Honestly, you're gonna need this. Orange Blossom Home is a small business in Winter Garden, Florida. They sell a wide variety of Disney-inspired products and customizable home decor. Promising review : ""Love being able to hang the ears on my bag so they don't get squished in my purse."" — Cheryl LeBlanc Get it from Orange Blossom Home on Etsy for $11+ (available in 44 patterns and customization options). The sun is brutal, and you need sunglasses — but trust me, you don't want to bring along your expensive, designer pair when they're liable to get scratched or lost in the chaos that is a theme park vacation. These are polarised, so they're perfect for blocking out the sun and they're cheap and come in value packs, so you can wear them on board the ride with zero fear of them accidentally flying off. Promising review : ""Took these to Disney, as we all know the sun is brutal there. I have always had a hard time, even with glasses on, not squinting. I did not have to squint with these. I will buy them again. Great price for the quality."" — Eileen Ashenfelter Get it from Amazon for $10.39+ (available in 10 colors, plus value packs of two and three). Say hello to the one thing I never leave my home without. There's literally no way I would even attempt to head to a theme park without this fan on hand. It doesn't matter that I've lived my entire life in Orlando, and I should be used to the heat by now, nope. There's no way I'm leaving my house without this. It's small enough to fit in most of my pockets, and the charge lasts foreverrrr. Like, I use this through most of my day without needing to recharge. Plus, on the days I somehow forget my portable charger at home, this doubles as one! Promising review : ""I love this! I brought this on a trip to Disney back in September, and it was still hot most of those days . I was able to pack this in my mini backpack with no problems. It didn't take up hardly any room, and the battery life was excellent! We were at Disney for about a week, and I may have charged it once or twice the entire time! It definitely came in handy when we were waiting in the sun in the long lines ."" — Danielle N Lee Get it from Amazon for $15.29+ (available in six colors). If you have kids and a stroller, don't even attempt braving the theme parks without this fan. I use it all day long while walking outdoors. It has three different levels of speed, and even has a built-in LED light when I wanna distract my daughter. It's way too hot out for babies, especially during the summer, and a stroller fan is often something we forget to pack because it's easy to underestimate just how hot it can get for the little ones. I have this on my stroller all year long for my daughter, even if I'm not going to a theme park. Promising review : ""This fan keeps my son nice and cool, even in the hot Florida summer . The big kicker is that when I took it to Disney, it lasted the whole day with only one recharge . It’s really easy to use as well: just a simple push button to select the fan speed and light. I actually bought a second one for my jogging stroller so I can keep the other on the big stroller. Highly recommend. "" — Reed Mason Get it from Amazon for $22.49 (available in blue and black). The year is 2019, and Disney World has completely banned plastic straws and switched to the paper ones that melt into my Coke the second it touches the liquid. It's awful. Annual passholder groups on Facebook (and everywhere else) are in an uproar. People are asking Disney to switch back, and there are mass debates over it. Regardless, the paper straws are there to stay. Because of this, I always make sure I bring along these reusable straws because nothing ruins my perfect ice cream float like the taste of a paper straw. Trust me, you're going to thank me. Promising review : ""Disney only has paper straws now. I fully understand why they changed, but I hate paper straws. These are wonderful. They clip into your bag. They are adjustable, so kids' smaller drinks are no problem. And the cleaning wand is well made."" — Tonya F Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in six color packs). After a day (or days) of walking under the Florida sun and sweating everywhere, you're gonna be begging for this anti-chafe cream. It does a great job in protecting your skin from the awful rubbing and chafing that is sure to occur after a long day of walking in the heat. Promising review : "" If you are going on a Disney trip, BUY THIS. I will never not have this in hand on our WDW vacations. Get the feet to glide one, too, while you’re at it . If you have thighs that rub (or….are a dude) this is going to save you from feeling like your stuff is on fire after walking that average of 8 miles a day at Magic Kingdom . Put this in your cart: seriously! If I could give this infinity stars, I would!"" — JSandlin08 Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in three sizes and multipacks). This balm is ~wonderfall~. Getting a blister puts a damper on your vacation super fast, especially when you still have several more days of theme parking to get to. I apply this balm liberally to my heel, and it works wonders in reducing my chances of getting blisters — a must-have when I have a full day of walking ahead of me. Promising review : ""Used this product on our last trip to Disney, where we walked an average of 9–10 miles each day for several days. IT WORKED! I did not come home with a single blister or sore toe! "" — Vickie Raggard Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in two sizes and a multipack option). I love using these Disney-themed snack bags as a way to pack a few of my fave snacks, just in case I get a little hungry while stuck in a ridiculously long line. Now that Epic Universe is open, and I was stuck in a 3-hour queue, I was super thankful I filled these up with some chips that I could munch on while making friends with my fellow theme park enthusiasts. Promising review : ""Super easy to wash and dry. Used these for when we went to Disney and loved the durability and the cute characters they have on them."" — Shantelle Get it from Amazon for $9.30+ (available in 27 patterns). Plus, it's lead-, latex-, and BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and can be used for hot or cold drinks. This is an awesome bottle to have with you in theme parks! It collapses into a small size that I can just toss into my bag easily when not in use, so it's not consistently taking up space when not full of water. A refillable water bottle is key at the parks; you need to stay hydrated while trapezing under the sun. Promising review: ""Bought this water bottle for a trip to Disney World. At home, I always have my 40-ounce water bottle nearby. I was worried about walking around the park and not having quick access to water on those hot park days. We only brought a fanny pack in and didn't have room for something big. This was perfect! It wasn't too overbearing to hold and was super easy to fold up and throw in the bag when not in use. My only regret is I didn't buy two!"" — E. Alarcón Get it from Amazon for $8.29+ (available in three sizes/styles and 14 colors). Bugs. Are. Awful. And while both theme parks do a lot to make sure there are as few problems with bugs as possible, it's not perfect, so you're bound to run into a few creepy crawlies. These bracelets are *chef's kiss*. I wear one of these around my wrist while walking around the parks just to ensure my fun time won't get ruined by an ill-timed mosquito bite. Promising review : ""Great for long days outside and not having to worry about reapplying. No one got bitten for an entire week at Disney, being outside because we all had one on . Great idea to put on your ankle if you don't like the smell or want it on your wrist."" — Perpetual Purchasers Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in larger multipacks). Note: Based on the AAD Guidelines all sunscreens should have an SPF of at least 30 and protect against UVA and UVB rays. This is my daily sunscreen. I lather this on right before my normal makeup routine and carry it around in my designated theme park bag when I go to the parks because it's always a smart idea to reapply after a few hours to protect your skin from the sun. Promising review : ""I am pale and don't tan. I just burn and peel and am pale again. Other sunscreens I tried, I kept having to reapply every few hours, even though they were SPF 70 and 80, and I hated how they smelled, and they made my skin feel like it was suffocating. This sunscreen is nothing like that. The smell isn't strong, it goes on much lighter, so my skin isn't suffocating, and I only have to apply it once a day to go to Disney. Love it !"" — B_Z Get it from Amazon for $8.88 . After giving birth, my feet swell up just by the thought of walking around too much. I wear these first thing in the morning, and spend my day trapezing around Disney and Universal in comfort, knowing that I won't have to deal with the annoyance of swelling after I get home and slip off my sneakers. Read more about how compression socks may help with foot pain by helping reduce inflammation and improving circulation, according to Cleveland Clinic Promising review: ""These socks are great. I wore them for a recent trip to Disney World . At first, I was a bit concerned that the socks would feel hot (the air temperature was about 90 degrees). However, these socks are very breathable and comfortable. So, heat was not a problem. I walked all day into the evening (my fitness tracker said I walked 8 miles). Even after all that time and distance, my legs felt great! I would definitely buy more socks from this seller again."" — Florida Girl Promising review : ""These are great. I have swelling problems and used these at Disney. A week at Disney usually makes my feet and legs swell. They worked really well and were soooo helpful to have! My legs and feet didn't swell and, in turn, weren't painful . I will definitely use them for any major walking going forward."" — Kimberly C Get it from Amazon for $14.11+ (available in 17 colors and six sizes). So here's a secret — even while wearing a hijab, my hair can still get frizzy — thanks Florida humidity 🙄. I just spritz this into my hair before I brave the humidity, and this basically takes care of any potential frizz! Promising review : ""Helped control my wavy, frizzy hair even at Disney World!"" — Bridget M Promising review : ""I bought the travel size to try it out and see if it was a product I could use. I was blown away by the results. My hair is thick, dry, and has the tendency to get frizzy. In the first use after reading the instructions, I noticed a significant change! The longer I use it, the more positives I see. I do not need to restyle as heavily from day to day . The humidity has no effect. My hair looks richer in color and healthier. "" — Shauna Promising review : ""I have thick curly hair that tends to get frizzy. This has replaced all of the products I was using before: leave-in conditioner, frizz serum, curl cream, shine spray, hair spray, and various curl refreshers I have tried on the day after I wash my hair. I now only use this after washing and towel drying, then just spritz on water the second day after washing. This product makes my hair frizz-free, soft, shiny, and defines my curls! "" — Amanda C Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in two sizes). A curly hair version is also available. We can all agree that sunburns are awful, right? I keep a tube of this around all year long, and I usually reach for it after a particularly long day at the parks. It's wonderful for calming down any redness or pain from sunburns (which, to be honest, I'm ridiculously pale, so I tend to get them more often than I'd like to admit). You're gonna want to bring this on vacation because, believe me, you don't want to deal with going to the parks without it after getting sunburned on your very first park day. Promising review: ""I’ve had this bottle for over a year! It’s lasted with my family through Disney World , Destin spring break, and every time we go to the pool! I’ve had some bad sunburns. I slather this on and reapply after it’s soaked in, and I wake up with a deep tan. Whatever is in it is like magic! "" — Natalie Smith Get it from Amazon for $9.03+ (available in a three-pack). This charger uses USB C Promising review : ""Whenever we start packing for a trip, all the portable chargers are mysteriously missing. I got these right before our trip to Disney and they were perfect! Small, compact, cordless, and fast!!"" — westfield-shopper Get it from Amazon for $12.99. If you need to keep some vitamins and meds on hand, you're not gonna wanna lug around full bottles all over the parks. I keep this organizer with me (full of Tylenol usually) so that I don't need to carry around the large, clunky bottle. Promising review : ""Loved using these! It came with labels, and I was able to take meds to Disney World in my backpack. It is small enough, but also fits 10–20 tablets of most medications. It has been almost one year, and I still use them in my backpack/purse."" — Krista Bartock Get a pack of three from Amazon for $6.97 (available in two color options). This is an impressively built umbrella, and it's perfect for me and my family. It protects us from rain and shine alike, and I just keep it tucked into one of my bags' outer pockets in the event I need it (which, let's be honest, is often). Promising review : ""This is the best travel umbrella I’ve ever owned! It’s very easy to open and close one-handed with the push button. It’s very sturdy and fits nicely in a carry-on or backpack."" — C.J. Get it from Amazon for $19.91+ (available in three sizes and 22 colors). They're incredibly easy to use and refill, with zero leakage! Just press the bottom of the tube against your favorite perfume gauge and keep clicking until it is refilled. No need to carefully pour and waste your favorite perfume on the bathroom tile; just click it, and you're good to go! I have these because after a full day of sweating through the parks, believe me, you're gonna want something to freshen you up. Promising review: ""Soooo easy to use! Fit every single one of my various perfumes, from expensive to inexpensive! They’re small enough to fit right into an already-packed makeup bag or purse pocket. I have a varying schedule and feel my perfume is the topper to a pulled-together look — so knowing I can rotate through all my scents easily each day is a nice little perk!"" — Denys Davis Get four from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in three color packs and a pack of five). So life with, as of writing this, an eight-month-old, is a life of cleaning stains. I keep this small spray with me because when my daughter spits up her veggie puree or has a blowout, I don't have to panic about her ruining her outfit. I just spray the stain, run it under water, and watch it disappear. I also use it on my clothes, because I've accidentally spilled butterbeer on my Slytherin hoodie a few too many times. Promising review : "" This stuff is magic! It gets the grease out of my husband’s work clothes and gets all the food stains out of my 10-month-old daughter's clothes! It’s so easy to spray on and throw in the wash! Love the smaller sizes too, so I can keep it in the diaper bag and use while we’re away."" — Clayton Koch Get it from Amazon for $7.97 . Disney World still gives out physical park cards — cards you're gonna need to keep on hand when park hopping. My family and I wear these lanyards around our necks so that we can keep each of our individual cards on hand, and so we can make sure we can differentiate between our passes. Promising review : ""My kids used these for their pins at Disney! The zipper pouch was perfect for keeping pins not to trade safe! They opened and closed them a million times, and they held up and were very durable! The kids loved the Mickey/Minnie design. Great product! Highly recommend!"" — Amie Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . I use these water shoes every time I go to one of the water parks. Flip-flops get so irritating to use, and having to slip them off and secure them before wading into the water is annoying at best. Meanwhile, these water shoes stay secure on my feet, and when walking around, I'm not liable to slip on the floor! Promising review : ""Purchased these for my granddaughter's birthday trip to Disney World for the poolside and beach. We both like them. No slips at the poolside."" — Terri Jordan Get them from Amazon for $7.96+ (available in 46 colors, kid sizes 1–32, women's sizes 3.5–15, and men's sizes 3–14). I adore these little holders. There's such high traffic in Disney and Universal both, believe me, you're gonna want to keep some hand sanitizer on hand and hooked onto your bag so you can sanitize your hands before indulging in some pretzels or churros. These hand sanitizer holders are designed to hold a 1-oz. bottle of Pocket Bac hand sanitizer from Bath and Body Works. Daisy Dimple Designs is a small business on Etsy based in Kenosha, Wisconsin. They sell a wide variety of Disney-inspired products and bags. Promising review : ""Loved them! Great service and wonderful product."" — Lori Torres Get it from Daisy Dimple Designs on Etsy for $9.50 (available in 10 patterns). And when this deliciously smelling scent has finished, you can replace the case with any other Touchland set! Check out what Buzzfeed editor Heather Braga has to say about this : ""I am a self-proclaimed Disney Adult, so you better believe I was excited to literally get my hands on this Touchland collab! I love that I can reuse it with other Touchland sprays when this one runs out (they're so moisturizing) and that I can choose to attach it to my keys or toss it in my tote. The included power mist is watermelon scented (divine) and would be refreshing to use on a hot summer day."" Promising review : ""I absolutely love these hand sanitizers! We brought them with us to Disney World and managed not to get sick, which is hard to do with so many people around you. Every sanitizer I’ve used has dried out my sensitive skin but these made my hands even softer!! My kids had fun with the spray function so I didn’t even have to make them use it, they would ask for it! I really don’t do many reviews but I loved this product enough to share with others :)"" — Carrie Get it from Amazon for $20 .

Popilush is a small business Promising review : ""I absolutely love this Popilush shapewear jumpsuit! It’s the perfect combination of style and functionality. The built-in bra is supportive and eliminates the need for extra layers, which is great for summer. The square neckline adds a chic touch, making it easy to dress up or down depending on the occasion. The material is soft, breathable, and has just the right amount of stretch, hugging all the right places without feeling too tight. It smooths out my figure beautifully and boosts my confidence every time I wear it . Plus, the shorts stay in place, which is a huge bonus. It works as both a standalone outfit or a base layer under dresses and oversized shirts. I’ve worn it for casual outings and even dressed it up with accessories for a night out—it’s so versatile! If you’re looking for a comfortable shapewear jumpsuit that doubles as a stylish outfit, this is a must-have. Highly recommend!"" — Karen Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in sizes S–XXL and in eight colors). Promising reviews : ""Have this skort in a few different colors. Love it! Thin, comfortable, and true to size. The shorts underneath have pockets which is great. They have so many colors to chose from will definitely be ordering more."" — Sam ""This skirt is incredibly comfortable! The fabric is lightweight and breathable, making it perfect for any physical activity. The built-in shorts provide extra coverage and support, ensuring I can move freely without any worries. The built-in shorts are a game-changer. They stay in place and prevent any chafing, which is a huge plus during intense workouts. The addition of pockets is fantastic — they are spacious enough to hold essentials like my phone, keys, or even a small wallet. It’s so convenient not having to carry a bag! This skirt is perfect for a wide range of activities. I’ve worn it for running, yoga, tennis, and even just running errands. It transitions seamlessly from workout wear to casual wear, making it a versatile addition to my wardrobe."" — Jackie Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in sizes XS–XXL and in 32 colors/prints). BuzzFeed shopping editor Elizabeth Lilly (pictured above on the right!) has this set and says: "" I've worn it many times both while traveling and at home in NYC, including to a sweltering Yankees baseball game, a long (also sweltering) weekend in Lisbon, as a coverup on a Caribbean cruise, and just recently to Boquete, Panama!"" Promising review : ""I got so many compliments when wearing this set on vacation in Hawaii! The top is very comfortable and cropped at just the right length. The shorts were a little see-through, but for the price, they were very comfortable."" — Courtney Smith Get it from Amazon for $31.34+ (available in sizes XS–XL and in 13 colors/patterns). Promising review : ""I loved these pants — I got the red print with the pink floral pattern. I got so many compliments, and they were so comfortable! I wore them during a long day of traveling and navigating airports, and they held up beautifully."" — Amazon Customer Get them from Amazon for $24.59+ (available in sizes S–XXL and in 28 colors/prints). Promising review : ""Bought it for travel so I could have a cute comfy outfit. I love the thumb holes, it’s a great length and the way it hangs was perfect too. Not too cropped. Inside is the softest fleece and I like how long the zipper is. If you don’t wear a shirt under it, the zipper stays perfectly in place and is very durable. Also loved the thickness because I was warm without being too hot."" — Jessica J. Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in sizes XXS–XXL and in 32 colors). You know that TikTok sound ""If I like it…I'll just grab it in a different color""? These shoes are my kryptonite. I have them in four different colors and wear them with EVERYTHING, whether I'm on vacation or at home. They go with skirts and dresses just as well as with jeans, and they've never given me a blister!!! According to the health app on my iPhone, my most recent trip included 57 miles of walking, and my feet were in tip-top shape despite walking all day, every day, through four different countries. Pro tip: If you're a women's size 8 or smaller, you can get them in big kids sizes (I'm a 8 women's, so I get a 6 in kids), and they're like half the price!! Promising review : ""I've been eyeing these shoes for quite a while, and finally caved as I was due for a new casual but smart-looking tennis shoe. I love the platform and neutral color way of these, and I wear them confidently with jeans, trousers, and dresses alike. I purchased them in time for a week-long trip to London, where I wore them every single day. In fact, I didn't wear any of the other shoes I'd brought along with me, as these were so versatile and comfortable. In the end, I walked miles and miles around London and its surrounding towns/villages and was very comfortable."" — Brooke Get them from Amazon for $59.99+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in five colors). Promising reviews: ""I bought this jacket in January of 2020. I hardly ever write reviews but clearly, this jacket means enough to me to take the time years later to write its praises. It has been to hell and back with me and all my girlfriends. ALL of us wear it consistently and funny thing is we're all different sizes . I bought the large, in light blue with no fraying except for the bottom back. It's the PERFECT denim shade. One girlfriend is super petite and it's plenty oversized on her and looks great. I am petite with much broader shoulders and it fits me perfectly with an oversized look. My other girlfriend is plus size and it fits her like a regular jean jacket. It's so dang durable and the more you wash it (I've washed it over 100 times) the more relaxed the denim gets. I just love the way it looks with everything, especially when I wear it with the same color denim jeans. I freaking love this thing and I have like, 10 other jean jackets — this one FAR EXCEEDS any others. BUY IT NOW!"" — Heather ""Soft and oh so cute! Very versatile. I purchased the size large and am a size large in tops. It was perfectly oversized and didn’t feel like I was being swallowed by it or like it was too tight on my shoulders ."" — jb Get it from Amazon for $30.99+ (available in sizes S–XXL and in five colors/washes/styles). Reviewers agree that if you want it fitted, size down. Promising reviews: ""I saw this girl wearing this exact style of dress with a Skims tag on the back, and honestly, it made me so grateful that I purchased this dress instead. It looks exactly like the Skims version, and I could be biased, but the material of this dress looked better than the Skims one. If you want it to be a little snug, I would definitely recommend sizing down one size from your normal size. So freaking comfortable and made out of thick material."" — Kaitlyn "" I have the Skims dress in black and wanted to look for a cheaper version , but read reviews and some said that it is a bit looser than expected. I would agree that the small is a bit loose. If you want a snatched look definitely get a size smaller as it is very stretchy . I'm 5' tall so this is a bit long on me, even when I wear heels. In comparison to the Skims, the material is smoother while Skims has a ribbed texture. You honestly can't tell the difference. Good bang for your buck if you ask me! "" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes XXS–XL and 10 colors). Promising reviews: ""This is perfect for travel. I've worn it as PJs, on a plane with a blazer, and for a nine-hour car trip. Super comfortable and goes anywhere. I'll definitely be getting more!"" — My Cat Steve Judges My Purchases. ""I bought the navy blue to take on vacation after reading an article about how easy care these jumpsuits are. I loved it so much I bought the green. I take them out of my suitcase, hang them up, and they are ready to go in a few hours, no ironing needed. I get compliments every time I wear one of them."" — AKSunshine Get it from Amazon for $24.61+ (available in women's sizes S–3X and 32 colors/patterns). I already had these pants in driftwood, black, and martini olive — and I just picked up two more colors for an upcoming trip — because I can't get enough. They're extremely comfy, wash beautifully, and deliver a low-fuss look that's still super pulled together. I agree with the majority of reviewers who say they run large, so size down if you're between sizes! Promising review : ""I loved these linen pants so much I ordered them in two colors. My go-to summer pants; they're great high-quality linen and so comfortable. Easy to dress down at the beach or wear with a tailored top or sweater out to dinner. Already thinking of how I'll style them for fall! A must-buy. Runs slightly large, so size down!"" — Ashley C. Get them from Quince for $39.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and in 11 colors/designs). Promising review : ""I LOVE this crop top. It actually comes just below the rib cage (even with size D cup) and covers my entire boob (not spilling out the side). I still wear a bra underneath, but the top actually covers the straps so I'm not worried. It is double lined so it hides bra lines, and the material is thicker, not sheer at all, and does not bunch up. I also LOVE, I am not having to constantly pull it down, it's not constantly rolling up. I would actually buy this in more colors."" — Katbug Get it from Amazon for $14.38+ (available in sizes S–XXL and in 29 colors). Promising review: ""I highly recommend this wonderful outfit. I ordered two sets, but now that I've received them, I'm gonna have to order more colors. I can't get over how super cozy and warm they are ."" — Betibu Get it from Amazon for $49.25+ (available in sizes XS–XL and in 17 colors and  patterns). Promising review: ""This skirt is absolutely stunning! The quality is amazing for the price. I’ve bought similar skirts at other stores that are $60+ but this one is the best I’ve owned. You won’t regret it!"" — Abby Get it from Amazon for $28.99+ (available in sizes S–XL and in 24 colors). Promising review : "" This trench coat is well constructed and very high quality. It looks great over formal attire but can also elevate a casual look. It has a slightly loose fit, as expected with this style, but can be cinched with the belt. It’s lightweight, making it ideal for spring or fall. Just enough to cut the chill and keep you dry in the rain but not overly warm. This is my second LF trench; the first had a plaid flannel lining, which — while very soft and pretty — always made me sweat. This one is perfect!!"" — Ash Get it from Amazon for $76.49+ (available in three colors and sizes XS–3X). Promising review : ""Bought these for both my daughter and me, and they look great on both of us!!! They’re extremely comfortable, and they stretch just enough. The quality is exactly what you expect from Levi’s. We purchased three pairs in total and plan on purchasing more in other colors."" — Lulu herrera Get them from Amazon for $40+ (available in sizes 24–32 Standard and 35–39 Plus and in 14 washes). These boots generally fit true to size, but if you plan on wearing thicker socks or if you're between sizes, it's recommended to size up. Thesus is a mission-driven, Ontario, Canada-based small biz creating outdoor footwear that's easy on the planet, the eyes, and your feet! Their materials are 90% sustainable and traceable — and they're working toward 100%. This brand is all about the details, taking years to develop each collection, and traveling the globe to seek out the best materials for the health of both people and the planet. Promising review: ""I took these hiking in the Rockies and they held up very well. The thicker sole also helped cushion my feet from rocky terrain. They look good too!"" — Alice Get it from Thesus for $198 (available in EU sizes 36–46 and 14 colors). Promising review: ""Love this dress so much. It’s like wearing a satin nightgown but out in public. I pair a tank top over it and sneakers for a casual look. The slits are sexy without being overtly sexy, and the material just hugs my curves with enough room to still move about."" — Lewis Fam Get it from Amazon for $26.42+ (available in sizes XXS–5X and 21 colors). Promising review : ""These sandals are a game-changer. One of my friends got a pair and I thought they were the cutest shoes ever, I did a double-take when she told me they were Crocs. Really? That ugly clog-making company? Well, call me a Crocs convert because I want a pair in every color. I’ll die in these shoes because I’m never going to take them off. It feels like you’re walking on clouds; they’re so comfortable and supportive. The gradual platform looks edgy but is super easy to walk in — I can still run after my toddler all day. These elevated sandals have changed my life. They go with everything — jeans, shorts, dresses. Buy the shoes, guys."" — OS Get them from Amazon for $40.99+ (available in sizes 4–11 and in 16 colors/patterns). Promising review : ""This thing fits like a dream! I am a pretty 'chesty' person so dresses can sometimes be hit or miss. But this is perfect. I did size down, and it fit me perfectly. 10/10. I’m buying more color,s too ."" — Ashley Patterson Get it from Amazon for $12.99+ (available in sizes S–XL and in 18 colors). I know Birkenstocks are expensive, but they really do last forever (mine average three years with near CONSTANT wear), and once they're broken in, they're so dang comfortable. I've worn them everywhere — including up and down the hills of Positano, at the beach in Jamaica, through old towns in Montenegro, etc. etc. — and they haven't done me wrong. Living in NYC, they're also what I wear 90% of the time come spring and summer, so they've got miles and miles on them. Get them from Birkenstock for $115 (available in women's 4/4.5–12/12.5 standard and wide). Check it out on TikTok! Promising reviews: ""This top is an absolute wardrobe must-have! The fit is versatile and it's super comfortable. I recommend going up a size — it’s perfect for layering or styling on its own. Whether you’re pairing it with jeans for a casual vibe or dressing it up, this top has you covered for any occasion!"" — Alejandra ""If you are wondering if you should purchase this, just do it. It’s my go-to for nights out with the girls or date night. Just pair with some cute jeans and booties and you are good to go."" — Maia Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in sizes XS–XL and in 17 colors). Macarena Collection is a Buena Park, California–based small biz with all sorts of Mexican-made leather sandals, embroidered Huipil shirts, and home goods. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly has a very similar pair from the same small biz, and here's what she has to say: ""I swear, these are the comfiest shoes I've ever worn straight out of the box. On my first day of wearing them, I walked about 40 city blocks with no pain, blistering, or rubbing. Zilch ! I basically live in them now, and it turns out they match basically everything I wear. I most recently wore them on a day trip to Malacca, Malaysia. I walked all over Jonker Street in search of rice balls and baba cendol and up a grueling hill to see the ruins of St. Paul's Church. Despite it feeling about 1000% humidity, these sandals kept my feet cool and comfy for hours and hours...like they always do!"" Promising review : ""I am loving these shoes! They are high quality, super comfortable, and go with anything. I bought them in both black and brown and have been wearing them daily!!!! I would recommend them to anyone. I read the reviews before I bought them and bought a half-size smaller than I normally wear. They fit perfectly."" — Sarah Niegocki Get them from Macarena Collection on Etsy for $48.74 (originally $64.99; available in sizes 5–10). Promising reviews : ""From the buttery smooth feel to the color and the fashionable fit, I love this top! It’s a great alternative to a casual tank top to dress up any look!"" — Robin Cowan ""Adorable top! Material isn’t see through at all — that’s what I was worried about. So soft and comfortable. Wore it almost everyday on my cruise!!"" — Abby Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (originally $23.99; available in sizes XS–XL and in 19 colors). I bought these in cream and black first and loved them so much that I picked up another pack with white and brown. They're surprisingly thick, do not wrinkle, are bra-friendly, affordable, and look much more expensive than they are. Promising review : ""True to size tops that can be dressed up or more casual. Sculpts the body and thick quality fabric that washes well and looks expensive . The asymmetrical design is great. Love!"" — Nirvana Get a pack of two from Amazon for $27.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and in 18 color combinations). Laboo Leather is a family-owned small biz based in Budapest, Hungary, making handmade leather sandals and wallets. Promising reviews: ""I adore my sandals!

They've been holding up to a lot of summer adventures and still look new."" — barunnergirl Get them from Laboo Leather on Etsy for $113.14+ (available in sizes 4.5–15.5 and 10 colors — you can also request a custom size for an additional cost).

Shakalo is a San Diego–based small business that started to figure out a way to help people, especially parents remove sand before leaving the beach. The soft fabric pouch allows the powder to remove the sand without scattering everywhere. Promising review: ""We recently moved to a beach area, and we are constantly there. This item has changed our entire lives! It lasts decently long (depending on how much you use it), it smells super good (not at all like baby powder), and it's super effective. It has saved me from vacuuming my car at least 1x–2x a week. I even use it on my dogs' paws and bellies to make sure they're taken care of. I will definitely be buying the refill and another bag to have exclusively in the car."" — Gabbs Uresti Get it from Amazon for $24.99 (available in two sizes). Promising review: ""Absolutely love this! I have filled it up with everything but the kitchen sink and it just glides over the sand. Everyone watches and people ask where I purchased it. Definitely recommend if you take more than you can carry to the beach."" — Danita Get it from Amazon for $269.99+ (available in two colors and with two or four balloon wheels). Promising review: ""Bags held up great at the beach and the scoopers are very sturdy. My girls loved the cute bags to keep their shells in."" — Kayla Get a set of two from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in four styles). Promising review: ""The adults in this house love water balloons but not the mess…plus with toddlers around, it didn’t quite make sense to have water balloons but we saw a random video on TikTok and HAD to find reusable water balloons to try out. These were the first ones we bought to try out, and WHOA we were blown away! Super easy too for the 2- and 3-year-old to use, which means more fun for all of us!! Do not think twice or continue with regular water balloons, you’ll waste precious time cleaning up and filling that could be used to make memories. "" — Taurus Get a four-pack from Amazon for $14.99+ (also available in packs of 6, 12, and 16). Promising review: ""Good quality magnets, Easy to refill! Several rounds and still none have broken!

Definitely worth the price!"" — Taylor Schofield Get it from Amazon for $27.99 (available in 11 styles). Promising review: ""Easy to travel with, and clean off. Folds up easily and is very durable, with no holes or anything yet. Great value for the money, perfect for vacation."" — Jillian Get a set of three for $19.99 (available in four styles). Note: Because the watermelon ball is full of water, it's heavier than other types of balls, so multiple reviewers warn against throwing it at people's heads! Promising review : ""May have been the best vacation toy we purchased for our beach trip. We played with it daily in the pool. Everyone, from the kids to the adults, enjoyed tossing it around and watching it rise to the surface. The kids also loved swimming around with it for a little added buoyancy. Well worth the money. We will be adding to our collection with the larger size before our next trip!"" — bridgetb Get it from Amazon for $17.54 (available in two sizes, two colors, and a glow-in-the-dark version). I use this on my kids all the time! In a pinch, I've used it on myself as well. It rubs in easily (thankfully because putting sunscreen on kids is a TASK and a half) and smells nicely of coconut. I also use Sun Bum's Sunscreen Stick on my son's face, which is equally fantastic, because it's easier to apply in a pinch than a cream. Note: Based on the AAD Guidelines all sunscreens should have an SPF of at least 30 and protect against UVA and UVB rays. Additionally, sunscreen is only made for children over the age of 6 months . Promising review: ""This is the only mineral sunscreen I will use or put on my children. It's the only brand I've tried that goes on smooth and not super thick , and doesn't leave a white residue. Works great and no harmful ingredients, what's not to love!"" — Natalie Anderson Get it from Amazon for $16.49. Check out how easy it is to apply sunscreen with this clever gadget in this TikTok. Solar Buddies is a small business based in the UK, founded by two moms, who set out to develop a product that would make applying sunscreen on kiddos easier. As a parent myself, I can confirm this gadget is fantastic. During the summer I'd keep one in my diaper bag to ensure my son was protected from the sun at any given moment. He loved being ""painted"" and I loved knowing applying sunscreen wasn't going to be a fight. Promising review: "" I hesitated, but I originally saw this item on TikTok and knew it would make life SO MUCH easier when it comes to putting sunscreen on myself and my kids, and I have to say, I am NOT disappointed!! The sunscreen goes on so smoothly and evenly, and I feel like I will be saving so much sunscreen now that I'm not just squirting a huge glob in my hands and spending so much time trying to rub in a ridiculous amount into mine and my children's skin. My only regret with buying these is that I wish I would have bought a couple more so that I could have different ones for each of the sunscreens we use! But I will be recommending these to everyone!"" — Carmen Get a pack of two from Amazon for $27.98+ (available in four colors and in three-packs). I adore this sunscreen! I'm very fair skinned and prone to getting sunburnt, so I have to stay very on top of applying SPF at all times. This one isn't greasy at all, blends in immediately, and LITERALLY adds shimmery sparkles wherever its applied. I truly don't even mind putting it on — it's a welcome addition to my skincare routine. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this sunscreen. I’m always wary of 'for everyone' tinted products because they aren’t usually made with us in mind. But this one hits the mark. It looks amazing on my brown skin. Non-streaky, no white cast. It gives my skin a subtle shimmer. The video and pics are in direct sunlight so you can see it in full effect. For reference, I have combination, thirty-something-year-old skin. Glowscreen is officially in my skincare rotation."" — Lovely91 Get it from Amazon for $38 . Promising review: ""Looked great, held the beach towels on the chairs well on the beach, lasted and can be used on the next trip. Was easy to use and open."" — Victoria Get them from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in five styles). This item is noted for children under the age of 3 — and please never leave your baby unattended in it since there *is* a shallow body of water present. Promising review: ""Found this after our first experience with our 9-month-old at the beach. He wanted to crawl straight in the beach so I wanted to find something that would keep him busy but yet be able to play with sand and water! This was perfect!!!! He loved it and it kept him occupied all day, on and off. We didn’t use the shade since we had a canopy up already for shade so not sure how strong the shade part of it is."" — Brittany Get it from Amazon for $25.23 . Reviewers have also attached it to their little one's cribs and car seats for extra airflow. I personally used this in my stroller during my son's first summer (he was about three months old at the time) and still use it to this day! Promising review: ""As summers get hot I knew I needed a fan for my newborn. This was perfect for his crib side, stroller, and car. It's quiet, and I love the three settings. I don't use the light but it's nice to have. I can leave it on all night on low on a hot night so my son has some air movement in his crib and a breeze on our walks when his stroller gets stuffy . I fully charged it before I used it, so the battery life isn't bad, but it will only last maybe two hours on the highest setting before dying. Battery life is short but not bad if you use it on the low setting. I charge it every few days, and it's held up nicely. Not too bad for the price."" — Queen Sweetnez Get it from Amazon for $21.32 (available in four colors). Promising review: ""We purchased the foldable sunglasses for our 7-year-old grandson, and they’ve exceeded our expectations. The foldability is incredibly convenient, making them easy to store in a small bag or even his pocket. The sunglasses are very well made, with a sturdy frame that has stood up to quite a bit of rough handling. They’re also very comfortable, and my grandson loves wearing them. The vibrant colors are a big hit, and he enjoys wearing them each day. Overall, the sunglasses are a fantastic purchase, combining convenience, durability, and style in one package."" — Victor X. Get them from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in sets of two and a variety of colors). Promising review: ""The real deal. I bought the 2/$20 and couldn't be happier! Seemingly good quality for the money, with much better light protection, is polarized, and has a nice shape and fit. MUCH better than any name-brand glasses I've ever purchased — and I buy a LOT. I spend a lot too. Not anymore. I plan on buying more of them soon just because I love sunglasses. These are my new favorites! And, they don't have the nose piece that gets caught in your hair when you wear them on your head."" — Lyndsay Marie Get them from Amazon for $10.39+ (available in 31 styles). Reviewers say this spray will leave wavy or curly hair (from 2a–4c hair) shiny, soft, and bouncy. SoCozy is a small business! Promising review: "" You need this! My 2-year-old daughter has curly, frizzy hair. And I have tried sooo many leave-in conditioners to tame her hair. Nothing thus far has worked. But this stuff is amazing! Truly defines her curls without any hold or crunch. Soft, bouncy curls. The smell is quite strong, but it does smell good. If you are sensitive to smells, you might want to prepare yourself ahead of time for this. I will buy this again and again. So glad I found something that works for my toddler's curls."" — mike Get it from Amazon for $9.29 . I bought a pack of these for my son's first summer (when he was only a few months old), during which he really only went in a pool twice. Cut to a few months later, when we signed him up for swim classes, the diapers still fit! The smallest size fits babies from 16 pounds–26 pounds (huge range) so one pack will definitely last a while. I also really enjoy the cute Finding Nemo patterns on them — who wouldn't? A fun fact I didn't know about swim diapers is that they are only really designed to hold in poop — so don't plan to keep your kiddo in them all day long an expect not to get peed on. Lesson learned. Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $9.49+ (available in sizes 3–6). Check out a TikTok of the cap in action. JellyCap is a small business that creates BPA-free caps that'll transform every cup into a sippy cup. Promising reviews: "" Hands down one of my best Amazon purchases for my girl! I love finding hidden gems like this to make parenting a little easier lol. We go camping a lot, and these are lifesavers and save me so much time washing and re-washing sippy cups! Plus, my daughter can now be trusted with her beloved Danimal yogurt! A win for mom and a win for my very satisfied and not yogurt-covered 1.5-year-old! Great idea!!"" — Ab223 Get a three-pack from Amazon for $14.99 (available in two color options). In addition to being dishwasher-, freezer-, and boil-safe, these tops are BPA-, PVC-, lead-, and phthalate-free. Promising review: ""My now 2-year-old has never, ever eaten more than a few sips out of these pouches, of any kind. I got this spill-proof lid to put on it.... she's on her second one in a matter of a minute. I think the problem was she didn't like getting messy or having me constantly pull it away. This gave her so much more control and It prevents them from being squeezed all over. Wish I discovered it a year and a half ago!"" — Amazonian Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.98+ (available in five color options). My cousin gifted me one of these for my birthday since she knows what a die-hard iced coffee drinker I am and I am obsessed . I keep it in my tote at all time for impromptu coffee runs. I love that my drinks no long drip all over tables and into my car's cup holder! Java Sok is a small business that sells an array of reusable neoprene cup holders designed to keep drinks colder and eliminate condensation. Promising review: ""Obsessed! Great stocking stuffers or a gift to yourself! Will be buying more. I’m someone who takes a while to drink their drinks (mom life) so it keeps my drinks from watering down! Love this product! Feels like a coooozy."" — Thumbs up Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in a variety of prints and five sizes). I recently tried one of these bottles for the first time and I am SOLD. I adore my Stanley cup , but it's not the *best* option for the gym (unless you're planning to do some bicep curls with it). The locking lid really does work! I can twist it, toss it into a tote bag, and move on with my life, knowing it won't spill. I fill it with ice before bed, and when I head out to the gym in the morning, it's still cold! This bottle is also BuzzFeed editor Maitland Quitmeyer' s go-to, ""It claims to keep ice for over 24 hours! The tapered base is also cupholder friendly, and the whole darn thing is dishwasher safe, too! Let me tell you, this is my new favorite water bottle. I can lock the lid with a quick twist, and throw it sideways in any tote and not even think *twice* about it leaking at all!"" Promising review: ""I am so obsessed with this thing. I get an arm workout from how heavy it is. I drink way more water when I use it, and the leakproof straw is the real deal. I left it in a hot car for six hours, and the water was still cold. I bought them for my whole family; they are the only water bottles we use now."" — Pen Name Get it from Amazon for $38+ (available in 18 colors). Promising review: ""These playing cards are a HIT. I take them out with me for social events and when visiting people, even to the beach. We just play and play. So you can get them wet and they won't soggy up and tear it just become a little hard to shuffle. It is so cool that they look like you can see right straight through them but you can't."" — Tabs Get them from Amazon for $6.97 . You deal all the cards out to your two to four players, and everyone keeps their mini-deck facedown. Everyone takes a turn putting a card down in the middle of the table, saying one of the words ""taco,"" ""cat,"" ""goat,"" ""cheese,"" and ""pizza,"" in that order. If the picture on your card matches the word that's said, everyone slaps their hand on the card in a pile as quickly as possible. The last person on the pile has to take the stack and add 'em to their cards, and whoever runs out of cards first wins! Promising review: ""We love Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza original game , so I am so happy that now I can bring this with us to the beach! My kids have already put these in our pool and have been ""diving"" for them. It's not exactly how you play the game at all, but they think it is fun! Also, the little outfits for the characters are adorable. I was skeptical about the travel clip at first, but the circle shape makes it much easier to get the cards on/off."" — Timothy M. Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . My friends are OBSESSED with Spikeball. While I'm not super coordinated and prefer to be a cheerleader (I'm accident-prone, OK!), this game is one of the most fun beach activities I've seen in a minute. It has been described as "" if volleyball and foursquare had a baby "" and can be played in a variety of ways. Also, Spikeball is a small business! Promising review: ""This is a great beach game. Its simplicity as a spin on volleyball will have you and your friends be the envy of the beach . On many occasions I was asked where I bought this game. Great fun, and a great product. Assembly was simple enough. It's just plastic clips and then finding a way to get the net tight enough onto the hoop. You might think it isn't springy enough but it will be. Remember... This isn't a trampoline!"" — Btschultz Get it from Amazon for $69.99 . Promising review: ""Got this blanket for the lake and it is great, sand comes right off. You can still fold it to fit in the bag that is attached so I do not lose the bag. Very durable, as I have had it for a couple of years, and the color has not faded. Functionally, I use it at the lake, beach, and just on the grass for a picnic."" — William Williams Get it from Amazon for $34.95 (available in two colors). Promising review : ""I LOVE this umbrella. I have used it at the beach, park, and at a random volunteer event where I fastened it to the fence! It's sturdy and easy to use. Great product!"" — MummaBags Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in two sizes and 12 colors). Promising review: ""This is an amazing speaker for traveling or going to the beach. It's portable, and you can hang it so it doesn't get dirty with sand or dust around you. It is very useful in hiking because it is light, which makes it easy to carry as you can see in the picture. The battery life is really good. I've used it three times and still doesn't need to charge, so it's about 10 hours of music. I really liked the sound quality and my friends say that they liked it, too."" — Tifanny Angulo Get it from Amazon for $39.95 (available in 16 colors). Promising review: ""This towel gets very cool and stays very cool. Instant relief. I love that it does not drip on your clothing when you are wearing it. It would be perfect if you are a spectator at a concert or sporting event, visiting a theme park (think standing in long lines), at the beach, or in a stroller for a baby to sit on if it's super hot out. I've also worn it getting back into a hot car, and it makes the ride bearable while the air conditioning kicks in. I can even see using this on someone that has a fever because it stays cool much longer than a washcloth or other fabric cooling towels."" — Michelle Candocia Get it from Amazon for $8.97 (available in two colors). Promising review: ""This product is a must-have! I absolutely love it. It holds so much food/drinks and keeps everything cold with a few ice packs. I love that it’s collapsible for easy storage. My husband loves it too. It’s perfect for the ball field, a lake day, park picnic, or a day on the farm chasing cattle. One of my favorite Amazon purchases!"" — Baylee Akins Get it from Amazon for $58.99 (available in eight colors and patterns). You can also use this in your room to keep valuables protected. Safego is a small business! Promising review: ""I bought this to take on a vacation to the Virgin Islands because my husband is super paranoid about leaving valuables unattended on the beach. At first, he scoffed that this little plastic thing wasn’t going to stop a thief, and I had wasted my money. Then he admitted that the plastic was pretty sturdy, and it was cool that we could secure the cable to our beach chairs, a fence, or a tree (most petty thieves don’t carry around cable cutters). Next thing I know, he’s storing his wallet, phone, and room keys in it along with mine. He laced the cable through other things he didn’t want stolen, like the bags containing our snorkel gear. Neighboring beachgoers asked about it and where they could get one, and he was quick to demonstrate its features. And when we got home, I overheard him showing it to his friends, with as much approval as he could muster. Hate to say I told you so...OK, no I don’t."" — Patsy Get it from Amazon for $44.95 (available in five colors). It doesn't contain any parabens, phthalates, petrolatum, or SLS. Promising review: ""I bought this before I went on a cruise. We stayed in a hotel for a few days prior and I got a little toasty by the sun. Used this and it helped drown down the burn feeling and helped heal my skin within days. By the cruise I was fine with no pains from the burn. Continued to use it daily while on vacation. Works like charm. Love it! Smells great too! Its not a loud smell or anything. Would totally recommend and buy again!"" — Victoria Ramsey Get it from Amazon for $9.99 .

BuzzFeed Staff Promising review : ""It worked great for long road trips to help with fatigue and lower back pain. I never imagined this would work as well as it did, and as an added bonus, it worked as a great pillow when we needed to pull over for short sleep [breaks] . It's worth the price for the pain it relieved."" — Jess Get it from Amazon for $23.99 (available in three colors). Promising review : ""These were a last-minute purchase before a summer road trip with our 4- and 7-year-old sons, and I couldn’t be happier! It’s a great way to keep the car organized with games, toys, colors, devices, water bottles, etc. Definitely recommend for everyday and road trip use !"" — Kathy Get a two-pack from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review : ""I used it for a 13-hour road trip to Colorado for camping/wheeling, and it held up great. So nice to be able to throw snacks, fries, or whatever on there. Perfect arm's length for everything I needed for the long drives. When I got home, I just removed the table part and used the big drink holder. Perfect to have a large water bottle in one and a big coffee tumbler in the other."" — SamoanJoe Get it from Amazon for $33.99+ (available with different add-ons). Saucemoto is a small business that was featured on Shark Tank ! Promising review : ""I bought these to try on a road trip. We have a few multi-state trips every year. I figured it couldn’t be worse than trying to juggle everything in our laps. Well, this was better than I even expected! I need to order another set so everyone has their own Saucemoto!

Promising review : ""My second-grader used this while we road-tripped for two weeks. It eliminated that awkward contortion that kids do when they nap in the car . It was definitely one of our more useful purchases for the trip. Keep in mind that the pillow is large and can take up some space in a cramped car. Outside of traveling, my kid likes to use it inside the house since it's so soft. She naps with it on the bed or just snuggles with it while reading."" — Sarah Aquino Get it from Amazon for $37.99+ (available in two styles and 10 colors). Promising review : ""These are the perfect size. We are going on a road trip, so I got one for each of my front seats. They're not too bulky, and they hold a fair amount of trash.

Read more about aromatherapy and stress and tension at Johns Hopkins . Promising review : ""I will start this by saying, I am not one to try herbal remedies of any kind. However, this had good reviews, and my husband is always looking for eucalyptus-smelling scents. The first time I tried this, both my husband and I tested it in a car ride, both fully expecting it not to work. We put it on our foreheads as directed and went about the car ride. Then, 5–10 minutes later, I realized my (very bad) headache was much better . Out of nowhere, I said, 'So does your head feel...' and my husband blurted, 'Better?? Yes!!' We were both shocked. I ended up giving mine to my mom for a trip she was taking, and bought another one. I've since used it a few more times, and it does not get rid of a headache but definitely lightens the pressure."" — Stacy S. Get it from Amazon for $12.95 . Promising review : ""I own three of the 'popular' brand stainless tumblers, but they leak like a sieve. And they are heavy! I have many chronic autoimmune illnesses, and hydration does help me, so I always have a full cup. I was interested in Brumate because I could lock it and throw it in the seat for extra water, as I tend to empty a cup every 90 minutes. It is sleek, fits my cup holders, weighs less, and is absolutely leakproof. It is a bit top-heavy, and the straw has become detached a few times. My main issue is that despite handwashing and careful handling, it has a chip in only 2 weeks of use."" — Marissa Pro Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in 15 colors). Promising review : ""I've got nothing but great things to say about this. It fits my large water bottles. Snugly. And even the water bottles that are skinny that would fit in the main cup holder, fit fine in this too. The whole thing fits tightly in the regular cup holder, so it's not wiggling around. And I still can put something else in the second cup holder."" — BenMVP Get it from Amazon for $12.69+ (available in three colors). Promising review : ""Bought this as a part of a Secret Santa gift. Package arrived quickly and was sealed well. They are also packaged separately, each in their own bag/clear wrap. Love it. :)"" — lexi Get the set from Urban Outfitters for $14.99 . Promising review: ""We are a husband-and-wife long-distance driving team, and we use these bags when we are not close to a bathroom. They totally seal with no leaks! The thin strip inside the bag turns the urine into a gel and makes disposal much easier . The size of the bag is perfect. A true lifesaver! We highly recommend!"" — Audra Baxter Get a pack of eight from Amazon for $7.99 (also available in larger pack options). Promising review : ""Perfect for what we needed! Our toddler gets super fussy in the car on longer car rides, and this mount allows us to put his favorite movies/shows on our iPad to get him through the ride. Great value, easy to install, and holds the iPad perfectly without it falling down like other things we have tried in the past. Would highly recommend this product to anyone."" — Nick M. Get it from Amazon for $14.39+ (available in two colors). Promising review : ""My family does a lot of road-tripping. This is a game-changer.

Not sure how many vehicles can hold two, but you can definitely have one even in a sedan. Highly recommend."" — scarlet Get it from Amazon for $20.98+ (available in three sizes). Promising review: ""This product sticks to the windows well. It works well in blocking the sun out of baby’s face, it’s sturdy, and will roll up easily with the click of the side button. Great look and visibility is still there even when they are down. This was a great buy."" — Quisha D. Get it from Amazon for $15.49 . Promising review: ""This screen completely covers my entire windshield – no gaps. I put it up in about two seconds. I use it every time I park. It stores next to my seat like a small umbrella. I’m parked in full south Florida sun most of the time and this sunscreen seriously helps keep my car cooler and save my dashboard. I’ve had it over a year and it’s like new. Great buy."" — Delores Get it from Amazon for $31.99+ (available in four sizes). Promising reviews : ""I got this for a cross-country road trip to help with traffic, and I am so happy I did. I haven't taken it off. It is so big that I can easily look in the rearview mirror to look in the backseat."" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $9.91+ (available in two colors and styles). Promising review : ""It worked great. Had to endure a road trip. As a couple, we have duplicates of everything: phones, iPads, wallets, drinks, and we make it maybe 100 miles before everything is all over the dash — but not anymore. Everything has a place, it was great"" — Karen D. Get it from Amazon for $13.49 (available in five colors). Promising review : ""I was unsure about these when I purchased them for my 2018 Audi Q5, but they fit perfectly and look amazing. I live in Florida, which is like living on the surface of the sun during the summer, and I was sick of scorching my legs every time I got in the car. I love how these cover the entire bottom of the seat and wrap around the front. They are comfortable to sit on and look good on the beige leather interior. No more peeling a layer of skin off the back of my thighs when I get out of the car!! Highly recommend these covers."" — Dan M Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in seven colors). Promising review : ""We absolutely love these shoulder pad cushions in our car. The seatbelt, even at its lowest setting, would scratch my neck. I would be left with scratches on my neck as a result. My husband often pulls his shoulder strap out on long trips because he is uncomfortable. Since purchasing these, I no longer get scratches and my husband is comfortable even after eight hours in the car . Great purchase!"" — Fourth Grade Teacher Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (available in 18 colors). Promising review : ""Perfect for travel. Didn't get to test it much because my pup just HAD to be in the front seat with me the whole time. I bought the front seat cover to match, so I know the material is amazing. Pretty comfortable, canvas-type material. Easily cleaned and mostly water-resistant. Had a slight spill on the front seat cover that was wiped rather quickly, and none transferred to my actual car seat. The adjustable straps and backseat anchors are easy to install."" — Ashley C. Get it from Amazon for $30.30+ (available in five colors and an optional dog seat belt).

Love the color of it and how easy it is to put together. Love that the pillows can be removed for cleaning. Very soft and comfortable for her."" — lauren Get it from Amazon for $38.99+ (available in nine colors). Promising review : ""I was not sure what to expect when I ordered these based on how low the price was, but I gave it a shot because Govee generally has a good reputation with LED lighting. When I opened the box, I was really impressed with the build quality of all the components; nothing felt cheap, the cables are heavy-duty and well-insulated for running inside a car . Everything installed very easily, and it was my first time using the Govee app, but they connected with zero issue and responded to the app. If adding ambient lighting to a car, you can't go wrong with this kit versus the 'no name' options."" — Gary Lofgren Get them from Amazon for $16.99 . Promising review: "" Never thought I'd spend this kind of money on a simple eye mask, but I did and don't regret it at all. Yes, it's perfect for side sleepers, it doesn't move, and it blocks out every bit of light. The game changer is the space around your eyes, so it's not pushing on your lashes. Buy this, and you'll never look back."" — Jessica Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in eight styles). Promising review : ""Mattress is as described. Pump easily inflates mattress so that it fills in the backseat area of my truck. Great for trips when it's only my wife and I. Provides a flat area for putting items and a space to nap in if desired. Nice product and inexpensive."" — Bob L in Hamilton, NJ Get it from Amazon for $26.59+ (available in two colors). Promising review : ""Great camera, the brightness is great, and night mode works great. The camera is a great value for the money, especially with the clarity of the picture. It was pretty easy to install with just two wires. We ordered another one for my husband‘s truck, and it works great!"" — Mainegirl96 Get it from Amazon for $26.99 (available as a dual-camera pack as well). Promising review: ""I bought this for my cellphone. It comes with a magnet to attach to my cellphone, and then I attach the other magnet to the dash of my car air vent. After I make a call, I attach my cellphone to the magnet so I can talk hands-free. My voice is heard clearly by the recipient of my call. I love it."" — Arlene Berge Get a two-pack from Amazon for $13.99 . Check out a TikTok of the airplane headrest in action. Promising review : ""This is exactly what I needed for when I travel.

Great idea!"" — Miss Erini Get it from Amazon for $19.59 (available in eight colors). Promising review: ""I’m a flight attendant, and I travel with this pillow all the time! In hotel rooms, I use it to support my neck; on the plane, I use it to support my lumbar area. When I drive, it helps my lower back. I love that it has a liner that can be removed to wash.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/epic-universe-rides-review,travel,,"Universal's Epic Universe's Rides Have The Internet Divided, And Here's What I Thought Was Worth The Long Lines",18,2398,11,3,"My review of what's overhyped, underrated, and absolutely incredible. BuzzFeed Staff Here I am frying in the sun in front of Monsters Unchained: The Frankenstein Experiment, one of the attractions I was most EXCITED to ride. Full disclosure: While I was invited by Universal to Epic Universe, all opinions are my own. Thoughts: Tucked away in the Isle of Berk, this coaster might not have the hype of Stardust Racers or the name recognition of a Harry Potter attraction, but don't sleep on it because this ride delivers in a huge way. It also travels throughout part of the land giving you great views of the Isle of Berk, while making you feel like you're flying on a dragon. I rode it more than once, and it was just as exciting the second time around. Now, speaking of Harry Potter , this ride gets a lot of comparisons to Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, and I can see why. I'd say this is a less scary version of Hagrid's...however, I don't know if this is truly a family coaster, as it does have multiple launches, sharp turns, and some surprise bursts of speed. If you have kids and they're not used to roller coasters, I don't know if this would be a good first one to bring them on (unless they're on the older side or have ridden Hagrid's before). One con is that a lot of the queue is outdoors and not all of it is shaded, so in the heat, this could make waiting for the ride unpleasant. Bottom line: This is a must-do. Hiccup's Wing Gliders might not be the flashiest ride at Epic Universe, but it's easily one of the best. If you're a fan of Hagrid's or just want a coaster that nails the balance between thrills and fun, make this one a priority!!! Thoughts: I didn't know what to expect from Dragon Racer's Rally. I hadn't really seen anything about it on TikTok or YouTube. Now, it looks super fun from the outside, with riders spinning and flipping through the sky like they’re training to become full-on dragon racers. But once I got on, the experience kind of fizzled. The ride gives you some control over your ""dragon vehicle,"" letting you attempt barrel rolls by shifting the wings yourself. In theory, that sounds cool, but in practice, I found it awkward and harder to pull off than expected. I spent more time trying to make the ride fun than actually enjoying it. I would say that on the plus side, it seemed like the queue, while outdoors, was shaded. Bottom line: This is a skip. Unless the line is a short wait, then it could be worth giving it a shot. Honestly, with Hiccup's Wing Gliders being such a standout attraction next door, I wouldn't rush back for this one. Thoughts: Okay, so this isn't really an attraction, and more of a meet-and-greet photo opp. I also get that a photo with Toothless sounds like a must-do, especially if you've got kids who love How to Train Your Dragon (some of the most popular animated films of recent years). But trying to get a photo with Toothless ended up being one of the more disappointing parts of my visit. The line was long, like, surprisingly long , and to make things worse, there's virtually no shade while you wait. In the Florida heat, that was a brutal combo, and I can't imagine trying to do it with kids. I never ended up getting my photo because my phone was running out of battery, and I ended up getting out of line. Bottom line: Unless you're a die-hard Toothless fan, this is one experience you can probably skip. With that said, I understand that with kids, you might not have the option to ignore this one, so it would be worth doing first thing in the morning (when it's cooler) or in the evening, when most people have already done it. And prepare your kids for realistic expectations about waiting in line for this one! Thoughts: We got a lot of first looks, concept art, and previews of the animatronics for Monsters Unchained. All of this led to it being one of the most highly anticipated attractions at Epic Universe, and from a technical and visual standpoint, it really is one of the best rides at any theme park anywhere. The queue alone is jaw-dropping, with very detailed sets and effects that really set the tone. Of course, the animatronics throughout the ride are next-level impressive. Another thing, I found it refreshing to see an attraction (and land) that wasn’t tied to an existing IP. Sure, it's based on the Universal Monsters, but not based on the old movies. An original concept in a big theme park in 2025? That alone earns it points. Here is where I might get people yelling at me: Once the ride actually starts, things get a little shaky. The storyline felt oddly pieced together. Not that rides need huge storylines, but this one just didn't pay off narratively. Also, the ride system is the exact one used in Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, which immediately made me compare it to that, and IMHO, this ride isn't as good as Forbidden Journey. Bottom line: Okay, this one I think is just going to be a difference of opinion, but I would skip it. However, I know people love this ride, so you might too. If anything, it's worth checking out for the visuals and top-tier tech, and immersive world. Also, I would NOT bring little kids onto this ride because they might find this pretty scary. Thoughts: I am going to state the common complaint about this ride: Yes, it’s short, but it's also a ton of fun from start to finish and packs in a surprising amount of thrills for its size. With quick turns, smooth launches, and just the right amount of intensity, it strikes a great balance between family-friendly and genuinely thrilling (like there were a few moments where I thought my phone was going to fly out of my pocket). It also has a spinning coaster ride system, which makes it unique from most other coasters. Another pro is that this ride's queue, while outdoors, is forest-themed, so there are lots of trees to help protect you from the sun. Bottom line: Even if it's not the flashiest or longest ride at Epic Universe, Curse of the Werewolf is absolutely worth hopping on, especially if you love a smooth coaster with smaller thrills and zero filler. Thoughts: I'll admit, I wasn’t expecting to be wowed by a carousel, but Constellation Carousel ended up being a delightful surprise. From the glowing, Art Nouveau-style creatures to the starry lighting and ethereal music, the theming wonderfully matches Celestial Park. What really makes it stand out is the movement; the carousel vehicles don't just go up and down (pretty high!), they gently perform 360-degree rotations, which adds an almost floating sensation that's totally unique. Bottom line: Yes, this is just a carousel, but it's absolutely one you shouldn’t skip. It's beautifully designed and whimsical, and perfect for the entire family. One thing I would recommend is riding this at night, when all the lights and effects are more visible and the carousel takes on a dreamy look. Thoughts: Stardust Racers is hands-down one of the must-do rides at Epic Universe. As the park's signature high-speed roller coaster and one of its overall signature rides, it delivers exactly what you’d hope for: an adrenaline-packed thrill ride. The dual-track setup adds an extra layer of excitement, especially when the coasters seem to narrowly miss each other in a perfectly timed near-collision moment. That said, if you're going in expecting something as intense or wild as VelociCoaster over at Islands of Adventure, temper those expectations just a tiny, tiny little bit. Stardust Racers is thrilling and fast, but with slightly less intensity. Bottom line: Do NOT skip!!! Stardust Racers is a fast-paced coaster that absolutely earns its place as a headliner. And likely a ride you might want to ride way more than once. Also, the green side is slightly more intense than the yellow side, if that makes a difference to you! Thoughts : I've ridden this ride before at Universal Studios Hollywood, so I knew exactly what I was getting into. First off, it's definitely a cool concept, but the actual ride just doesn't land for me. The queue and theming are incredible (walking through Bowser's Castle is a legit highlight, and it's filled with a TON of Easter eggs), but once you're on the ride, it starts to fall apart a bit. The augmented reality headset is clunky and can be confusing, especially if it's your first time riding. It's hard to tell what's actually happening in the game part, and the gameplay mechanics (steering, aiming, and trying to hit targets) just feel a little awkward and overwhelming. Bottom line: If you've never been on it before, it’s absolutely worth doing once just to experience it all, especially if you're a Nintendo fan. But it's definitely not something I’d wait more than 30–40 minutes for. Thoughts: This ride is an exact clone of the one they have at Universal Studios Japan (in fact, the whole land seems to be an exact clone). I don't think I have ever done a POV watch of the attraction on YouTube, so I had no idea what to expect. I really, really, really wanted to like Yoshi's Adventure because it looks adorable, gives scenic views of the land, and adds so much kinetic energy to the land. But unfortunately, the experience just didn't do it for me. Views aside, the ride is extremely boring, with most of it out in the open sun with very little shade. Apparently, there's a light gameplay element where you're supposed to search for colored eggs, but I genuinely didn't realize that was even part of it until halfway through because I heard the people in front and behind me asking themselves if there was a game involved. Bottom line: I'd skip it. Yoshi's Adventure might be best for younger kids, who will enjoy the visuals. It's definitely not something I’d wait in line for. Thoughts: I had seen a few POV TikToks of this ride when it first opened in Japan, so I was really excited to ride this. And, it lived up to everything I expected, in fact, I walked off loving it way more than I expected. The ride does a great job mixing impressive tech, amazing animatronics, and some genuinely thrilling moments!!! Of course, there's also the ""boom coaster"" system that creates the illusion your cart is leaping across broken tracks, and it totally works. (Though I actually think it might even look better from the outside than while you're actually on it.) While some people have said the ride is too short, I actually thought the length was just right. Along with the other complaint that the ride is too shaky, as it's mimicking the sensation of being on a rickety mine track, which I also didn't mind, as I thought it added to the ride. With that said, be prepared because it is really shaky, and don't pull out your phones and try to film because I saw more than one person almost lose it due to the shaking. Bottom line: Mine-Cart Madness is a must-ride, full of great theming and thrills. This is also a great coaster for kids who are ready to ride something with a little more intensity to it. Thoughts: Going into Le Cirque Arcanus, I had no idea what to expect. In fact, I might have skipped the show had the people I was with not suggested we check it out. I'd heard mixed things, with some people saying it wasn't good. But after seeing it myself? I honestly don’t understand the criticism. I was genuinely impressed! Based on a traveling wizarding circus from the Fantastic Beasts films, the show blends live performance, optical illusions, and large-scale puppetry in a way that's visually striking and super immersive. The performers were great, and the puppets and magical creatures were especially well done. Also, the storytelling was really good, and I found myself wondering what was going to happen next. Bottom line: Le Cirque Arcanus might not be your typical theme park show, and yes, it could be a little intense for smaller kids, but for fans of darker fantasy and theatrical storytelling, it's absolutely worth checking out. Plus, its queue and theater spaces are nice and air conditioned, which makes it a perfect place to escape on a hot day. Thoughts: Immersive and detailed, like you stepped into the movie, from the moment you enter the queue, it's clear this ride is operating on another level. This is one of those rides that instantly cemented itself as a must-do, and not just for Harry Potter fans, but for anyone who loves immersive, story-driven attractions. Once you're on the ride, you find out the scale is massive, the details are rich, and the experience feels more in line with something like Pirates of the Caribbean. There is a scene where a Death Eater animatronic moves so fluidly that it took me a moment to realize he wasn't a person in a costume. Yes, the ride uses screens and a lot of them, a big complaint I've seen online. But honestly, it works 90% of the time. The screen effects are blended seamlessly with physical sets and effects, and it would've been nearly impossible to pull off the storyline demands without them. The transitions between practical and digital work well together, so that you're never really pulled out of the action. Bottom line: It goes without saying that this is a MUST-DO for me!!! My first thought upon entering the Battle at the Ministry was the line in Jurassic Park where John Hammond says, ""Spared no expense."" You can tell the amount of money and care Universal put into the attraction to make it big, bold, and flawlessly immersive! Now, there are no front-of-the-line passes available for this attraction, and waits can get into three-plus hours. So, if you go, keep that in mind as you might have to sacrifice doing other attractions to get on this one.",2025-06-24T17:49:33.795855+00:00

BuzzFeed Shopping editor Emma Lord swears by these: ""The moldable silicone of Mack's Earplugs contours easily to the shape of your ear to block out noise much more effectively than other foam or plastic varieties, and the noise reduction is so good that if I pair them with a white noise machine (or just like a white noise loop on Spotify), I genuinely don't hear noises from outside my room. Not only that but once they're in place, they stay locked there until you decide to pull them out. Granted, I can still hear my alarm, and like, if the fire alarm went off or something, I'd definitely wake right up. But noises that are distant and loud are pretty easily canceled out by these. I've also *loved* these for traveling — if you put these babies in on a plane, not only does it help reduce some of the YIKES factor when the plane takes off (it's loud!!), but it cancels out the murmuring noises of passengers on the flight and makes it easier to get some shuteye.

Promising review : ""I bought this nifty gadget about six months ago for a multileg, ultra-long-haul trip, and it more than held up the entire duration . I was able to finagle it to fit the tray tables on different planes, and like others, I find the height just nice when clamped onto a stowed tray table . It also works on my roller carry-on handle during layovers. However, I find myself using it a lot outside of travel too! Work-wise, I've clamped it onto my office desk shelving to hold my phone at eye level beside my computer . At home, I simply clamped it to a deck of cards, and it turns into a versatile stand that I can place on any flat surface. Heck, I've been using it to hold my phone comfortably at eye level while watching videos in bed. It's extremely well built, and I find myself fidgeting with it all the time. Thus far it still feels solid, and I don't anticipate breaking it any time soon.

Promising reviews: ""I’ve had this hoodie for about 3 hours total, and it’s already one of the favorite things I own. I was eyeing this for a while and during a particularly annoying meltdown, I caved. BEST DECISION EVER. I’ve had weighted blankets in the past, and they often cause my back or hips to hurt eventually, but this doesn’t. The arms are pretty heavy but definitely manageable."" — Darcy ""Everything I could ever want and more. This is the coziest thing ever, and I was able to wear it to work, and it helps ease anxiety sooooo much!! I cannot recommend this jacket enough."" — meredith Get it from Thera for $158 (available in sizes XS–3XL and six colors; also available in minky fabrics and children's sizes). The kit makes three drinks. Promising review: ""A neat kit to have on hand, take to a hotel, or give as a gift. All of the tools and ingredients you need to make the drink are in the kit (except the alcohol and ice). I found the kit to be cheaper than purchasing the individual ingredients for an old fashioned. I would definitely buy this again."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in eight flavors). Reviewers say it's ideal for a suitcase that can roll on four wheels so you don't tip over your drink. It'll still work for a suitcase that has to tilt while it rolls; just be careful if the drinks are open at the top. Promising review : ""This cup holder is perfect! It helps me a lot! Last time I took a plane with a suitcase and a cup of coffee, I dropped and spilled my drink everywhere when it was my turn to check my passport and ticket. It was a nightmare! This time, I bought this cup holder to do me a favor! I don't have to worry about where my cup and phone are! I can free my hands to do other things. I love it so much! Hope you love it too."" — Philip Get it from Amazon for $11.99 (available in 26 colors and patterns). Promising review: ""I travel extensively and often desire to spice up the food along the way.

It saved us so much stress and, I’m sure, surprise charges at the airport."" — Potter Freak ""This scale works and was accurate on four flights. The first flight was a test at 46 pounds, and Delta scales said it was 46 pounds. The next two flights were at 49 pounds, and both United and Delta found it to be 49 pounds.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/tanishtha_kotian/locals-in-europe-are-protesting-against-overtourism,travel,,Here's Why Locals In Europe Are Protesting Against Overtourism,9,241,4,18,"The Louvre shutting down is one of the several symptoms of unmanageable tourist crowds, which has been a problem for years. BuzzFeed Staff These protests are being carried out in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, as locals remain frustrated with the number of tourists that flock down during prime seasons. Several protestors have stated that they are not against tourism , but would rather have it on a more acceptable scale. The Louvre, which has a capacity of 30,000 visitors at a time, had 8.7 million visitors last year, testing the infrastructure's capacity. The staff revealed that working in the museum was a 'physical ordeal' as there were limited bathroom breaks, sparce rest areas, and increased heat in the museum due to the museum's greenhouse effect. The protest has reignited the discussion of overtourism and how it is not a 'new' problem, but one that has been simmering under the surface for a while. Another chapter in the tragedy of overtourism: Capri Today, one of Italy’s 🇮🇹 major newspapers ran this headline: “Capri declares war! 50,000 arrivals a day” This is sheer madness https://t.co/hh251GgrJs pic.twitter.com/scx0kmqgRR  In May 2025, the government had called for the removal of nearly 66,000 rental listings on Airbnb, on the grounds that they breached tourist regulations. This announcement would be a breath of relief, as housing has been a issue in the country due to sky-rocketing rental prices, preference for tourist apartments, and incomes which cannot match up.

Despite all the rave reviews, I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion, I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly, all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and made a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips need them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again — these are worth every damn penny. Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.98 . Promising review : ""After having my luggage being 'lost' or delayed one too many times, I had had enough. I vowed to travel overseas with only a carry-on and did so using these compression packing cubes! I was able to be so organized and had room for my purchases. I was worried that the clothes would come out a pile of wrinkles, but after searching all about how to pack compression cubes, I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived after my 15-hour flight. I'm not sure how I lived before."" — family fun Get a pack of six from Amazon for $39.96 (available in eight colors and smaller pack sizes as well). Promising review : ""This cosmetics bag was a LIFESAVER when I traveled abroad this summer. The compartments are a great size, and it was able to hold quite a bit of travel-size items inside.

Promising review: ""Seeing as this has been my wallet for THREE YEARS, I thought I should write a review. I bought this wallet before a trip to Europe in 2017. It held my money, my passport, coins, a pen, everything, just fine. After my trip, I guess I just never stopped using it! All things considered, it’s held up pretty well!

Here's what former BuzzFeeder Jasmin Sandal has to say about it: ""I gotta say, I love the concept of the Pen Pal from Alleyoop ! After using all of the functions (eyeliner, highlighter, lip liner, eyebrow pencil) and as someone who LOVES makeup but was applying as little as humanly possible during lockdown, I think it’s a great tool for anyone looking to streamline their routine. It's ideal to use for touchups come the end of the work day, or a subtle, minimalist way to apply makeup in the a.m. The brow pencil is particularly soft and pigmented, and filled in my eyebrows quickly. I just adore the ease of application of each product, and appreciate the universal, does-it-all-for-you concept. Plus, it saves me so much room in my already-overflowing makeup bag!"" Get it from Amazon or Alleyoop for $20 (available in three shades). Promising review: ""I love this product. I took it on a recent vacation and it really is a time saver. The moisturizer bar it comes with is soo nice. I usually get a little itchy after shaving but the fact that you can rub in the excess product on the shaved area has helped with itch and ingrown hairs. Now that I'm not on vacation, I use it right before I go to the pool, I seriously take this thing everywhere."" — Karlie Hanson Get it from Amazon for $15 (available in two colors).

Promising review : ""I’ve been using this backpack for a little over a year now, and it is AMAZING. It’s still intact after many trips and carrying around . It has a large capacity (I’ve put up to five days' worth of outfits inside) and many pockets to stay organized. The quality is [super] good, and the zippers are working perfectly. It holds its shape after many uses, too. It’s easy to clean, and again, it has been the perfect companion for me every week."" — Lau HG Get it from Amazon for $41.99+ (available in 11 colors and five sizes). Promising review: ""When I travel, I'm so bad about hydrating. It's so hard to find water, and water bottles can be hard to lug around. Not this one!

It fits easily in your carry-on without taking up any room, then you can fill it part security. Best travel purchase I've made!

Hackwith Design House is a woman-owned small business that creates made-to-order apparel. This shirt can be worn as a V-neck, off-the-shoulder, boatneck, V-back, and even open as a jacket. And the color is simple, which means it can be paired well with many different bottoms. BuzzFeed Shopping editor Chelsea Stuart says: ""I have this shirt and I *love* it. All credit for its discovery goes to TikToker @jennifer.bianca , whom I happened to stumble across on my FYP. It checks all my boxes: black, comfortable, versatile, and durable. My initial worry was that I wouldn't feel secure in it (I have a 38DDD chest, and most wrap tops/dresses I've tried haven't stayed where they're supposed to), but I haven't had an issue with this! I've worn it tied in the front, giving me a square neck (like the left picture) and tied in the back, giving me a V-neck up front (just like the photo on the right) — both were super comfortable, and I didn't have to adjust myself at all. As someone whose weight fluctuates, I also appreciate that this piece can handle pounds gained and lost. The fabric is medium weight, so I'll be wearing it season to season, and there's just enough elasticity in the arms that if you roll up your sleeves, they won't fall back down. All that is to say, trust that I will be buying additional colors!"" Get it from Hackwith Design House for $145 (available in women's sizes XS–4X and in three colors). This has four different compartments, with one of them having a zippered closure! Bonus: This works with your existing suitcase, unlike versions of this that come pre-built into more expensive versions! Promising review: ""I was able to pack seven outfits and have way more space in this organizer. I just packed the clothes in the organizer, closed it up, and placed it in my carry-on. Once I got to the hotel, I just hung it in my closet. It would be perfect for cruises since there is never any drawer space and very little room to move around."" — jess Get it from Amazon for $28.20+ (available in six colors and several sets). Promising review: ""This case has been amazing for storing my earbuds, various loose cable connectors, chargers, etc . I am using it right now on a trip, and it has been fantastic for keeping these items in one convenient, organized place . It is lightweight and fits easily into my one carry-on item when boarding the many flights I am taking. I’m pretty sure I will still be using it to keep all these items together and more easy to locate when I return home! I am so glad I bought this !"" — V. Elia Get it from Amazon for $9.85+ (available in three sizes and 23 colors). Promising review: "" My husband and I have different phones with different charging ports. This was great for our international travel and limiting the number of cords we needed to carry. Was useful during travel for charging both devices and other family members' devices. Quick charging as well."" — veronicawhite Get it from Amazon for $11.99 . Beauty Goodies is a small business that specializes in chic storage and travel accessories. Promising review: ""This garment bag is an exceptional value for the money. Well built, top quality materials, including 'beefy' zippers, should hold up well for airline travel. Minimal wrinkles, if any, in garments, and a cavernous bag for storing shoes and other items for a trip. Added bonus, it fits easily in the plane overhead storage, similar in size to a standard roller bag . I highly recommend this product."" — Kindle Customer Get it from Amazon for $40.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""I bought these for a trip for my family of five. I like to plan in advance to make sure no one forgets anything! These were a lifesaver packing for three kids!

Would definitely recommend if you need to travel with family and need to set things out and pack."" — mommyandbri Get a 30-pack from Amazon for $14.99 (available in five different pack sizes). Promising review : ""I love this! The quality is very nice, and it fits great. W ore it last week in the rain with a coat I love that doesn't have a hood, and it was perfect . It slips right under your jacket, so all you see is the hood, so it pretty much blends in with your jacket. Such a great idea! Wish there were more colors and patterns, I'd order more."" — Jill Hammel Get it from Amazon for $29 (available in two sizes). JetBag is a small business based in Michigan! Promising review: ""Bought to bring wine from France home from vacation. We bought three bottles (one of which was champagne). All three made it on the Eurostar and two flights in perfect condition."" — Katie Get a set of three from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in four styles). Plus!!!!! This is also dual voltage, which is so handy when traveling internationally! Promising review: ""Don't be fooled by the tiny price or size, this little baby is serious. If you are looking for a small travel option rather than lugging your big straightener and giant curling iron around the world, then I think you'll love this. It performs really well, turning my frizzy, wavy hair into a smooth and sleek style. The curling iron option also creates shiny, silky, lasting curls! It's easy to transition between both. I also like the grippy handle and the fact that the curling iron clip is a different color than the straightening bars, because that helps me see how I should be maneuvering it around. The voltage goes up to 240V, so you are good using it internationally without a converter (but you will need an adapter just to fit it into various foreign outlets). At this price, definitely give it a try and flaunt your tresses abroad."" — Christine Get it from Amazon for $39.99+ (available in two colors). Promising review: ""I always have my Kindle Paperwhite with me when traveling or just sitting at the beach to read. Recently, we traveled to a tropical wedding destination, I was sitting by the pool reading when my daughter's boyfriend sat down with his book and said he was almost finished reading it, he was complaining that he wanted to bring more, but they would be too heavy. I showed him my Kindle and said that I loaded five books into it for the trip , he was was very interested and amazed after I let him play with it. So now, he's getting one for Christmas."" — Steve M. Get it from Amazon for $159.99 (available in three colors and with or without lock screen ads). The ""daily routine"" set includes four medium and three small capsules as well as magnetic, interchangeable labels for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, moisturizer, cleanser, a pill icon, and a blank tile. They also offer skincare , bodycare , haircare , and pill case sets, as well as extenders that increase the size of the capsule! And if you fall in love with these and *really* want to customize your collection, head to their site to build your own unique set. Cadence is an AAPI woman-owned small business that was founded by Steph Hon with the goal of eliminating single-use travel-sized plastics. The containers are made from recycled ocean-bound plastic. Promising review : ""These containers are perfectly sized for all my travel needs, whether it’s skincare products, vitamins, or even small jewelry pieces. They fit neatly into my carry-on, saving space and keeping everything organized. No more messy toiletry bags or digging around for tiny items — everything has its place with Cadence. The quality of the materials is top-notch. The containers snap together securely, making it easy to keep them organized and prevent any spills. It’s such a clever and practical feature that adds a touch of luxury to the whole experience. Plus, it’s oddly satisfying to hear the little click when they snap into place! ""I’ll be honest — the price did give me pause at first. These containers are definitely an investment, but I can confidently say they’re worth it. The peace of mind they provide, knowing my products are safe and secure during travel, is priceless. Plus, the high-quality build means they’ll last for many trips to come, making them a smart long-term investment."" — Randy G.

I am so excited to give it to her. She will love the Rome skyline and all the goodies inside."" — Jen Get it from Anne Cate for $25 (available in 96 skylines). Promising review: ""I originally bought these for traveling purposes so I did not have to carry my full-size perfume bottles, but now they are a daily use item and keep them in my purse so that way I can always refresh my favorite scents. TSA approved small and convenient."" — Tee63143 Get a four-pack from Amazon for $7.99 (available in two color sets and five-packs). Promising review : "" Game changer for travel! We were gone for two weeks, and I was able to wash all the clothes I had packed! Helped with using only a carry-on for the trip and kept my clothes fresh and clean! So easy to use and smelled nice!

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/carolinebologna/doctors-tips-avoid-getting-sick-traveling-flying-vacation-sc,travel,,"""I Always Travel With This"": Doctors Are Sharing The Illness-Avoiding Practices They Always Implement While Traveling, And They're So Important",20,1659,4,10,"There are ways to reduce your chances of coming home from vacation with a terrible cold, digestive issues or other health problems. HuffPost Writer When travelers return home from a vacation, they typically bring cool souvenirs, cherished memories and a broadened perspective on the world. But sometimes they also come home with a terrible cold, digestive problems or other health issues. It’s common to get sick when you travel, whether you come down with symptoms during the trip or start feeling bad after the return. But this outcome doesn’t have to be inevitable. “You can assume that travel will increase the risk of getting sick, and none of us wants to get sick while traveling, said Dr. Henry M. Wu , an associate professor at Emory University School of Medicine and director of the Emory TravelWell Center. “It makes sense to take extra precautions we don’t do on a daily basis.” Below, Wu and other doctors share the things they always do when they travel to avoid getting sick. “Although COVID is no longer as large of an issue as it was, given that I am in close quarters with the same circulating air on an airplane, I still wear a mask on all flights and in the airport,” said Dr. Barbara Bawer , a family medicine physician at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. “Depending on where you are going, wearing a mask in crowded places is also important.” She suggested packing at least a couple of masks in case one gets soiled or ruined. High-quality masks like N95s are your best bet for reducing germ transmission in crowded indoor situations. “I still lament the time I sat on an overnight train in France across from a couple that coughed and sneezed the entire trip — only to get a horrible cold a day later and miss the 48-hour French countryside wedding extravaganza I had traveled so far to attend,” said Dr. Sarah Battistich , an emergency medicine specialist with NYU Langone Health’s Virtual Urgent Care. “Now I routinely wear masks in transit, whether or not there are identifiably ill persons around me.” Face coverings can also offer protection in multiple ways. “The mask will keep you from touching your nose and mouth with your hands,” said Dr. Heather Viola , a primary care physician at Mount Sinai Doctors-Ansonia. “First and foremost, I constantly wash my hands, always carrying with me hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol to prevent the spread of germs,” Viola said. “Many airlines are giving out alcohol-based disinfectant wipes when you board. I use these to clean my seat, headrest, armrests, tray table, and entertainment screen — basically, anything you may touch while sitting in your seat.” Packing your own alcohol-based disinfecting wipes can also be useful. “I am a big proponent obviously of hand washing,” Battistich said. “But also trying to limit touching of shared surfaces and therefore limit the risk of coming into contact with bacteria and viruses. I make a game out of it with my daughter to not touch any surface in public bathrooms, including doors and toilet seats.” “If I’m taking a long flight, try to start out well hydrated and avoid alcohol on the plane,” Battistich said. Maintaining a healthy water intake was a priority for all the doctors who spoke to HuffPost. “I always travel with electrolytes ― packets of dissolvable electrolytes ― for water or vitamin water,” Viola said. “This is a good way to keep hydrated with more than just water and help prevent in-flight nausea or dehydration.” Viola is also a fan of nasal mists and vitamin C tablets prior to boarding. “The plane cabin is dry, and microorganisms are free to circulate in the air, so before I go on a plane, I take a few vitamin C tablets to boost my immune system and help give my body the ability to fight off airborne germs,” she said. “Nasal saline spray or nasal mists can also help fight germs as they keep your nasal passages moist, which enhances your body’s own germ-flushing activity. You can even apply a small amount of Neosporin or petroleum jelly just inside the nostrils — using a Q-tip if your hands aren’t washed — to create a barrier between you and the airborne germs.” “If possible, try to travel during non-peak times, which often is the middle of the week and mid-morning or midday, instead of very early or in the evening,” Bawer said. “This may depend on your city, though, so do some research ahead of time.” Avoiding the biggest crowds and sense of stress is a good way to cut down on your potential exposure to germs, and traveling in the middle of the day typically allows for a full night’s sleep the night before or after your flight. “Make sure to get adequate rest before your flight and if able, try to sleep while traveling when appropriate,” Bawer said. “When returning home, give yourself some time to re-adjust back to your daily schedule and environment. Try not to return home at 11 p.m. or midnight and then have to head straight to work the next day. Give yourself a few hours or, if able, an entire day at least to recover, get caught up on laundry or grocery shopping or other needed chores, and get plenty of rest.” Fatigue can impair your immune system, as well as decrease your endurance and negatively impact your mood. “I’m a big fan of those flat packable travel pillows which support your neck, and I’ve found bringing ear plugs and an eye mask or scarf to keep out the lights is super helpful for getting that extra bit of rest — like that hour at the end of a night flight where you still want to sleep but the flight crew turns the bright overheads on,” Battistich said. Resting is a key component to a healthy immune system. Just as you should prioritize rest to help your immune system, you should also try to reduce stress where possible. “Don’t overschedule your trip to allow time to enjoy yourself and give some flexibility in the itinerary,” Bawer advised. “Stress can induce sickness, especially in a new environment.” “Eat a well-balanced diet leading up to the trip to get your body and immune system ready to fight anything it comes into contact with and on the day of travel as well,” Bawer said. “Most people don’t eat as healthy while on vacation but try to incorporate fruits and vegetables with all meals to keep your immune system at the highest level.” She always packs healthy snacks and a refillable water bottle to ensure she gets the nutrients she needs during her travels. “Often we don’t have time to eat, especially with flights being delayed or late, and we either skip meals or grab something quick, which is rarely healthy,” Bawer noted. “I make sure I am up-to-date on vaccines before travel,” Wu said. “Flu and COVID-19 are so common among travelers, and even a mild case can ruin a trip. Also, for international travel, there are additional vaccines that might be recommended or required, or even malaria prophylaxis for some areas. I suggest travelers check the CDC [Centers for Disease Control Prevention] travel website or see a travel medicine specialist for advice.” In addition to getting the necessary travel vaccines ahead of time, you may want to procure special medications in advance. “Consider getting a prescription for diarrhea medicine if traveling to another country where traveler’s diarrhea may be an issue,” Bawer advised. “If traveling to another country, avoid drinking their water — this includes anything washed with local water like salad and fruit. Focus on eating foods that have a shell and don’t need washing and drink bottled water. Also, use this to brush your teeth. This can help to avoid traveler’s diarrhea from developing.” Packing an over-the-counter anti-diarrheal like Imodium is another good idea, especially when traveling internationally. “If I’m uncertain about particular meals, I try to stick to foods that have been fully cooked and are served hot, avoiding raw and undercooked foods,” Viola added. “Wear sunscreen daily,” Bawer urged. Whether at home or on vacation, you should apply (and reapply) a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30 every day. Keeping up with your sun protection regimen is especially important if you’ll spend a lot of time outside during your travels. “Sunburn and heat-related illnesses are some of the most easily preventable causes of a ruined vacation,” Battistich said. “Don’t forget sunscreen, long sleeve shirts ― linen is great for hot climates ― and hats. The bigger and more packable the hat, the better.“ “If it’s an outdoorsy trip or I’m going to tropical areas, I make sure to pack bug repellent,” Wu said. “Mosquitoes, ticks and other biting bugs can transmit many infections.” Ensure your sunscreen complies with local regulations and check the CDC’s recommendations for effective products. “It isn’t always easy to find these things on the fly, so preparing in advance will eliminate the chance I am caught off guard,” Wu added. “I also bring over-the-counter medications that I will have on hand in case I start to feel unwell,” Viola said. She packs acetaminophen for pain or fever, ibuprofen for pain, an antihistamine like Benadryl and Pepto-Bismol in case of stomach upset. “My doctor’s travel kit included some preventatives and some emergency rescue meds,” Battistich said, listing many of the same medications, as well as anti-nausea medications and remedies like SeaBands, ginger packets, and aromatherapy sticks. “There is evidence that taking Pepto-Bismol tablets before and during travel can help reduce in the risk of traveler’s diarrhea,” she added. “I also back very basic wound kits with Band-Aids, antibiotic cream, and if going to a hot and humid climate, or when hiking and backpacking, I will also often bring an antifungal cream.” This post originally appeared on HuffPost .",2025-06-24T17:49:37.847978+00:00

Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Consider this your packing checklist for the next few months. BuzzFeed Staff Promising review: ""Got this delivered yesterday. Immediately tried it on and it is fantastic! It adjusts if need be and looks so cute on. I love the ability to use the strap on windy days. My ensemble is complete with the hat, a new spring sundress and new sandals! Thank you!"" — Kathleen Get it from Amazon for $24.69+ (available in two sizes and eight colors). Each pack comes with three packets. And, because they *are* liquid, they'll easily slide into the side of your toiletries bag. Promising review : ""Game changer for travel! We were gone for two weeks, and I was able to wash all the clothes I had packed! Helped with using only a carry-on for the trip and kept my clothes fresh and clean! So easy to use and smelled nice! Will never travel without them again!"" — Kristy Get nine packs from Amazon for $6.26 (also available in packs of three and six). You can also use the handle to prop it up like a desk fan! See a TikTok of the handheld mini fan in action. Promising review: ""Bought this after seeing it on TikTok, and wow. Where has this been all my life? A portable charger (extra, because I already have one), a fan with two settings (this kept me cool during my brother’s outdoor college graduation), and a flashlight (perfect for finding my phone when I drop it in my car). It’s a great little thing that adds that extra EXTRA-ness to your life. "" — Angie Get it from Amazon for $15.29+ (available in six colors). I recently replaced an old adhesive phone wallet with this and WOW this is an 11/10 upgrade. I'm a huge fun of phone wallets — after losing my regular wallet a few too many times, I realized that keeping it attached to my phone was a genius idea since I always have my phone in hand and in sight. The magnet on this is super strong, so I never worry about it falling off. Unlike my old wallet, this one has a small opening at the bottom that makes it easy to push my cards up for easy access (I used to spend an embarrassingly long time trying to fish my ID out of my old one). I can fit three cards in the front pocket, then one in each of the two pockets inside. Oh, and it works perfectly as a stand. I am so excited to prop my phone up and catch up on And Just Like That on my next flight. Promising review: ""When I was trying to simplify and condense my wallet while traveling to Europe, I came across this great concept to use the MagSafe wallet and only carry necessary cards/ID with me... It worked great and this would be the permanent solution for me going forward."" — TK Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors and with or without a grip). Promising review: ""Hate dragging out the old hotel iron and board, so I just spray my wrinkled clothes with this, and voila! Takes the wrinkles out, and off I go — no wrestling while putting the iron and board away. I even have a small travel iron or use my hair styling irons if I want a better finish, but this usually does the job nicely."" — Audie Get it from Amazon for $6.05 . Promising review: ""Made very well. Nice breathable fabric that isn’t too thick/heavy but also isn’t cheap or too thin. It’s very soft, lightweight, and flows nicely. Nice quality. I’m always extremely skeptical about elastic waists because they can kill a look; I was ECSTATIC to find that this isn’t your average elastic waist. It gathers just enough to give definition between the torso and hips and isn’t even close to being too tight or snug around the waist. Seriously, I was so excited. The off-shoulder neckline is sexy and feminine, and living in Arizona, between having a shoulder exposed and putting my hair up, it makes me feel 50% cooler in the hot temps. Love it."" — Holly Get it from Amazon for $37.99 (available in sizes S–3XL and 31 other colors). These are available in three formulas: a Hyaluronic formula for extra moisture, a Retinol formula to help promote faster skin cell turnover, and a Vitamin C formula to brighten and even skin tone. Promising review: ""Love these! I purchased for an international flight to avoid liquids. I expected to use them on the hiking trip and go back to my usual cleanser once home. But instead, they are now my usual cleanser. The ease of dampening one fingertip and tapping on the top cleanser square beats squirting a liquid cleanser in my hand or using a make-up remover towelette. The little squares are just the right amount and have no trash impact. They seemed pricey at first, but with the benefits, they’re worth it. I’m worth it! My skin feels clean and not tight."" — mistis Get two packs of 32 from Amazon for $17.18+ (available in three formulas). Promising review: ""Just what I needed. This worked perfectly on a recent business trip. Felt refreshing and left my skin feeling soft."" — Glenda E Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $6.88 . Promising review: ""This stuff really is awesome. It really works, and I don't know where it has been all my life. I started looking for something for thigh chafing after running into a few issues (not fun). It is super easy to use; just slide it on like you'd use deodorant."" — SweetPea BodyGlide is a small business that specializes in chafe-preventing personal care products. Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in five sizes; also available in an anti-blister balm ). Promising review: ""Perfect. Have used these for hiking and business travel. Can't imagine anyone having a bad thing to say about them."" — G. B. Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in 18 colors and six sizes). Here's what fellow BuzzFeed writer Mallory Mower (seen above!) has to say: ""As you can see above, I have big frames and they're a curious shape, so finding sunglasses that fit over them was a big win! The sunglasses have a slightly elongated lip on the upper half, helping them snuggly balance over any shape of glasses. I wore these to Disneyland and I was able to wear them, over my frames, while on rides and they stayed on! I can't recommend these enough. My husband (who wears thick square glasses) has stolen these from me, which is the biggest 5-star review I can imagine. The man is picky."" Promising review: ""These are great! They cover my glasses well and you can’t see my glasses through the lenses. The polarized lenses make colors pop while reducing the sun's brightness."" — Leigh Manuel Get them from Amazon for $24.99 (available in 21 styles). SPF: 30 Promising review: ""This small-but-very-effective stick of sunscreen was perfect for traveling with us on vacation . I took it to the beach, stuck it in my bag when we went exploring and carried it in my purse when we were in town. The smell is so good; it makes you want to take a bite out of it! I found it perfectly fine for my face, not greasy or irritating . I'll most likely buy a bigger size of lotion for my next trip as well."" — Pixie Mom Get it from Amazon for $10.49 . This can be worn on its own or over makeup. It comes in a translucent shade that's meant to work on all skin tones, and a shade called ""a touch of tan"" that adds a subtle bronze glow to light and medium skin tones. Note: Powdered sunscreens are best used for touching up, not as a replacement for traditional sunscreen (read more from the Cleveland Clinic ). If you're looking for a good sunscreen to add to your routine, check out our roundup of the best tinted sunscreens . Promising review: ""I was skeptical about the coverage of this product, but I have been using it every single day since it arrived and have yet to get sunburnt even though I spend upwards of 6 hours a day in the sun during the work week. I have also tested it on the weekend in instances where I would normally wear some sort of cream sunscreen on my face, but this seems to work just as well. For folks having concerns about coverage issue, I understand. I have been applying it by going in many circles over my face and seem to be successful with no problems. I have extremely sensitive skin along with a number of allergies and this is the first sunscreen ever that doesn't seem to break my face out at all. This will now be my go-to sunscreen for my face!"" — Silver Brush On Block is a small business specializing in SPF products. Get it from Amazon for $34+ (available in two shades, and a new formula with added vitamin C and hyaluronic acid). Promising review: ""I have two girls, and we spend a lot of time outside in the summers. I work as a nurse and have seen scalp skin cancer, and I definitely wanted to protect myself and my girls. We usually use the regular spray, but it leaves the hair greasy or stiff. This has a great scent, and a little goes a long way! I was worried about the small size, but it lasted us all summer. Also leaves no residue."" — Liz Young Get it from Amazon for $22.40 . Promising review: ""Love love love these!!! I have a lot of medications that I have to travel with and some of them are very expensive or very important and I get so worried I will lose some. These hold so many pills and have labels for each and they are so easy to open and fill but they also stay closed and seal well!"" — Britney Get a pack of four from Amazon for $6.59+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""This is a great carry-on bag! It has numerous pockets and storage areas to keep everything organized. I've taken it on three trips to Europe this year, as well as a few domestic trips, and it fits well under most airline seats (unless the seat has a footrest). In those cases, it's easy to fit it in the overhead compartment. On a couple of occasions when airlines requested that carry-on bags be checked at the gate, this bag was OK for me to carry onboard since it's not too large (yet it holds a lot). In an emergency, I was able to fit 3 days of clothes, sweaters, a jacket, toiletries, shoes, and electronics in this bag because it's so easy to organize it in numerous compartments. It wheels great, too. I've traveled a lot over the years, and this is the best carry-on bag I've found. I bought two of them!"" — DM7233 Get it from Amazon for $55.99+ (apply the $10 off coupon to get this price: available in nine colors). Promising review: ""This garment bag is an exceptional value for the money. Well built, top quality materials, including 'beefy' zippers, should hold up well for airline travel. Minimal wrinkles, if any, in garments, and a cavernous bag for storing shoes and other items for a trip. Added bonus: it fits easily in the plane overhead storage and is similar in size to a standard roller bag . I highly recommend this product."" — Kindle Customer Beauty Goodies is a small business that specializes in chic storage and travel accessories. Get it from Amazon for $40.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""This bag is very well made and water resistant. The bag has plenty of room for a laptop, papers, folders, and cords. I love that it is versatile, and I can wear it on my back or carry it like a tote bag, and it’s stylish looking!"" — michelle vastano Get it from Amazon for $21.59+ (available in five styles) Promising review : ""I travel frequently for work and keep this in my suitcase. Works great; I no longer carry a lint roller."" — Liza Przekop Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in four colors and also in packs of two or four). The set comes with four bottles, four jars, two spray bottles, two scoopers (to help transfer creams), one funnel (to help transfer liquids), one cleaning brush, a page of labels, and a bag that everything fits in. Promising review: ""I’ve purchased a lot of different travel sets for my toiletries over the years. Inevitably, they are hard to fill and tend to leak. This set was magic! The wide mouth made it easy to fill from a larger bottle, and the little scoops made transferring creams to the jar containers very easy and with much less mess. The only con (hardly worth mentioning) is that once you squeeze the bottle, it takes a few minutes to expand with air again, so the sides are a bit sunken. I solved that by unscrewing the top just a bit for a quick release of the vacuum pressure. I had no leaks, and plenty of containers for every toiletry."" — MDC Get it from Amazon for $8.49+ (available in eight colors). Promising reviews: ""I use this brush daily and during trips. I like travel-sized brushes because the teeth tend to be spaced further apart and work better for my curls. This brush is waterproof, so it works great in the shower. Also good for kids with lots of tangles."" — DG ""My son has 4c hair and brushes I’ve tried before break his curls and would take forever to detangle his hair! This brush right here cuts the time in half and glides right through!"" — Elizabeth Get it from Amazon for $10.99 (available in nine shades). Promising review: ""I love this TRTL!! I first used it on a trip from Seattle to Buenos Aires and will now always use it. It made it possible for me to be comfortable on that long flight. I found it to be the best neck support in how it holds up my neck in a comfortable natural way. I love how I can use it on either side of my neck and even in the front and back of my neck. I love how I can cover my face to just below my eyes if I want privacy. It is cozy, lightweight, durable, and packs easily, or I can wrap it around my carry bag handle for quick transport. I bought one for a friend who took it on a Seattle to New York flight, and she said it was a game changer for her as she was able to sleep for the first time while flying . Now I know that with my TRTL and Bose noise-canceling headphones , I can be cramped in a middle seat on a long flight and survive in relative comfort. Thank you, TRTL!!! I just bought another one for a gift for my daughter. It is a well-designed product!"" — Amis Balcomb Get it from Amazon for $64.99+ (available in five colors). But remember that this is not a voltage converter ! Promising review: ""I am a digital nomad, so I travel full-time around the world. I have a lot of devices to charge (laptop, Kindle, phone, backup battery, portable Wi-Fi device, camera, the list goes on). A lot of times, hostel bunks or hotel rooms only have one outlet, and with the previous adapter I was using, I had to charge one device at a time. I used to literally set my alarm to wake up in the middle of the night and switch devices so that I could get more than one device fully charged overnight. I did my research finally and settled on this one because it is universal and has four USB ports. What a GAME CHANGER. On my latest trip, I was able to charge all my devices at once, and it made traveling so much smoother. It seems well made and good quality, too. Definitely recommend to my digital nomad and traveling peers. Happy travels! :)"" — Maggie A. Get it from Amazon for $15.29+ (available in two colors and an option with a UBC-C port). Promising review: ""I love this little gadget. I used it to attach my jacket and computer bag to my luggage on an extended business trip. It made my airport walks so much easier. Now that I'm back home, I've been using it daily to attach my jacket or cardigan to my work bag or purse."" — Michele Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in six colors and packs of two). The travel belt is adjustable to 38 inches to fit most bags. The belt itself is vegan leather with elastic accents and a quick-release buckle. Promising review: ""Love this! I am constantly struggling between holding my jacket and two carry-ons. This is the perfect solution! I can’t wait to start using it when I’m back to regular business travel."" — Allison Cincha Travel is a small business in California that develops adjustable travel belts made out of vegan leather. The brand donates 100 airline miles for each purchase, which are used to reconnect separated migrant families. Plus, they were featured on Shark Tank, where they made a deal with Barbara! Get it from Amazon (available in 17 styles) and Cincha Travel (available in 25 styles) for $39.99. Each set comes with a small, medium, large, and extra-large cube, a shoe bag, and a laundry bag. Reviewers also mention using these to organize drawers when they're not traveling. Promising review: ""I have been on the fence about buying packing cubes for two years! I wasn’t sure if they would really make a difference in my packing or not. However, I am so glad I decided to get some! I have looked at many brands, but I am happy I decided on this one! These are made from a great material and are super cute! This is one of the few brands that include both a shoe bag and a dirty linen bag!... I was actually able to close my luggage with ease for the first time. These keep your clothes clean and organized. It makes packing and unpacking a breeze. "" — Cindy U. Get a set of eight from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in 11 colors). Promising review : ""TikTok told me this compared to Lululemon, and it’s true, it is. Love this little bag! And the price — you can’t beat it."" — Jolie BuzzFeed Shopping editor Elizabeth Lilly also owns this — she packed it as her only bag for a trip to busy trip to Iceland, and not only did it hold a ton and keep her hands free, but it easily fit around her waist over her outerwear. Get it from Amazon for $11.68+ (available in 45 colors). Promising review: ""I bought these to put into my bag/pocket to carry around, just in case. Sometimes public restrooms do not have soap, and that is extremely inconvenient. These come in super handy! One sheet is definitely enough for me, and it’s so cool to watch it turn from a dry sheet of paper into sudsy soap with water added. I 100% recommend."" — woolymammoth Fomin is a small business specializing in cleaning products. Get them from Amazon for $7.98+ (available in four scents and various pack sizes). Promising review : ""This cup holder is perfect! It helps me a lot! Last time I took a plane with a suitcase and a cup of coffee, I dropped and spilled my drink everywhere when it was my turn to check my passport and ticket. It was a nightmare! This time, I bought this cup holder to do me a favor! I don't have to worry about where my cup and phone are! I can free my hands to do other things. I love it so much! Hope you love it too."" — Philip Get it from Amazon for $11.39+ (available in 26 styles, including styles with a strap). Promising review: ""I bought these for a long holiday where I anticipated hiking in remote areas without the opportunity to do a whole cleanup at a hotel before going out for dinner. Tho I was never quite that dirty/smelly, even on regular days in the city that were unexpectedly humid or travel days of hopping between airports and train stations, these came in clutch to make sure constant freshness was a quick wipe away."" — candi Get a pack of 10 from Amazon for $12.99 . The wallet has a passport pocket, a boarding pass compartment, three credit card slots, an ID slot, a slim card pouch, a slim pocket, a ticket slot, a cellphone pouch, a coin zippered pocket, a key holder, and a pen holder. The all-in-one holder could also arguably be considered a cult-favorite travel product . Promising review: ""Guys, I'm beyond happy with this. I've been looking for a passport and ticket holder for a while, but had never found the right size until I decided to try out this one. Besides, the material feels high quality and long-lasting, the red color is even better in person, and it's wildly pretty."" — BazantSol Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 25 colors). You can also get a single AirTag for $24.99 . Promising review: ""While on a delayed flight from Newark to Dublin, I could see one of my bags was not on the plane. This was great information because when we arrived in Dublin, I was able to be the first one in line to file a missing bag claim."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $74.99 . Promising review: ""This is my second purchase! The first was a gift to my bf, and I liked it, so I bought one for myself. Slim and lightweight, it goes perfectly in a purse or pocket. I like that I can charge three things at the same time and that one of the outlets is a C-type."" — CaptGellyfish Get it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I have very wide feet, hammer toes, big ankles, and very tender feet that never recovered from bunion surgery. With these shoes, I was able to walk around San Francisco with just a couple of corn pads and not be in excruciating pain at the end of the day. With my wide ankles, it takes a bit of doing to get these shoes on, but once I do, they are comfortable everywhere. Lots of ankle support so my feet stay put but give my toes wiggle room. I ordered a 1/2 size larger than usual to give my toes the room they need. There is also room for orthotics."" — Julie Get it from Amazon for $33.29+ (available in sizes 5.5–11 and 23 colors). Check out a TikTok of the dry shampoo in action. Promising review: ""Will be buying again!! This is a fantastic product. I have incredibly thin hair that gets very oily very easily. This is the first product that I’ve tried that actually works! I am so very happy!"" — Katie_0_Baker Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in brown, dark brown, blonde, and in multipacks and bundles). Promising review: ""You can totally fit three pairs of shoes in this! (Size 6.5 women's shoe, fits heels, wedges, and sandals.) I bought two and will absolutely be buying more for my husband. 10/10 would recommend! I travel frequently, and I always overpack; this helped cut down space and stress immensely! "" — Taylor Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in nine colors and patterns). I'm obsessed with my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush (and so is my dentist!), but it's just way too bulky to stuff in my already over-stuffed carry-on when I'm traveling. I decided to try this out on a recent trip and was super impressed with how well it works. I love that it has a two-minute timer built in (with reminders to switch quadrants every 30 seconds), and it gives a nice, gentle vibration. For under $20, this is a great alternative to lugging around a bulky rechargeable toothbrush and way better than most flimsy travel toothbrushes.

Bonus: they last a full 24 hours on a charge and come with an old-school cord for when Bluetooth isn't an option. Get them from Amazon for $249 (available in eight colors).

These are my go-to shoes for long travel days: they’re lightweight, breathable, ridiculously comfy, and slip off in a second at security. Bonus: they rinse off easily if you spill your coffee mid-flight. When I’m running late I convert them to “sport mode,” utilizing the strap on the back to keep the shoes in place. Get them from Amazon for $37.94+ (available in women's sizes 4–19, men's sizes 2–17, and tons of colors). After long flights or cramped car rides, I use this compact massage gun on every trip. The Hypervolt Go 2 may be travel-sized (it weighs only 1.5 pounds), but it packs a serious punch when it comes to loosening tight shoulders, calves, or that weird spot in your back from sleeping uncomfortably on a plane. It’s lightweight, portable and easy to pack into a backpack. Get it from Amazon for $139 (available in two colors). Some bulk hand sanitizer might seem like an obvious choice for this list, but it absolutely cannot be skipped. I fly with a few — tucked into my pocket, backpack, and fanny pack. Purell’s formula kills 99.99% of germs without wrecking your hands (it’s free of harsh, drying ingredients like parabens and triclosan), and the adorably named “jelly wrap” holder makes it easy to clip onto a bag for quick cleanups. Get an 8-pack from Amazon for $14.99 . This fanny pack is definitely an original – each one is handmade in the Philippines from repurposed materials, so no two are alike. I don’t trust my loose pockets on a plane, so all of my valuables (wallet, passport) will be kept safely in my fanny pack. I wear mine crossbody for easy access in the airport and always get compliments. Get it from Amazon for $27. This is the water bottle that’s survived every trip, tumble, and TSA bin I’ve put it through. The YETI bottle keeps water ice-cold for hours, and it’s totally leakproof — so I never have to worry about it soaking the rest of my bag. It’s hefty but easy to carry, and the wide mouth works great for easy refills. Hydration station, secured. Get it from YETI for $32+ (available in three sizes and 148 colors). I’ve tested more travel pillows than I care to admit, and the Ostrichpillow Go is the one I actually use. The high-density memory foam molds to your neck like it was custom-made, and the 360-degree ergonomic design means no more awkwa6rd head bobs or waking up with a crick in your neck. I used it on a 14-hour flight to South Africa and I slept eight hours. It compresses down small enough to stash in your bag, but still offers full support. Get it from Amazon for $63.64 (available in three colors). This is the suitcase I take when I want to pack a little extra without checking a bag. This popular suitcase from Away fits in most US airlines’ overhead bins, but gives you more space thanks to its interior compression system. It’s sleek, durable, and glides through airports smoothly. I’ve brought mine to more than 10 different countries and it still feels brand new. Get it from Away Travel for $295 (available in 10 colors). Sadly, more and more new aircrafts are dropping their built-in televisions , so my iPad has become my in-flight entertainment center. Before the flight, I download all of my movies and shows so I have hours worth of mindless content to consume from 35,000 feet in the air. It’s lightweight but powerful, with enough battery to last from wheels up to touchdown and then some. Get it from Amazon for $299+ (available in two three storage sizes and four colors). This little wand has become my secret weapon for looking decent after a red-eye. The device chills in seconds to zap under-eye puffiness, then switches to heat to boost circulation. I use it mid-flight, post-flight, or even just when I’m feeling a little dull — it’s like giving your face a reset button. I always have it in my fanny pack onboard and it instantly makes me feel fresh again after sitting in my seat for hours. Get it from Amazon for $169.99 (available in two colors).",2025-06-24T17:49:42.771362+00:00
BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/habibakatsha1/ghana-adventure-trip,travel,,Ghana Isn't Just For Partying – 7 Things To Experience The Rich Ghanaian Culture Without A Nightclub In Sight,19,939,4,4,"If you want to soak in more than just cocktails and sunshine, this one's for you. HuffPost Writer In 2018, I had the pleasure of travelling to Ghana with my sister and a family friend for a wedding. It was my first time on the continent as an adult. I’ll always remember how it felt to be surrounded by so many people who looked just like me for the first time. Though the wedding was the main event, I managed to fit in some time to explore Ghana. It’s a trip I’ll never forget, but I left not knowing much about Ghana or its people. So, when the opportunity to revisit Ghana with Intrepid (specifically cities outside of Accra) came up, I jumped at the chance. Traveling to Ghana during December has become increasingly popular among the Black diaspora in recent years, thanks to the ""Year of Return"" initiative—the year marking 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the Americas. In 2019, the Ghanaian government created The Year of Return as a way to encourage the Black diaspora to visit Ghana. Although it was initially intended as a time to explore the country, visiting Ghana in December has become synonymous with partying. While it’s great that the people in the diaspora are becoming more intentional about visiting African countries, we should remember that Ghana is more than a party destination. The Intrepid trip is an excellent example of that. Five hours away from Accra lies the Volta region, near the border of Togo. Though the journey was long, it allowed me to see how beautiful Ghana is. Eventually, we made our way to our home for the next two days: Tagbo Falls Lodge, also labelled as  'home away from home.' I wouldn't describe myself as someone who loves nature, but this trip, especially my time at Tagbo Falls Lodge, made me fall in love with it. Tagbo Falls Lodge is situated in the small village of Liati Wot, which is home to approximately 600 residents. It's perfect for those who want to take a hike, visit a mountain, or see the infamous waterfall. Hailed as one of the tallest waterfalls in West Africa, Tagbo Falls. If you're not a fan of bats, this one isn't for you because there are plenty of them here. It's a 45-minute walk to get to the waterfall, but once you're there, you'll be mesmerized by the scenery. With stunning views, breathtaking greenery, and the sound of water running over the rocks, it's a great way to unwind and forget about the world's worries. We’re all aware of the transatlantic slave trade, but how many of us actually know what happened during that time? As I mentioned, I visited Elmina Castle during my trip to Ghana in 2018. I remember it being such a heavy visit. I thought going to the castle for the second time around would be easier, but the horrors of the slave trade really sank in during this visit. During the tour, a tour guide will show you through the castle and provide a brief history of the transatlantic slave trade. “The door of no return” was the most chilling part of the tour for me, as it was the last thing Africans would see before they were shipped to the Americas. It is not an easy visit by any means, but it is one that everyone should make once in their lifetime. After spending a few days in Ghana, you'll notice something: Ghanaians love funerals. I lost count of the number of signs I saw highlighting the anniversary of someone's death or funeral. It's an odd concept to wrap your head around if you live in the West. Part of making sure you're ready for your funeral is making sure you have the swankiest coffin you can buy. We then visited Eric Kpakpo Adotey at Fantasy Coffin, where he showcased some of the extravagant coffins he had created. It's refreshing to see that, although death is a sad occasion, Ghanaians make sure to go out in style. Maybe, if you're lucky enough, Eric would design a coffin for you. Everyone has different priorities when it comes to holidays. Some people want to relax, others want to party, and I can’t go abroad without visiting an exhibition or museum. So I was excited to visit the Artists Alliance Gallery to see the art created by Ghanaians. The gallery showcases paintings, fine pottery, sculptures, wall hangings, Kente cloth, masks, beads, and a diverse range of textiles. We were shown around by the gallery curator, who provided the historical context of the paintings and sculptures we saw. If you’re into art, this one is for you. As a Londoner, the concept of going to a market at night doesn’t make sense to me. However, after visiting Osu Night Market, I’m now petitioning for all markets to be open at night. Think of Osu night market as a 24/7 food hall. It’s open all day and runs until the early hours of the morning. It's so popular that that some people visit the market for food after a night out. We tasted fresh food, visited a bar, and spoke to the locals. It’s a great way to spend your evening after a long day. One of the highlights of my trip, hands down, was the food. Being Congolese, most sub-Saharan African foods share similarities, so I wasn't a stranger to eating fufu or tilapia. As we walked through Jamestown, we picked up ingredients to make Kenkey and were taught how to prepare it. It wasn't easy, but the outcome was delicious.",2025-06-24T17:49:43.364576+00:00

Promising review : ""I was hesitant to buy these because most sandals that are made of 'rubber' will have your foot slip-sliding around with even a bit of sweat (remember those '80s jelly shoes?!) Well, these are NOTHING like that. They are very comfortable and fit my wide foot well. I worried they might squeak or the back strap might flop about. Nope. None of that.

Promising review: ""I usually wear a 7.5 women's and these in size 7 are perfect. This is my second pair (in white) to go with more outfits.

I highly recommend!"" — Leah Gwin Hoefling ""These shoes were recommended as comfortable walking shoes. They absolutely are the best!

My first pair were basic black, and they still look good after about eight years of wear. I bought these was because I loved how the gold straps looked, and two years after buying them, they are without a doubt my most-worn shoe!! That's me on the left on my honeymoon — I wore them all throughout Italy, whether we were on the beach, on a boat tour, or walking around cities for miles on end. I love wearing them with dresses because the gold really *pops* and you end up feeling so comfortable, unlike when I wear less supportive sandals or heels. To make these last even longer, don't forget to use their shoe care kit to protect the cork and make the shoe waterproof!"" Get them from Amazon for $87.63+ (available in sizes 8–12.5 and in four colors/styles) or Birkenstock for $110+ (available in sizes 4–17.5 and hundreds of colors/styles).

They're also simple enough to slip on and off when going through the airport so they check all of my travel boxes! Promising review : ""Love these shoes! I saw them in store at UO, but they didn't have my size. Obviously, I turned to Amazon because what doesn’t this site sell, and lo and behold, y’all had it. I try to pair these with almost every outfit because they’re so comfy and stylish! Recently went to Philly, where I had to walk everywhere because we didn't rent a car, and these were the only pair of shoes I brought (I travel light). These didn’t cramp up my feet at all as I walked over seven hours daily over the course of five days. Definitely recommend! But one thing hurts my heart...the creasing at the front of the shoe that comes with loving these shoes so much.😢"" — Alli J Get them from Amazon for $52.64+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in various colors/patterns). Promising review : ""I ordered these to have a neutral flat that wasn't boring. I figured they'd be great for trips and can be dressed up or down.

Promising review: ""These shoes are so comfortable, they can take me all through the work day, to dinner, and running errands on the weekend!

"" — StyleAndComfort Get it from Everlane for $148 (available in sizes 5–11 and 11 colors — not all colors available in all sizes). Promising review : ""I have three pairs of these now! They feel great. The straps are comfy. When I bought my first pair I worried the straps would make it difficult to get the shoes on and that they might be uncomfortable / cause chafing. I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable they really are though!!! I alternate the colors and wear them nearly daily now (perfect summer shoes). We went on a beach vacation...We walked for hours at a time and I never once got a blister or felt any discomfort. I didn't have any issues with my feet sliding around uncomfortably when wet (whether from sweat or when it rained). They were great for walking on the beach, too!! These are seriously the best summer shoe!"" — Stark Get them from Amazon for $29.71+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in nine colors). Those 47,000+ 5-star ratings don't lie! Promising review: "" I bought these for traveling as I wanted something comfortable and easy on/off for the airport. They totally exceeded my expectations! These flats are very comfortable.

The snakeskin print looks very nice in person."" — Allyson Cohan Get it from Amazon for $21.80 (available in sizes 5–15, including wide sizes, and 20 styles). Promising review : ""First: I hate flip-flops...I always break them or twist them sideways somehow. These are not your typical flip-flops. These are the most comfortable flip-flop sandals I’ve ever owned. I love these shoes! The extra strap makes all the difference in added comfort. I ordered these to take on vacation for wearing to/from the pool. Ended up not even unpacking the other shoes I packed. These were so comfortable and versatile that not only were they pool shoes, but also walking on the beach shoes and dinner shoes. I love them so much I’ll be ordering more in different colors."" — Ian R. Get them from Amazon for $24.95+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in 14 colors/patterns). Promising review : ""I travel to warm weather destinations and do a lot of walking. Chacos are my go-to travel shoes . They do take some time to break in, so have the bandages ready for the first week or so, but once you break them in, they're amazing. Supportive enough for long days of walking, but they also let your feet breathe."" — Erica Get them from Amazon for $104.95+ (available in sizes 5–12, including wide sizes, and in five styles). Laboo Leather is a family-owned small biz based in Budapest, Hungary, making handmade leather sandals and wallets. Promising reviews: ""I adore my sandals!

Thank you, Sorel, for creating a comfortable, great quality yet trendy, artistic sandal! I have very sensitive arches that need support, and my feet are wide. I have had these for 3 years now, and I couldn't help but write a review. They have lasted and stood the test of time, including cross-country travels and daily NYC commutes — subway strides included! And my feet never feel the stressors — the leather lining and the fabric straps make them super comfortable."" — j–anne Get them from Sorel for $135 (available in sizes 5–12 and in four colors) or from Amazon for $130.85+ (available in sizes 5–12 and in 11 colors). Promising review: "" This was a great shoe for making a wedding reception comfy, and a road trip a little snazzy!!

It didn't leave my side on an 11-day backpack trip through Europe and was used as a scarf, blanket, towel, and wrap all throughout the trip. Fashionable enough to dress up a basic travel day outfit, warm enough to keep away a chill on a cooler night, and light enough to pack away small into a bag or tie around a purse strap.

Popilush is a small business Promising review : ""I absolutely love this Popilush shapewear jumpsuit! It’s the perfect combination of style and functionality.

The square neckline adds a chic touch, making it easy to dress up or down depending on the occasion. The material is soft, breathable, and has just the right amount of stretch, hugging all the right places without feeling too tight. It smooths out my figure beautifully and boosts my confidence every time I wear it . Plus, the shorts stay in place, which is a huge bonus. It works as both a standalone outfit or a base layer under dresses and oversized shirts. I’ve worn it for casual outings and even dressed it up with accessories for a night out—it’s so versatile!

I bought eight more in different colors, and they all are the same quality! I love them so much that over a year later I bought two more black pairs!! I recommend these leggings to everyone.

Here's what BuzzFeed shopping editor Kayla Boyd (pictured above on the left!) has to say: ""Where do I even begin with these leggings?? I love this outfit so much (that's me and my bright green car pictured above) that I went back and bought it in a second color. And am I contemplating buying a third color? YES. The soft, thick material is so great that I don't have to worry about getting holes in my inner thighs after just a couple of wears. They are *very* high-waisted, so I don't have to constantly pull them up (which happens a lot when you have a curvier shape). They're also long enough that they bunch a bit at the ankle, which I personally prefer over that awkward legging length that leaves me with naked ankles. They form to the body perfectly without feeling tight or uncomfy. And let me tell you, I've never gotten so many compliments on such a simple outfit before! It's the kind of good quality that you can just tell by looking at it. I may have been waiting nine long years for Rihanna to release another album, but these leggings almost make me want to forgive her.""

You won’t regret it!"" — Abby Get it from Amazon for $28.99+ (available in sizes S–XL and in 24 colors). Promising review : "" This trench coat is well constructed and very high quality. It looks great over formal attire but can also elevate a casual look. It has a slightly loose fit, as expected with this style, but can be cinched with the belt. It’s lightweight, making it ideal for spring or fall. Just enough to cut the chill and keep you dry in the rain but not overly warm. This is my second LF trench; the first had a plaid flannel lining, which — while very soft and pretty — always made me sweat. This one is perfect!!"" — Ash Get it from Amazon for $76.49+ (available in three colors and sizes XS–3X). Promising review : ""Bought these for both my daughter and me, and they look great on both of us!!! They’re extremely comfortable, and they stretch just enough. The quality is exactly what you expect from Levi’s. We purchased three pairs in total and plan on purchasing more in other colors."" — Lulu herrera Get them from Amazon for $40+ (available in sizes 24–32 Standard and 35–39 Plus and in 14 washes). These boots generally fit true to size, but if you plan on wearing thicker socks or if you're between sizes, it's recommended to size up. Thesus is a mission-driven, Ontario, Canada-based small biz creating outdoor footwear that's easy on the planet, the eyes, and your feet! Their materials are 90% sustainable and traceable — and they're working toward 100%. This brand is all about the details, taking years to develop each collection, and traveling the globe to seek out the best materials for the health of both people and the planet. Promising review: ""I took these hiking in the Rockies and they held up very well. The thicker sole also helped cushion my feet from rocky terrain. They look good too!"" — Alice Get it from Thesus for $150 (originally $198; available in EU sizes 36–46 and 14 colors). Promising review: ""I was a bit skeptical about buying a bodycon dress from an unknown...but am soooo glad I did. The fit is amazing. I can dress it up or down (think New Year's Eve or a beach party). It is really that cool and versatile... This is an all-season, all-event dress... This dress will work for a variety of body shapes. Cons: Sorry, can't think of any."" — Susan R. Get it from Amazon for $49.90+ (available in sizes XXS–5X and in 11 colors). Promising review : ""These are perfect! Exactly how I want my gym shorts to fit right now. This fabric is amazing and the rise is perfect for my pregnant growing belly. Inseam is perfect. Love that there’s no logos. The green is sooooooo luxurious. Love it ."" — Nick Get them from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in sizes XS–XL, in three lengths and 44 colors). I already had these pants in driftwood, black, and martini olive — and I just picked up two more colors for an upcoming trip — because I can't get enough. They're extremely comfy, wash beautifully, and deliver a low-fuss look that's still super pulled together. I agree with the majority of reviewers who say they run large, so size down if you're between sizes! Promising review : ""I loved these linen pants so much I ordered them in two colors. My go-to summer pants; they're great high-quality linen and so comfortable. Easy to dress down at the beach or wear with a tailored top or sweater out to dinner. Already thinking of how I'll style them for fall! A must-buy. Runs slightly large, so size down!"" — Ashley C. Get them from Quince for $39.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and in 11 colors/designs). Promising review: ""Love this dress so much. It’s like wearing a satin nightgown but out in public. I pair a tank top over it and sneakers for a casual look. The slits are sexy without being overtly sexy, and the material just hugs my curves with enough room to still move about."" — Lewis Fam Get it from Amazon for $26.42+ (available in sizes XXS–5X and 21 colors). I have these in all black (as pictured above) and I am OBSESSED with them. They are my go-to travel/all-day walking shoes. They have gone around the world with me and walked 20,000-step days in NYC without so much as a hint of a hint of a blister. They're super easy to get on and off, v cushy, and are impossible to stain. I had my last pair for two years, and they didn't even scuff at all — I had just completely worn off the soles, so it was time to replace them. Promising review : ""These sandals are a game-changer. One of my friends got a pair and I thought they were the cutest shoes ever, I did a double-take when she told me they were Crocs. Really? That ugly clog-making company? Well, call me a Crocs convert because I want a pair in every color. I’ll die in these shoes because I’m never going to take them off. It feels like you’re walking on clouds; they’re so comfortable and supportive. The gradual platform looks edgy but is super easy to walk in — I can still run after my toddler all day. These elevated sandals have changed my life. They go with everything — jeans, shorts, dresses. Buy the shoes, guys."" — OS Get them from Amazon for $40.99+ (available in sizes 4–11 and in 16 colors/patterns). Promising review : ""This thing fits like a dream! I am a pretty 'chesty' person so dresses can sometimes be hit or miss. But this is perfect. I did size down, and it fit me perfectly. 10/10. I’m buying more color,s too ."" — Ashley Patterson Get it from Amazon for $25.99+ (available in sizes S–XL and in 18 colors). I bought these in cream and black first and loved them so much that I picked up another pack with white and brown. They're surprisingly thick, do not wrinkle, are bra-friendly, affordable, and look much more expensive than they are. Promising review : ""True to size tops that can be dressed up or more casual. Sculpts the body and thick quality fabric that washes well and looks expensive . The asymmetrical design is great. Love!"" — Nirvana Get a pack of two from Amazon for $27.99 (available in women's sizes S–XL and in 18 color combinations). I know Birkenstocks are expensive, but they really do last forever (mine average three years with near CONSTANT wear), and once they're broken in, they're so dang comfortable. I've worn them everywhere — including up and down the hills of Positano, at the beach in Jamaica, through old towns in Montenegro, etc. etc. — and they haven't done me wrong. Living in NYC, they're also what I wear 90% of the time come spring and summer, so they've got miles and miles on them. Get them from Birkenstock for $115 (available in women's 4/4.5–12/12.5 standard and wide). Promising reviews : ""From the buttery smooth feel to the color and the fashionable fit, I love this top! It’s a great alternative to a casual tank top to dress up any look!"" — Robin Cowan ""Adorable top! Material isn’t see through at all — that’s what I was worried about. So soft and comfortable. Wore it almost everyday on my cruise!!"" — Abby Get it from Amazon for $13.99 (originally $23.99; available in sizes XS–XL and in 19 colors). Here's what BF shopping editor Danielle Healy has to say: ""Y'all...I bought this bra because I desperately needed something that wouldn't show through thin, white T-shirts and...this is it! Not gonna lie — it's not a sexy pick, but she is comfy as they come with waaayyyy more support than most wireless styles."" Promising reviews: ""I adore these bras . It is a very comfortable fit, super lightweight, and breathable fabric. The perfect bra for me!"" — sarah lee ""I am a victim of bra back bulge and I've tried all the expensive bras from brand names. They claim that they have 'smoothing back' technology but we all know overtime that this stretches out and the bulge comes back. Well, one day I was looking for some clothes online and the Warner bra came up as a suggestion. I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did! This is the MOST comfortable, lightweight, non-bulging bra that i've ever worn. I could literally wear it all day everyday. I wore it traveling the other weekend and it was beyond perfect for a day full of airport delays. Ladies — please buy this bra! You won't regret it!! (I've already bought a few more since!)"" — Meredith B. Get it from Amazon for $20.99+ (available in sizes XS–3XL and 14 colors). BF shopping contributor Rachel Dunkel (pictured above) says: ""I've started to take sun protection super seriously, so a long-sleeve UPF 50+ option is a must. And even as the sweatiest person alive who refuses to pack deodorant when backpacking (extra weight? No thanks), it keeps me dry no matter how many miles I trek."" Promising review: ""I love these. They fit great and are lightweight. I wear them on hot summer days and never feel like I'm sweating. I have several colors and can't wait to collect more."" — Kc H. Get it from Black Diamond for $109+ (available in sizes XXS–XXL and five colors). Promising review : ""These are literally the best leggings/joggers I have ever owned, and I plan to eventually buy every single color. I originally saw these on TikTok and heard they were like the Lululemon ones but cheaper. I've never owned Lululemon leggings, but if they feel anything like these, then I have clearly been missing out. These are soft and absolutely perfect. I love the pockets and jogger style and that they fit like leggings and can be worn to the gym or dressed up with a cute outfit. I need to buy every color of these before they're gone!"" — Courtney Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 22 colors). Macarena Collection is a Buena Park, California–based small biz with all sorts of Mexican-made leather sandals, embroidered Huipil shirts, and home goods. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly has a very similar pair from the same small biz, and here's what she has to say: ""I swear, these are the comfiest shoes I've ever worn straight out of the box. On my first day of wearing them, I walked about 40 city blocks with no pain, blistering, or rubbing. Zilch ! I basically live in them now, and it turns out they match basically everything I wear. I most recently wore them on a day trip to Malacca, Malaysia. I walked all over Jonker Street in search of rice balls and baba cendol and up a grueling hill to see the ruins of St. Paul's Church. Despite it feeling about 1000% humidity, these sandals kept my feet cool and comfy for hours and hours...like they always do!"" Promising review : ""I am loving these shoes! They are high quality, super comfortable, and go with anything. I bought them in both black and brown and have been wearing them daily!!!! I would recommend them to anyone. I read the reviews before I bought them and bought a half-size smaller than I normally wear. They fit perfectly."" — Sarah Niegocki Get them from Macarena Collection on Etsy for $48.74 (originally $64.99; available in sizes 5–10). Promising reviews: ""I bought this jacket in January of 2020. I hardly ever write reviews but clearly, this jacket means enough to me to take the time years later to write its praises. It has been to hell and back with me and all my girlfriends. ALL of us wear it consistently and funny thing is we're all different sizes . I bought the large, in light blue with no fraying except for the bottom back. It's the PERFECT denim shade. One girlfriend is super petite and it's plenty oversized on her and looks great. I am petite with much broader shoulders and it fits me perfectly with an oversized look. My other girlfriend is plus size and it fits her like a regular jean jacket. It's so dang durable and the more you wash it (I've washed it over 100 times) the more relaxed the denim gets. I just love the way it looks with everything, especially when I wear it with the same color denim jeans. I freaking love this thing and I have like, 10 other jean jackets — this one FAR EXCEEDS any others. BUY IT NOW!"" — Heather ""Soft and oh so cute! Very versatile. I purchased the size large and am a size large in tops. It was perfectly oversized and didn’t feel like I was being swallowed by it or like it was too tight on my shoulders ."" — jb Get it from Amazon for $30.99+ (available in sizes S–XXL and in five colors/washes/styles). You know that TikTok sound ""If I like it…I'll just grab it in a different color""? These shoes are my kryptonite. I have them in four different colors and wear them with EVERYTHING, whether I'm on vacation or at home. They go with skirts and dresses just as well as with jeans, and they've never given me a blister!!! According to the health app on my iPhone, my most recent trip included 57 miles of walking, and my feet were in tip-top shape despite walking all day, every day, through four different countries. Pro tip: If you're a women's size 8 or smaller, you can get them in big kid's sizes (I'm an 8 women's, so I get a 6 in kids), and they're like half the price!! Promising review : ""They are soooo comfortable and soft on the inside. I wish I’d bought them sooner. They were comfortable from the moment I put them on… didn’t even have to break them in.” — Sarahsmile Get them from Amazon for $47.25+ (available in sizes 5–11 and in five colors). BTW, Pond Los Angeles is a woman- and Asian American-owned brand based in sunny California. Promising review: ""I fly a lot and am constantly trying to find a hoodie with a big hood to cover my eyes so I can catch up on some beauty sleep on the plane. I saw this product on Instagram and knew it would be a game-changer. I was able to use it recently for the first time on an early morning flight and let me tell you; it is EVERYTHING I was looking for and more. It’s comfy, cozy, and oversized, and the eye covers make you feel like you’re in a whole other world and not packed like a sardine on a plane. My over-ear headphones fit perfectly under it, and I got the best sleep I’ve had on a plane — EVER! Like other reviews have said, it is big, so size down if you want something a little more snug. It’s a little big, but I love my stuff oversized, so I am fine. I have been wearing it every day at home and can’t wait to get the black and blush one!"" — Heather G. Get it from Pond Los Angeles for $105 (originally $145; available in women's sizes XS–XXL and in four colors).

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/racheldunkel/splurge-worthy-camping-products-from-backcountry,travel,,27 Splurge-Worthy Camping Products From Backcountry You'll Want To Bring On Every Trip,13,2023,6,74,"We hope you love our recommendations! Some may have been sent as samples, but all were independently selected by our editors. Just FYI, BuzzFeed and its publishing partners may collect a share of sales and/or other compensation from the links on this page. Beautiful camp furnishings, high-tech accessories, and ultralight goodies for campers of all levels. BuzzFeed Contributor A good rule of thumb is that a tent can hold the number of folks it's rated for (four, in this case) squished like sardines *or* one less person with room for everyone's gear. The more the merrier, IMO, especially with a nice vestibule like this tent has! And since it's rated for three seasons, it'll be perfect for any spring, summer, and fall trips. Just don't take it out in the dead of winter. Mmmm, maybe that'll be a good excuse to get a cabin for the weekend. Promising review: ""I have been camping at Katmai every summer since 2017 (with the exception of Covid 2021). I have camped in June, August, and September. Each month brings totally different weather conditions, from violent winds with heavy rain to spring-like days for a walk in the park. This tent has withstood all conditions without fail. I am on my second tent only because the airline lost all my baggage in 2022. This is a great tent."" — Edward S Price: $398.95 (available in two colors) I have a *slightly* different one-person backpacking tent from Nemo and absolutely adore it! They've perfectly hit that ""all the special features you need and none that you don't"" mark that is essential for lightweight gear. Price: $449.95 Price: $99.95 (available in sizes XS–XL and two colors) To use the Garmin on your trip, the device requires a monthly service fee of $14.95+ (or $11.95+ if you opt for an annual contract). But don't worry, if you're just planning on one trip, the monthly plan only requires a 30-day commitment, so you can bail after your hike and reactivate the next time you go on an adventure. Price: $299.99 (originally $399.99, available in two colors) Promising review: ""I bought these to throw in a backpack for hikes in Southern Utah as we scout the cliffs. They are the perfect size and offer a clear picture and ideal magnification power for my purposes. They are sturdy and easy to use for me and the kids. I definitely recommend these for a solid set of hiking binoculars."" — Landon L Price: $94.95 (available in five colors) I've had my OG Rumpl blanket since 2019 and literally could not love it more. Six years in and it still lives in the trunk of my car, ready for impromptu trips, picnics, and park hangs! It's a splurge-worthy piece of gear I've recommended to basically everyone in my life with my whole chest and will for years to come. Price: $99 (available in two colors) Promising review: "" I’ve had my Yakima blanket for at least 15 years, maybe more. It goes on all my adventures. From sleeping in my hammock in warmer months wrapped like a burrito, to sleeping in the back of my '97 4Runner. Keeping me toasty, always. When my kids came of age, they received a Pendleton blanket as well, with the understanding that this blanket is to be used. Whether picnics, camping out in the mountains, concerts, or wherever their adventures take them. My daughter just received hers this Christmas at 17 years old. She was tickled to death and snuggled up in it right away. Mine is a little threadbare around the edges, but still going strong."" — FlyFishNut Price: $199+ (available in two sizes and six colors) The cooler features a ""three-stage dynamic battery protection"" that miraculously means it stays cool without draining your car battery (that was also my first worry). It can fit up to 67 cans (!!!!) and also includes dividers so you can keep everything contained and tidy. Promising review: ""I have had a number of ice coolers over the years. The CFX3 45L has an amazing amount of room, considering no space has to be given up for ice. The cooler does a great job of keeping everything cool. I have paired it with a PLB40 battery, and it keeps the fridge running for just short of two days (I have been averaging about 2–3% of battery capacity/hour when not in direct sunlight). Unlike ice coolers, nothing gets soggy, and no water to drain or ice to buy. I was so impressed with the performance of the CFX3 45L, I added the CFX3 25L for those shorter day trips. Highly recommend if you want to get away from the traditional ice cooler."" — Tami M Price: $850 The burners feature wind screens to keep the party going even if it's a blustery night, and they run on standard 16-ounce propane fuel tanks. The burners also have simmer control — fancy! — so you can really dial in your signature dishes. Price: $399.99 The reservoir you put dirty water in holds 3 liters of water, and it filters at a rate of 2 liters per minute. Whoa, that's faster than I thought! Maybe it's time I finally try one! Backpackers love this system, but they'd also be great for car camping trips where you have access to nice, running mountain water. Sure, you could pack your own, but drinking the water you find in the backcountry really is a special experience, especially when you have confidence it's safe to drink after treatment. Promising review: ""Only used once in 50 degrees. Stream was clean, running fast, and filled the bladder in 7 seconds. Flow rate was perfect for my needs. Perfect holding points especially at intake side for submerging. First, BeFree, so will see how long it lasts with a good flow rate. I'll likely carry an extra filter if out solo. Weight is perfect for the benefit. Last thing I want to do is squeeze a bag for my water after a long hike and setting up camp. Now I know why I see a lot of gravity filters are hanging. The holding strap was a bit much for my needs unless someone uses it as a shoulder-carrying strap. I changed that up."" — Dilf Price: $79.95 There's really nothing like going to bed in a down bag, and their warm yet breathable feel is really unmatched and worth the splurge. Down bags are also usually much lighter and easier to pack down than synthetic ones, making them more versatile and easy to throw in a backpacking pack. This bag also comes with a compression bag to get it super tiny for transport. Price: $359.95 for men's sizes or women's sizes (each available in long and regular lengths) Price: $449.95 This pad has an R-value of 7.2, which just means it's A-OK to take out on your winter camping trips, as well as your trips during the rest of the year! When you unroll a ""self-inflating"" pad, it'll puff up, doing most of the air intake for you. You'll just need to pump it up a little bit more to get it to your desired firmness, hence: the integrated pump! Price: $500+ (available in two lengths) The chair weighs 17.6 ounces. Promising review: ""I am so glad I bought this chair and absolutely loved having it on my four-day, three-night backpacking trip. I used it around camp and took it on my day hikes. It's easy to set up, packs easily into its own carrying case, and is super light. I won't backpack or day hike without it now!"" — Shannon Price: $139.95 (available in three colors) Ummm, I just don't think I've ever seen a cooler cuter than this! It comes in such fun colors, and those back wheels really will help you get it around. No more lugging with flimsy handles! Price: $399.95 (available in three colors) This lantern can run for five hours on its highest setting and a whopping 200 hours on its lowest. Whoa! It's rechargeable with an included USB and is water resistant, so you don't have to worry too much about sudden showers or packing it up just so. Speaking of packing, it also features a locking setting so it doesn't accidentally turn on in your bag and drain its battery before the trip even begins! Price: $79.95 And here are the Atlas Straps you'll need to hang your new hammock quickly and easily! Price: $74.95 (available in 12 colors) The table is expandable, and the center can be opened to put a stove in between the two sides, creating a cool cooking and prep space. The bamboo top can also double as a cutting board, and aluminum construction perfectly balances strength and weight. It folds down to fit in an included carrying case with a handle. Price: $419.95 Promising review: ""I've had 3–4 pairs of these and I typically blow the toes out of all my socks. Not these. I have a pair that are almost 8 years old and show no sign of falling apart anytime soon."" — Mdksde Price: $27.95 for men's sizes M–XL (available in six colors) or women's sizes S–L (available in three colors) Promising review: ""This is the camping pad that I have been waiting for. No pumping, no worrying about punctures. Just a comfortable night's sleep. Took two seconds to unroll and you're ready for bed."" — Brock H Price: $329 The pad has an R-value of 4.5, so it's a little on the low end for a winter trip, but depending on the exact temperature, it could work. TL;DR, do a little research before taking this out in December. But for spring, summer, and fall trips, you're good to go! The regular size weighs in at just a hair over a pound, so if you're at the backpacking stage where you're counting ounces, I think you'll be really happy with this upgrade! Price: $189+ (available in three sizes) You don't *have* to have a Sea to Summit pad to enjoy this pillow — anyone can use it! You just won't get to use the locking feature. Price: $64.95+ (available in two sizes) Price: $99.95 Price: $27.95 (available in nine colors) An older model of the Ariel was my first backpacking pack, and I still have BIG love for it! Absolutely the most comfortable bag I've ever owned, and I found 65 liters to be a good volume to start out with, especially if you enjoy bringing a luxury item or two, are planning on going out during colder weather (requiring bulkier gear), are carrying gear for a friend, kid, or pet, or just have a kit that skews larger. If you're conscious of your pack's weight, there are lots of removable components, including the ""brain"" at the top of the pack. But rest assured, weight carries really well in this bag thanks to mercifully padded hip straps. Price: $207+ for the Ariel (originally $319.95, available in sizes XS–L) and $339.95 for the Atmos (available in sizes S–XL and three colors) This pack is at the top of my ultralight wish list! It weighs just two pounds (the black version is an ounce heavier, funny enough) and just seems super functional. The folks that I've met who have tested it love it, yes, for backpacking, but also for using as a travel bag in general. Hey! A great bag is a great bag. Promising review: ""High quality and well-made. This is the backpack if you need something that is simple, ultralight, and waterproof. It is a roll-top bag so not as convenient as one with a zipper opening which allows full access to the contents without pulling everything out but is is like half the weight. The seams of the pack are the only areas where water could penetrate. The 55-liter provides additional flexibility to expand when you have a larger load out, but can be rolled down to 40 liters if you don't need the extra space."" — Melissa M Price: $379+ (available in three sizes and two colors) Price: $144.99 Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:49:46.535389+00:00

As any parent knows, packing for yourself and your children can be overwhelming (especially for a trip longer than a few days ). I have found this list to be a lifesaver, and I also give it as a gift for other traveling families. It is easy to plan, organize, and list out items that are easily forgotten.

Overall, wonderful purchase and has likely saved me many forgotten items!"" — I-really-bought-this Get it from Amazon for $7 (available in three styles, including one specifically for road trips).

Promising review : ""I travel frequently for work and keep this in my suitcase. Works great; I no longer carry a lint roller."" — Liza Przekop Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in four colors and also in packs of two or four). You can also get a single AirTag for $24.99 . Promising review: ""While on a delayed flight from Newark to Dublin, I could see one of my bags was not on the plane. This was great information because when we arrived in Dublin, I was able to be the first one in line to file a missing bag claim."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $74.99 . I'm obsessed with my Philips Sonicare electric toothbrush (and so is my dentist!), but it's just way too bulky to stuff in my already over-stuffed carry-on when I'm traveling. I decided to try this out on a recent trip and was super impressed with how well it works. I love that it has a two-minute timer built in (with reminders to switch quadrants every 30 seconds), and it gives a nice, gentle vibration. For under $20, this is a great alternative to lugging around a bulky rechargeable toothbrush and way better than most flimsy travel toothbrushes. Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in nine colors). Promising review: ""Hate dragging out the old hotel iron and board, so I just spray my wrinkled clothes with this, and voila! Takes the wrinkles out, and off I go — no wrestling while putting the iron and board away. I even have a small travel iron or use my hair styling irons if I want a better finish, but this usually does the job nicely."" — Audie Get it from Amazon for $6.05 . Promising review: ""Just what I needed. This worked perfectly on a recent business trip. Felt refreshing and left my skin feeling soft."" — Glenda E Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $6.88 . Promising review: ""These were cute and easy to use. I love my fragrances but I refuse to travel with them because they are expensive. These are very handy and you can put them in your purse on a plane!"" — SG Get a four-pack from Amazon for $7.99 (available in three color combinations and also in packs of five). Promising review: ""This is a great carry-on bag! It has numerous pockets and storage areas to keep everything organized. I've taken it on three trips to Europe this year, as well as a few domestic trips, and it fits well under most airline seats (unless the seat has a footrest). In those cases, it's easy to fit it in the overhead compartment. On a couple of occasions when airlines requested that carry-on bags be checked at the gate, this bag was OK for me to carry onboard since it's not too large (yet it holds a lot). In an emergency, I was able to fit three days of clothes, sweaters, a jacket, toiletries, shoes, and electronics in this bag because it's so easy to organize it in numerous compartments. It wheels great, too. I've traveled a lot over the years, and this is the best carry-on bag I've found. I bought two of them!"" — DM7233 Get it from Amazon for $55.99 (available in nine colors). Promising review: ""This garment bag is an exceptional value for the money. Well-built, top-quality materials, including 'beefy' zippers, should hold up well for airline travel. Minimal wrinkles, if any, in garments, and a cavernous bag for storing shoes and other items for a trip. Added bonus: it fits easily in the plane overhead storage and is similar in size to a standard roller bag . I highly recommend this product."" — Kindle Customer Beauty Goodies is a small business that specializes in chic storage and travel accessories. Get it from Amazon for $40.99+ (available in three colors). These are also perfect for cleaning your teeth before popping Invisalign trays back in! Promising review: ""You don't generate a lot of spit while using these, like you would with toothpaste, so you don't need a sink. It's just spit... there's nothing wrong with swallowing it. The little ball in the middle has a similar effect to mouthwash, but it doesn't burst or expel liquid. It just wears down as you brush. I bought these for the purpose of cleaning my teeth at work. I often eat at my desk, and the idea of brushing my teeth in the work (or any public) restroom was gross to me. I can brush at my desk and put my Invisalign trays back in. "" — KC Get four packs of 24 toothbrushes from Amazon for $23.84. Promising review: ""This is my second purchase! The first was a gift to my bf, and I liked it, so I bought one for myself. Slim and lightweight, it goes perfectly in a purse or pocket. I like that I can charge three things at the same time and that one of the outlets is a C-type."" — CaptGellyfish Get it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""Just received these cute little boxes and am in love with them. Very thick and sturdy plastic, but easy enough to open. These will work perfectly for filling solid perfumes and giving out as stocking stuffer gifts, as I don't have to worry about it being a snug fit/lid falling off. I imagine these would also be great for pretend food for kids' playsets or for a kid's trinket box. Overall, I love them, love their feel, love the colors, and am very happy ."" — Mary Get a set of six from Amazon for $6.99 . Promising review: ""You can totally fit three pairs of shoes in this! (Size 6.5 women's shoe, fits heels, wedges, and sandals.) I bought two and will absolutely be buying more for my husband. 10/10 would recommend!

Get it from Hustle and Sew on Etsy for $8 (available in 14 scrunchie colors and three zipper colors). The set comes with four bottles, four jars, two spray bottles, two scoopers (to help transfer creams), one funnel (to help transfer liquids), one cleaning brush, a page of labels, and a bag that everything fits in. Promising review: ""I’ve purchased a lot of different travel sets for my toiletries over the years. Inevitably, they are hard to fill and tend to leak. This set was magic! The wide mouth made it easy to fill from a larger bottle, and the little scoops made transferring creams to the jar containers very easy and with much less mess. The only con (hardly worth mentioning) is that once you squeeze the bottle, it takes a few minutes to expand with air again, so the sides are a bit sunken. I solved that by unscrewing the top just a bit for a quick release of the vacuum pressure. I had no leaks, and plenty of containers for every toiletry."" — MDC Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in eight colors). Promising review: ""It’s a little hard to fill, but if you have a small funnel already, it makes it a lot easier. They’re super easy to use and really convenient for packing. I use it for the gym, travel, and I also travel for work often, and it comes in handy there."" — Kelsey Jacobi Get a set of two from Amazon for $6.99 (available in three colors). Promising review: "" This is perfect for traveling. I got the smaller size because it looked like it held a good amount, and it does! I wear a decent amount of jewelry every day and like to have different pieces and it held everything I wanted to pack. It is also very cute and doesn't take up much space at all. Love it."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in two sizes and 10 colors and patterns). Promising review: ""I LOVE this backpack! The color is a perfect light cream, way cuter than other travel backpacks. I spent a week in Spain on my own, and this backpack truly fit everything I needed when I couldn’t bring my suitcase. The padding and support on the back and the straps made it so comfortable to carry, despite how full it was. The way the backpack is structured distributes the weight evenly and does not cause strain at all. The many compartments make it so easy to keep things organized and allow you to fit more things just when you think it’s full. I kept my clothes rolled up in the main compartment, my toiletries in the waterproof front compartment, and my laptop and Kindle in the back. The bottom compartment was perfect for all my cables."" — Olivia Get it from Amazon for $22.79+ (available in four sizes and 40 styles). Promising review: ""This bag is very well made and water resistant. The bag has plenty of room for a laptop, papers, folders, and cords.

I like travel-sized brushes because the teeth tend to be spaced further apart and work better for my curls. This brush is waterproof, so it works great in the shower. Also good for kids with lots of tangles."" — DG ""My son has 4c hair and brushes I’ve tried before break his curls and would take forever to detangle his hair!

Each stack also includes a mirror lid, a base, and a mini brush. Promising review: ""I absolutely love how compact this product is.

I thought the hanger would break, but it held up fine! Hotels never supply enough hangers, so I will be bringing these along when I travel."" — debi Get a pack of 12 from Amazon for $9.99 . Each set comes with a small, medium, large, and extra-large cube, a shoe bag, and a laundry bag. Reviewers also mention using these to organize drawers when they're not traveling. Promising review: ""I have been on the fence about buying packing cubes for two years! I wasn’t sure if they would really make a difference in my packing or not. However, I am so glad I decided to get some! I have looked at many brands, but I am happy I decided on this one! These are made from a great material and are super cute! This is one of the few brands that include both a shoe bag and a dirty linen bag!... I was actually able to close my luggage with ease for the first time. These keep your clothes clean and organized. It makes packing and unpacking a breeze. "" — Cindy U. Get a set of eight from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in 11 colors). Promising review: ""I was skeptical about a bar shampoo, but wanted something that would last and I could take on my frequent travels... This was the solution I was after, and I plan to use it even back home. A little goes a long way and leaves my hair feeling bouncy and refreshed. It also has a nice, clean scent that isn't overpowering. Would purchase again."" — Jennifer G. Get it from Amazon for $13.50+ (available in 11 options and various packs). BuzzFeed Shopping editor Elizabeth (that's her above) has traveled with this in her carry-on and loves it: "" Here, I used hotel shampoo (it was pretty fancy, NGL), this shampoo bar, and my roommate's Moroccan Oil curl cream . The bar is basically foolproof. You rub it directly on your wet hair after rinsing out your shampoo. I normally wash my naturally curly hair once or twice a week, but on this trip, I was taking daily dips in the sea, so I washed my hair 5x over a week. Because of this, I let the conditioner sit for a few minutes, though you probably don't need to do that if you're washing your hair your usual amount on your trip. Each bar is supposed to last 200 washes, and it might do a little less for me, but I know this'll be good for many future trips!"" Promising review : This is incredible! It leaves my hair feeling soft, hydrated, and healthier with every use. I was skeptical about switching from a traditional liquid conditioner, but this bar exceeded my expectations. It’s compact, eco-friendly, and lasts longer than I expected."" — Niki Saigeon Get it from Amazon for $13.99 . Check out a TikTok of the dry shampoo in action.

I am so very happy!"" — Katie_0_Baker Get it from Amazon for $17 (available in brown, dark brown, blonde, and in multipacks and bundles). Promising review: ""Love, love, love these!!! I have a lot of medications that I have to travel with, and some of them are very expensive or very important, and I get so worried I will lose some.

BuzzFeed,https://www.buzzfeed.com/jillianwilson/alcohol-guidelines-nutritionist-experts-sc,travel,,"Nutritionists Are Sharing Alcohol “Rules” You Should Really Be Following, Including Women Having No More Than One Drink Per Day",20,1468,3,20,"It might be time to reassess your relationship with alcohol. HuffPost Writer As the sobriety awareness of Dry January comes to a close, you may feel a pull to go back to your old drinking habits. But it could be worth thinking about your use of alcohol and making a change that lasts beyond January. (And, no, this does not have to mean cutting it out altogether.) Terms like “ mindful drinking ” and “ sober curious ” are showing up in the news and on social media, indicating that folks are taking these research findings seriously. What mindful drinking means for one person might not be the same as for another, but in essence it’s bringing awareness to your alcohol consumption and choosing to drink when you actually want to, not just as a reflex while watching the game or as a crutch to deal with stress. Although some people who follow this lifestyle do still drink, others don’t, making the definition fluid and customizable to what’s right for you. In the end, your decision to drink or not to drink is up to you. But for those who decide to imbibe, nutritionists say there are some things to keep in mind. Below, they share the alcohol guidelines you should follow if you do choose to drink. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines define moderate drinking as no more than one drink for women and two drinks for men each day, said Christine Byrne , a registered dietitian and the owner of Ruby Oak Nutrition in Raleigh, North Carolina. “I think that is a pretty good guideline,” she added. “Those specific guidelines also point out that it doesn’t mean seven drinks in a week for women, it means one drink a day — so not drinking for five days and then drinking six drinks on the sixth day is not the same thing.” “Alcohol is a lot for your body to process,” which is why you can’t just bank all of those drinks for day six, Byrne said. “Overloading [your body] with alcohol on one day and not drinking for seven days or more can be more harmful than just drinking one drink for women or two drinks for men on a single day ... our bodies are able to process that amount of alcohol.” Not be a buzzkill, but one alcoholic drink does not mean a Long Island iced tea (a cocktail that combines gin, vodka, rum, tequila and triple sec). Instead, the CDC says one drink is equivalent to a 12-ounce beer that is 5% alcohol by volume (ABV), 5 ounces of wine that’s 12% ABV, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor or 8 ounces of malt liquor that is 7% ABV. But know that alcohol is not beneficial to your health. ″[It’s] really important to know that recently, I think as of last year, the World Health Organization actually came out and said that no amount of alcohol is safe ,” said Sumner Brooks , a registered dietitian and author of “ How to Raise an Intuitive Eater .” “We know that alcohol is associated with cancer, it’s a Group 1 carcinogen, which puts it in the same group level as tobacco,” Brooks said. Beyond being a carcinogen, alcohol is a toxin, according to Byrne, who added that “our body prioritizes metabolizing the alcohol because it’s a toxin, so it wants to get rid of it.” The WHO guidelines say that even one drink per day for women and two per day for men is still associated with these health risks, Brooks noted. So for people who do choose to drink, “it’s just important [to know] that we’ve moved past the point of that general consensus that drinking offers health benefits,” she added. Suffice to say that just because the guidelines say you can have a certain amount of alcohol each day doesn’t mean you should. It’s not an official guideline, but the notion of following up an alcoholic drink with a glass of water is a good practice to follow, Byrne said. “Not only does it hydrate you, it also slows you down, and that can be helpful,” she added. Alcohol is a diuretic, which means it makes you pee more often and can dehydrate you. If you decide to drink more than what the CDC guidelines consider “moderate drinking,” following each drink with water is helpful, noted Byrne. You probably have at least one memory (albeit, a fuzzy one) of drinking on an empty stomach. For more reasons than one, Byrne said, drinking on an empty stomach is not a good idea. “I do not recommend drinking on an empty stomach. The alcohol can hit you faster that way, and that can be a problem,” she said. Specifically, according to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism , your body absorbs alcohol faster when you don’t have food in your stomach. “Drinking while eating can help you not get so drunk, which is a good thing,” Byrne said. “It also could help you drink less because you’re not just drinking, you’re also eating — there’s something else to do. And drinking less is a good thing.” So if you end up at a happy hour with friends, order a few bites to eat, too. According to Brooks, while alcohol does provide your body with calories, it does not provide it with necessary nutrition, like protein, fiber or fat. “People tend to equate dietary quality with calories, which is really harmful, especially when it comes to alcohol. Because if they’re just thinking about how many calories they’re taking in, then they will replace food calories with alcohol calories and think that’s enough or that’s a healthy replacement,” Brooks said. “But really, nutrition is about getting what we need: proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins and minerals and water, and when we’re cutting those things out to maintain calorie balance, then there’s a nutrition risk,” she said. Your body isn’t getting the nutrients it needs if you’re replacing a meal with a filling beer. Byrne said it’s important to know the official definition of binge drinking. The CDC says having five drinks or more on an occasion for men and four drinks or more for women is considered binge drinking. “I think it’s less than a lot of people think,” Byrne noted. Think about it: If you’ve ever been to a wedding where there’s cocktail hour, dinner, dancing and often an after-party, you know how easy it is to have four or five drinks during the celebration. “What you do with alcohol is completely up to you, and just because you drink more than what’s considered binge drinking on a single occasion doesn’t necessarily mean you have an alcohol addiction or an alcohol problem,” Byrne said. “I want to make that clear, too, but technically speaking, that is the definition of binge drinking.” For those who do choose to drink, Brooks said it’s important to pay attention to three things: “If you are saying, ‘Well, I just need this drink because I just need to relax’ ... that alcohol itself isn’t actually what helps you relax. [What can give you that effect can] be the sitting, taking a break from what you’re doing or going to happy hour and talking to people, connecting to people, getting a change of scenery,” Brooks explained. You can still relax without a glass of wine. You could take up coloring or take a bath with a seltzer by your side instead of a glass of wine, or you could go out for a walk for an after-work change of scenery, she added. “If somebody believes that having that drink at the end of the day is their way to relax, then just by default they’re not thinking about other ways that they actually could decompress,” Brooks said. Beyond thinking about your intention with alcohol, it’s important to look at any red flags, too. “If you think your drinking might be problematic, ask yourself why you’re doing it,” Byrne said, “and if you’re doing it to avoid certain feelings or numb certain feelings, then that’s something to question and probably a reason to reassess your relationship with alcohol.” In this case, it’s also a good idea to reach out to a therapist who’s trained in substance use treatment who can support you, Byrne added. The Psychology Today website can help you find a local mental health provider. Additionally, Brooks noted that changing your drinking habits is not an easy feat. If you are trying to do this, it’s a good idea to lean on loved ones who have a similar mindset. Need help with substance use disorder or mental health issues?

BuzzFeed Shopping contributor Abby Kass swears by her Kindle as a travel must-have : ""Yes, that is me sitting in a pool in Hawaii holding my Kindle over the water without fear or stress that if it falls in, it will break. Truly living my best life."" Promising review: ""I LOVE reading and being able to access a book anywhere with this thing. It is easy to navigate, very easy to read and adjust the brightness or how warm the light is. It doesn't auto adjust, but I don't need that feature. I've read in bright sunlight to dark rooms, and it's always been so clear. You can adjust the font and use the library to search whatever books you want. Makes packing books for traveling very easy. Battery life lasts me two weeks if I'm reading every day for a few hours ."" — R@L0 Get it from Amazon for $149.99 (available in three colors and with or without lockscreen ads). Promising review: ""Lots of space. I bought this for a business trip so I could carry my laptop and clothes for two nights and not check a bag at the airport. This worked perfectly and looks nice."" — Angie J Get it from Amazon for $22.79+ (available in four sizes and 40 styles). Now you won't even have to pull your suitcase outta the overhead! Promising review : ""I purchased this primarily for a better personal item carrier for flying. I was using a small gym bag but it didn’t keep anything organized. This is perfect with it’s many outside and inside compartments which allows me to get easy access to things I need to access during my flight and separate important items like phone chargers, medication, chewing gum, etc . As you can see, it fit under the seat perfectly with plenty of room for my feet on both Jet Blue and Southwest flights . Flight crew didn’t hassle me about its use as a personal item (although now Southwest won’t let my bring my pillow as an “assistive device” along with my purple bag and a carryon, but that’s a different story). I’m planning on using this in the Fall for a high school reunion where I may want to put some dress clothes for the event in a separate bag for transport. I plan to get a lot of use out of this bag and you will, also. I love the purple color as well."" — Laura D Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I was looking for a lightweight luggage scale to ensure that when returning from vacation, my luggage was not overweight. This works amazing. Super lightweight and extremely accurate."" — Taziree Get it from Amazon for $11.98 (available in six colors). Check out a TikTok of the Airplane Pockets tray table cover in action. Airplane Pockets is a small business that specializes in sanitary, portable travel organization products. My colleague Emma Lord owns and loves this : ""I used this on a roundtrip from NYC to Tokyo, both with connecting flights in Canada, and cannot sing its praises enough. It fit all four of the different tray tables I used it on and was so ridiculously handy for keeping track of all my littler odds and ends like AirPods, the plane's headphones, earplugs, a sleep mask, a book, gum, a scrunchie, and little snacks. The hanging end of it easily tucked into the built-in sleeve of the seat in front of me for takeoff and when other passengers needed to scoot past me in my aisle seat. Usually, I feel like a hot mess and get frustrated rooting around in the grimy sleeve for my stuff, and this was such a refreshing solution! Several flight attendants even asked where I got it to buy one for themselves!"" Promising review: ""Very useful, especially when traveling with kids . Provided easy access and storage to things like a water bottle, hand sanitizer, snacks, wipes, and headphones. I didn't have to access my carry-on."" — JJ Get it from Amazon for $29.99 . Heads up — you can only use this if you're sitting in a seat that has access to a full window! Promising review: ""I used this for the first time on a 737. It was fabulous! It didn't intrude into my sitting space nearly as much as I expected. Because the actual window is recessed from the side wall, this only sticks out from the side wall about an inch. If you're considering this, you likely fly enough to know that seats aren't always aligned with the windows. If your window happens to be right beside your seat or the seat in front of you, this won't be of much use. But because it doesn't jut out as much as I thought, you can use it in more situations than I expected. And when you can use it, it's great! I love not having to have my entire tray table down just to hold a 3-inch cup. My only suggestion would be to add a place to hold trash until the flight attendant picks it up. This is very small, very lightweight, and very useful. I'll be taking it on every flight from here on. "" — JBC Get it from Amazon for $19.99 . Some color options come with dry-erase markers and an eraser included! Promising review : ""Are you a parent who is sick of picking up everything your kid accidentally drops off their lap while on a car ride? If not, lucky you. If you are… this thing is great! We recently went on a beach vacation that involved a 9-hour drive each way with my 4-year-old. Usually, he drops stuff while playing with it. With this, everything stayed on the tray! It also helped him balance his tablet to watch, held his drink and food stuff in place without anything spilling, and gave him a space to draw and play on. Easy to take on and off for potty breaks."" — Dawn Michele Get it from Amazon for $22.95+ (available in 11 colors and a two-pack). Check out a TikTok showing how someone used a similar neck pillow to just take that and a personal item onto a RyanAir flight that was charging for hand luggage. Promising review: ""The Tube Pillow was a savior on my last trip. It held a surprising amount of clothes and doubled as a dirty laundry bag . I used it as an on-the-lap pillow, but it was a tad awkward to maneuver. For extra storage without extra fees, it's worth it!"" — Sharon Get it from Amazon for $61.19 . I adoreee my Quince suitcase. It's such good quality, and incredibly easy to push around, which, believe me, is a super important factor to consider when traveling around. It's spacious, holds a ton of clothes, and the removable laundry bag is such an amazing little addition that really does elevate the whole thing. Plus, I love the color! It's super easy to spot my suitcase on the baggage claim belt, which is perfect for my sleep-deprived self. Promising review : ""This suitcase is a beautiful color, with smooth gliding wheels, and tons of space. It is sturdy but lightweight. All around, this is a good piece of luggage."" — Jennifer J. Get it from Quince for $199 (available in five sizes and six colors). This carry-on is so smooth to wheel around, I was so incredibly happy to use this on my recent trip to NYC for my young daughter. I could easily push around a stroller *and* this carry-on without it causing me any issues. The sunshine yellow color is so pretty and such a pop, I feel so cool walking around with it. Plus, it was able to hold all of my daughter's clothes and effects easily, despite its compact form! Promising review : ""Great carry-on, so thoughtfully designed for little ones to travel more independently, while still maximizing capacity. Fun, bold colors add so much personality to the suitcase, and kids love playing 'airport' both at home and on the go. Excellent quality/durability like the Away original designs, will be a lasting purchase. Highly recommend."" — Jess Get it from Away for $225 (available in five colors). Promising review: ""I travel frequently and travel light. My luggage is usually limited to a backpack that slides under the airline seat. For a two-week European cruise, I added a carry-on rolling suitcase. I've used these packing cubes twice so far, and I am hooked. One cube holds everything (including clothing) I take on a three-night trip. The cube slides into my pack, saving massive amounts of room, and everything is easy to find during travel and at the hotel . Taking out one cube and unzipping is much better than digging through a pack! I will never leave home without these!"" — Gura Get a set of four packing cubes (also comes with a laundry bag) from Amazon for $21.99 (available in 25 colors and two sets). Just pack in your clothes, roll up the bag, and watch as the excess air is squeezed out. BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord says: ""HELLO, I AM OBSESSED WITH THESE. Despite all the rave reviews I was definitely skeptical of space-saving bags that didn't require a vacuum, and even as they were actively squishing my clothes into oblivion I still couldn't quite believe it. I had easily two suitcases worth of clothes I wanted to pack for a three-week trip to London, and I managed to neatly pack the entirety of my wardrobe in one roller carry-on bag. Truly all I had to do was put my clothes in the bag, push them to the bottom, and then sit on it to get the air out before sealing it up. I had tons of extra bags and make a habit of taking them with me in case other people joining me on trips need them to be able to pack souvenirs on the way home. I'm never taking a long trip without these again — these are worth every damn penny. "" Promising review: ""I travel monthly for work, usually gone for 4–5 days. Before these, I would have to check a bag. Dress shirts and pants roll up nicely and stay wrinkle free. It's tempting to want to over-stuff these, but if you're packing golf shirts or cloths with 'slippery' fabric, they slide out of the top of the bag as you get close to the end. The clips take a minute to get used to, but after a couple of times zipping up the bags, it's pretty easy."" — BigSkinny Get a set of eight from Amazon for $15.98 . Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. See what BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord has to say about these : I've been using the regular-sized version of this for over a year now and I LOVE it! I used to use an electric toothbrush, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these — e specially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively. My teeth feel genuinely ~squeaky clean~ after I use this, too. Promising review : ""This toothbrush is a new staple item for my on the go Invisalign bag. When I need to brush my teeth and don't have time to floss before putting my aligners back in , this brush makes sure my teeth and mouth feel clean and removes debris in-between my teeth. The bristles are soft, this toothbrush is sturdy and the different lengths of bristles help remove debris or help floss your teeth on the go . This brush also dries very fast in-between uses as well. "" — V. Brown Get a set of two from Amazon for $9.99. The ""daily routine"" set includes four medium and three small capsules as well as magnetic, interchangeable labels for shampoo, conditioner, body wash, moisturizer, cleanser, a pill icon, and a blank tile. They also offer skincare , bodycare , haircare , and pill case sets as well as extenders that increase the size of the capsule! Cadence is an AAPI woman-owned small business that was founded by Steph Hon with the goal of eliminating single-use travel-sized plastics. The containers are made from recycled ocean-bound plastic. Promising review : ""These containers are perfectly sized for all my travel needs, whether it’s skincare products, vitamins, or even small jewelry pieces. They fit neatly into my carry-on, saving space and keeping everything organized. No more messy toiletry bags or digging around for tiny items — everything has its place with Cadence. The quality of the materials is top-notch. The containers snap together securely, making it easy to keep them organized and prevent any spills. It’s such a clever and practical feature that adds a touch of luxury to the whole experience. Plus, it’s oddly satisfying to hear the little click when they snap into place! ""I’ll be honest — the price did give me pause at first. These containers are definitely an investment, but I can confidently say they’re worth it. The peace of mind they provide, knowing my products are safe and secure during travel, is priceless. Plus, the high-quality build means they’ll last for many trips to come, making them a smart long-term investment."" — Randy G. Get the daily routine set from Amazon for $138 (available in five colors and other sets ). The set comes with four bottles, four jars, two spray bottles, two scoopers (to help transfer creams), one funnel (to help transfer liquids), one cleaning brush, a page of labels, and a bag that everything fits in. Promising review: ""I’ve purchased a lot of different travel sets for my toiletries over the years. Inevitably, they are hard to fill and tend to leak. This set was magic! The wide mouth made it easy to fill from a larger bottle, and the little scoops made transferring creams to the jar containers very easy and with much less mess. The only con (hardly worth mentioning) is that once you squeeze the bottle, it takes a few minutes to expand with air again, so the sides are a bit sunken. I solved that by unscrewing the top just a bit for a quick release of the vacuum pressure. I had no leaks, and plenty of containers for every toiletry."" — MDC Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in seven colors). BuzzFeed Shopping editor Elizabeth Lilly is a big fan of these: ""Each pack comes with three packets. And, because they *are* liquid, they'll easily slide into the side of your toiletries bag. I've packed these on international trips to much success!"" Promising review : ""Taking these out of the country to wash under things is exactly the right size."" — Laura Wilson Get nine packs from Amazon for $6.39 (available in two scents and four pack sizes). Plus, it has a zipper compartment at the bottom for putting all your dirty clothes in so they don't get mixed with clean items (forcing you to end up just washing everything when you get home). Promising review: ""I just love it. I travel a lot. Now I don’t have to hang anything up but my organizer. I can see what I pack and where everything is. Just love it. I can easily fit seven days' worth of outfits and three pairs of shoes in a carry-on suitcase. Just great."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $22.99+ (available in two sizes and 10 colors). Promising review: ""Excellent for travel! Nice to have a go-to individual pouch, especially for the chords. Husband travels for business, and this is a must, so if he's in an airport or hotel, he can locate them easily and they don’t get mixed with others."" — Brent Webb Get it from Amazon for $9.85+ (available in three sizes and 23 colors). Promising review: ""My favorite traveling item! Before, I was sticking jewelry in ziplock bags and in my suitcase, and I’d lose them in there or they’d tangle, and I was limited on what I could bring. I bring this with me every time we go out of town for business."" — Kristy and Jose Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in two sizes and eight colors). This powder shampoo is benzene-free! Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go . You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair, so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" — Teresa Get it from Amazon for $18 (available in 10 shades). Plus, it's lead-, latex-, and BPA-free, dishwasher safe, and can be used for hot or cold drinks. Promising review: ""Bought this water bottle for a trip to Disney World. At home, I always have my 40-ounce water bottle nearby. I was worried about walking around the park and not having quick access to water on those hot park days. We only brought a fanny pack in and didn't have room for something big. This was perfect! It wasn't too overbearing to hold and was super easy to fold up and throw in the bag when not in use. My only regret is I didn't buy two!"" — E. Alarcón Get it from Amazon for $8.29+ (available in three sizes/styles and 12 colors). It also comes with a USB-C charging cable, travel pouch, keychain holder, quick-start guide, and a manual. Twelve South is a small business that has been creating innovative tech accessories since 2009. My colleague Chelsea Stuart owns and loves this: ""I splurged on some AirPod Maxes and for the amount of money I threw down on them, I was determined to get as much use out of them as possible and that included on plane rides. With the AirFly Pro, I can connect my headphones via Bluetooth and use the seat-back screen without having to fiddle with the free wired headphones they hand out that 1.) have horrible sound quality and 2.) don't fit my ears in the slightest (I swear my ear canals are tiny or something??)."" Promising review: ""I was a little reluctant purchasing Airfly after reading the reviews, but I’m so glad I did! It worked perfectly on the plane, and while on my trip, I also used it to listen to music in the car. It acted like a speaker because I had no aux cable. It was great!"" — Yamile cardozo Get it from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in three styles and two colors). Read more about acupressure and nausea at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . Promising review: ""So glad I bought these. Flying usually makes me terribly nauseous. These helped so much! You need to find the right pressure point, and they are really tight. Other than that, 5 stars."" — T. Schneider Get a set of two from Amazon for $12.50+ (available in adult and children's sizes and six colors). Check them out on TikTok here . BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord swears by these and raves: ""The moldable silicone of Mack's Earplugs contours easily to the shape of your ear to block out noise much more effectively than other foam or plastic varieties, and the noise reduction is so good that if I pair them with a white noise machine (or just like a white noise loop on Spotify) I genuinely don't hear noises from outside my room. I've also *loved* these for traveling — if you put these babies in on a plane not only does it help reduce some of the YIKES factor when the plane takes off (it's loud!!), but it cancels out the murmuring noises of passengers on the flight and makes it easier to get some shuteye. "" Promising review: ""I've been purchasing Mack's earplugs for about eight years now as they help me sleep so much better at night (and are also super helpful on long plane trips). They're the best ones on the market and much larger with more comfort and coverage than ones in my local stores and pharmacies. Mack's are getting harder to find so I'm writing this in the hope that they stay in business."" — Amazon Customer Get 12 pairs from Amazon for $12.99 . EverSnug is a small biz specializing in travel pillow/blankets. Check it out on TikTok . Promising review: ""I have never missed taking this blanket on a trip and it has saved me from cold planes to hotels. It's soft, comfortable, and convenient. Easy to clean. Buying more!"" — Hayley Get it from Amazon for $29.95 (available in seven colors). Read more about compression socks for travel at Johns Hopkins and The Huffington Post . Promising review: ""These compression socks really helped me. No swelling of feet and legs on a flight from New York to Munich and onto Palermo. Amazing fit and not too thick. Really comfortable."" — L. M. Morabito Get them from Amazon for $14.24+ (available in unisex sizes S–XXL and in 13 colors). And check out our full Physix Gear compression socks review here. Promising review: ""Don't be fooled by the tiny price or size, this little baby is serious. If you are looking for a small travel option rather than lugging your big straightener and giant curling iron around the world, than I think you'll love this. It performs really well, turning my frizzy wavy hair into a smooth and sleek style. The curling iron option also creates shiny, silky lasting curls! It's easy to transition between both. I also like the grippy handle and the fact that the curling iron clip is a different color than the straightening bars because that helps me see how I should be maneuvering it around. The voltage goes up to 240m, so you are good using it internationally without a converter (but you will need an adapter just to fit it into various foreign outlets). At this price, definitely give it a try and flaunt your tresses abroad."" — Christine Get it from Amazon for $49.99+ (available in two colors). See it in action on TikTok . This has three USB ports, 1 USB-C, and can charge up to six devices at once! Promising review: ""Prior to this purchase, we've killed an appliance or two in overseas travel. We bought this for a trip to the Philippines. It worked like a champ! We charged our iPhones and other high-end devices with peace of mind. My wife used her flat iron with this just fine. I like that it has plug adapters for outlets around the world, so I know wherever we go, we can use this. I recommend this to anyone doing international travel."" — David Aiken Get it from Amazon for $39.98 (available in two styles). Promising review: "" This is my new favorite travel gadget! Super compact and sleek, so far no issues with charging my iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods, and performance remains consistent. This charger has eliminated at least two additional cords, and I deeply appreciate not having to shuffle chargers around when packing for travel. The charging light has an on/off feature by the watch pad, so I’m able to keep it on the bedside table at night without a bright green light shining in my face. It’s also hard to overlook when packing back up to leave a hotel, which might be the second most important feature! Overall, a great value for the money and such a great tool for staying organized during travel."" — Cassandra Get it from Amazon for $29.99 . Promising review: ""I bought this wallet right before a business trip. I wanted something that was small, but still had room to carry necessities. This wallet did that and more. Besides my ID and credit cards, I carried my passport and organized my receipt s. It held a lot but didn’t take up much room in my purse. It was also cute to carry alone as a small clutch. I’m actually planning to buy more as gifts."" — Sherlethia Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in 29 colors). Promising review: "" I took my kids on their first international trip, and this thing was a total lifesaver. It fits easily in a fanny pack or small purse for easy access, and it fit my whole family's passports, vaccine cards, boarding passes, and a pen with plenty of room for cash and cards if you decide to use it as a wallet for your trip. It made getting checked in a breeze and helped my family keep everything organized."" — Kevin Garcia Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in five colors). Promising review: ""This cup holder is perfect! It helps me a lot! Last time I took a plane with a suitcase and a cup of coffee, when it’s my turn to check my passport and ticket, the coffee cup fell to the ground and coffee sprinkled. It was a nightmare! This time I bought this cup holder, it did do me a favor! I don't have to worry about where my cup and phone are! I can free my hands to do other things. I love it so much! Hope you love it too."" — Philip Get it from Amazon for $11.99+ (available in 19 colors). This travel stroller is super customizable — you can mix and match the metal of the stroller as well as the color, so you can choose the perfect combination for you. I love this stroller with every fiber of my being . Now, there may be other travel strollers that are cheaper out there — but believe me, none as comfy and as luxurious as this . Driving this around the airport when I went to NYC, I'm not gonna lie, I almost felt too fancy. My daughter was comfy in the stroller the entire time (and I'm the type of traveler that's there at least a solid three hours early), which is actually super impressive considering she's currently in the ""fight for freedom all day, every day"" stage. Traveling with a baby is hard, and if this is your first, you're definitely gonna realize pretty darn quickly how difficult it is to travel when compared to your pre-baby life. This stroller has made it so easy for me. I don't have to worry about the airline sending my checked-in stroller to the baggage claim (thus forcing me to carry a heavy baby for like half an hour), nor do I have to worry about it getting damaged when tossed with other luggage. This easily folds, has a carrying handle built in so I don't have to worry about bringing a separate carrying case, and is super easy to open up when it's time to exit the flight . I can't state enough how much I love this. Get it from Cybex for $599.95 (available in a variety of colors and customizations). Liuliuby is a New York-based small business that specializes in stroller and car seat accessories. Promising review: ""This thing was amazing! I give it 10 stars — it fit every type of chair we encountered on our Kenyan vacation! Kept our toddler controlled and made feeding on the go so easy. Very lightweight and packable, a vacation must-have!"" — Kireme1 Get it from Amazon for $26.99 . Promising review: "" I recently traveled and had no problem with TSA. I like the moisturizer; you can just rub it in. If you have coarse hair, the blades may dull sooner than later. I preferred just to wet my leg and then spray the water. It seemed to get more of a lather for me. Super convenient!! "" — Western Pa mom/grandma Get it from Amazon for $20 (available in pink and blue). Promising review: ""I love that this product is an all-in-one! It saves me so much space when I travel, and the products are high-quality too. The lightest brow pencil is still a little dark for blondes like me, but the other shades complement me perfectly. I like the lip liner the best; it easily elevates a simple lip look!"" — Sam Get it from Amazon for $20 (available in three shades). Promising review : ""This product...I have no clue how this works, but it does! Let me start by saying I was wearing a full face of makeup . I mean foundation, contour highlight, eyeliner, seriously the whole nine yards. All I did was wet it and wiped my face, my jaw literally dropped. This is hands-down my favorite makeup remover. The best part is that they are reusable so you don't have to keep buying those expensive disposables that leave your face feeling greasy."" — Heather Griffith Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in six colors and in packs of three or six). Promising review: "" I will never fly again without this. I've recommended it to everyone. East Coast USA to Southeast Asia, 24 hours in long haul flights each way with serious low back pain condition to start. But being able to hang my legs, even in a sideways position, saved me from hours of pain that I have endured previously flying with economy leg room. It is easy to loop over tray table brackets in both the stowed and open positions. This is a must-have for any flight."" — DL Flin Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (also available in multipacks). When not in use, this can be folded down into an itsy-bitsy lil' pouch, is water and tear-resistant, and has a side pocket for shoes! Plus, it has a strap on the side, so you can easily slide it onto your luggage handle! Promising review: ""We bought this to take with us when we visited our daughter, who is studying abroad for four months. We figured she would not have enough room in her luggage when it was time to come home. Folded up, this bag was so compact and lightweight that it took up almost no room in our own luggage for the trip over. Then, sure enough, she had a ton of clothes and shoes to send home with us and packed this bag full. We checked the bag, and it made it through two international flights without a scratch. The BEST feature is the side strap that allows you to slide it over the handle of a rolling suitcase so you don't have to carry it. This is probably the most practical and the best-value item I have purchased in years. "" — Tosa Mom Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in 13 colors and patterns). There are also four other leather garment bags available in lighter colors (I personally am a fan of this pretty pink one ). Promising review: ""I love this bag! I bought it as my 5-year-old’s carry-on for our Disney vacation, and it was perfect — the perfect size for keeping her five princess dresses clean, relatively wrinkle-free, organized, and containing the glitter from the rest of her stuff! I tend to overpack, and I still had room left after packing five days' worth of her stuff!"" — daisy Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in seven colors/styles). Say hello to the outfit of the summer. I live in Florida, and although it's barely even summer, it's already incredibly hot. I've been wearing this outfit pretty much daily for the last month, and let me tell you, I've been getting compliments wherever I go. It's lightweight, it's airy, and it's perfect for those scorching temperatures. They're so easy to mix and match with other clothes, and it's bound to get some heads turning your way when you weave in and out of the streets of your summer destination. Get it from Banana Republic for $100 (available in women's sizes XXS—XXL, including tall and petite sizes, and nine colors).

We will be landing shortly. Thank you for your patience.' The whole plane cheered when we landed."" — u/darkest_irish_lass — u/DoorstepCult ""I started dipping in and out of the water because my arms and legs started getting tired, and I was treading for my son's life. Finally, I got the other snorkelers' attention and called for help, and a group of them came over. Someone with a paddleboard got my son, and then I floated and paddled as much as possible while a dude there pulled me toward a boat. I almost passed out from exhaustion when I got on the little boat. I legitimately thought both my son and I were goners. The thing is, we're both good swimmers. If he hadn't been panicking, he could have swum to shore, which wasn't far away, or expelled the water from his snorkel and continued swimming. And since he was pulling me down, I was panicking and not thinking straight enough to tell him what to do. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life."" — u/SweetCosmicPope — u/Guerilla555 — u/alizabs91 ""I told the person on the phone I was canceling, and the next thing I know, the driver in the car yelled at me through the window to get in. He even got out of the car at this point. My friend and I ran back into the hotel lobby. We explained the situation to the front desk, and thankfully, the staff jumped into action. We also reported it to Uber. I am grateful we were close enough to the hotel to run away. If we weren't, I don't know what would have happened."" — u/Moon2078 — u/Sleepy_Glacier ""The pre-smartphone days were rough; we had no idea what was happening. After being rescued by the Thai Coast Guard and getting back to the mainland 12-15 hours later, we found out that thousands of people had died. It was a shock. Overall, it was the scariest vacation moment I've had and the scariest day of my life."" — u/Azagsloth — u/PigeonFace — u/Rigar_ ""I was trying to catch up, but my finger started giving out. At one point, I was so far behind that I tried to go a little faster, and that's when my finger locked up and I slammed into a dune hill, causing the ATV to flip over on top of me. It wasn't a little one either, and my life literally flashed before me. It all happened so fast that all I remember was that I was pinned under, but my adrenaline must've kicked into high gear because I somehow managed to lift this 1,000-pound object off my back.

My husband was trying to come to my rescue, but was fighting the waves to get to me. My energy quickly depleted, and after the next wave, I only barely came up for air. That's when I realized that no one was going to be able to save me, and I was going to drown. At that moment, a voice told me to stop fighting the waves. My survival instinct told me otherwise, but the voice was calm and commanding. So I did, and within two giant waves, I had been brought close enough for my husband to grab my arm and pull me to shore. I sat quietly, shaking and blue, for a while as my husband cared for me. Needless to say, I avoided the beach pretty much the rest of our trip."" —Anonymous — u/jwangy84 — u/unsoldburrito — u/k_marts Note: Submissions have been edited for length and/or clarity.",2025-06-24T17:49:53.501125+00:00

A break from ultra-processed foods. Tasty Contributor In other words, your body knows when it’s being fed chemical soup, and it’s not happy about it. So yes, our food might be slowly killing us. But, hey, at least it’s convenient, right? — Read ingredient lists. If it has 32 ingredients and you can’t pronounce half of them, maybe skip it. — Prioritize organic when possible. Yes, it’s more expensive. But when you can, do it. Especially for produce and animal products. — Look for “banned in Europe” ingredients. If it’s banned over there and allowed here, consider it a red flag (not a sexy red flag either). — Cook more at home. Even just a couple of meals a week can help cut down on additives. — Follow the 80/20 rule. You don’t have to eat clean all the time; just try to make it your default. And maybe, just maybe, we start holding food manufacturers and government regulators accountable: lobby for better labeling, ask questions, and vote with your fork.

De-tangles and smoothes wonderfully. Even tamed my static-y hair. Love it!"" — Crazy cat mama Get it from Amazon for $19.95 (also available in white). Promising review : ""Discreet yet spacious. I purchased this for a recent trip. I was able to fit my phone, passport, credit cards, and cash in it easily and it wasn’t bulky or obvious under my clothing . It was comfortable to wear for extended periods of time."" — KailensMom Get it from Amazon for $12.76 (available in 20 styles and two sizes). Promising review: ""I carried this pouch during a three-week cruise through Greece and Turkey. It was extremely comfortable, lightweight, and handy, allowing easy access to important papers and money. Love it!"" — JC Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in five colors). You can also switch between pound and kilogram measurements. I tested this digital luggage scale out when packing for a trip to Iceland — check out my demo of how it works on TikTok! Promising review: ""We used this on a six-flight trip across Europe and it made it easy to know that we repacked our bags according to the various weight limits. Some bags had a 10-kg limit and some had a 50-lb limit so it was convenient to switch back and forth between units (even though dividing by 2.2 isn't exactly rocket science)."" — Robert Get it from Amazon for $9.39+ (available in four colors and a two-pack). Cadence is an AAPI woman-owned small business that was founded by Steph Hon as a way to eliminate single-use travel-sized plastics. The containers are made from recycled ocean-bound plastic. But I'm not the only fan on the BuzzFeed Shopping team. My coworker Abby Kass has these and loves them! Here's what she has to say about them: ""I recently got a set of four of these, and, wow, I love them so much. I used them on a six-day trip recently, and they were perfect. I customized the label so I knew which one was my shampoo vs. conditioner and did a general label for any other things I wanted to bring along. They do hold a surprising amount. According to the brand, they hold approximately one to two weeks of skincare products, more than two weeks' worth of serum, two to three days' worth of haircare, and more than 15 tablets (for medicine and such). And while two to three days' worth of haircare might not seem like enough, I found it held more than that for me, but I also don't wash my hair every single day. They were small enough to slip right into my toiletries bag and go through TSA with no problem. The container was easy to open in the shower (even with wet hands), and I had no leakage from them (like I did from my face wash bottle that will not be making the trip with me next time, SMH). These are an incredibly useful tool anyone who travels will want in their luggage."" Promising review: ""I absolutely love these! I ended up buying more of the labels and extra containers on the website. These are perfect for a first-time set and the perfect size for flying. 100% makes my packing lighter and more contained overall."" — Sara Get a set of three from Amazon for $42 (available in six colors and in a haircare and daily routine set ). I own and love this set! it includes the zippered bag, four soft silicone bottles with leakproof caps, three compact jars, an two toothbrush caps. I've used this set on more than five trips and and for trips when I don't require body wash or shampoo (like to visit my parents) I use the extra room in the bag to shove in all my beauty products and daily contacts. Plus! It comes with labels that stay on the containers really well despite my thoroughly washing these containers between trips. I bought this set in spring 2019 and have, admittedly, lost a container or two. But the ones that I've held onto over dozens of trips have all held up well! Promising review: ""If it wasn’t for me forgetting them in the hotels, I wouldn’t have to buy more. This is my third set and I love these things! I’m a flight attendant and these are easy to fill, use, and pack!"" — Raena Hill Get it from Amazon for $5.99 .

JetBag is a small business specializing in creating bags to protect your wine and your stuff. It's designed with absorbent padding on the inside, so in the event that the bottle breaks, it won't get everywhere in your luggage.

All three made it on the Eurostar and two flights in perfect condition."" — Katie Get a set of three from Amazon for $13.99 (available in four colors). Promising review: ""I love this foldable airplane blanket! There are few things worse on a flight than being too cold. This little blanket is the perfect weight to keep you warm but doesn’t take up too much room in your carry-on/personal item bag. I actually clip it to the outside of my backpack."" — Danielle Gaudette Get it from Amazon for $25.03 (available in 16 colors). Ciera Velarde , a former editor here at BuzzFeed, also loves this! She says: ""I've used this for the past few years and swear by it! Before this, I always found traditional neck pillows uncomfortable and would end up ditching them halfway through the flight and getting frustrated. The Trtl pillow is adjustable — you wrap the pillow around your neck and secure it with Velcro, and if you find it's too loose, just make it a bit tighter! I've truly never slept better on a plane than with this pillow. "" Promising review: ""I love this TRTL!! I first used it on a trip from Seattle to Buenos Aires and will now always use it. It made it possible for me to be comfortable on that long flight. I found it to be the best neck support in how it holds up my neck in a comfortable natural way. I love how I can use it on either side of my neck, and even in the front and back of my neck. I love how I can cover my face to just below my eyes if I want privacy. It is cozy, lightweight, durable and packs easily, or I can wrap it around my carry bag handle for quick transport. I bought one for a friend who took it on a Seattle to New York flight and she said it was a game changer for her as she was able to sleep for the first time while flying. Now I know that with my TRTL and Bose noise cancelling head phones, I can be cramped in a middle seat on a long flight and survive in relative comfort. Thank your TRTL!!! I just bought another one for a gift for my daughter. It is a well-designed product!"" — Amis Balcomb Get it from Amazon for $60.99 + (available in five colors). RNOONY is a small biz.

I think the table and bench covers are well made for the price I paid."" — Maria Get it from Amazon for $34.99 (available in eight patterns). Beauty Goodies is a small business that specializes in chic storage and travel accessories. Promising review: ""This garment bag is an exceptional value for the money. Well built, top quality materials, including 'beefy' zippers, should hold up well for airline travel. Minimal wrinkles if any in garments, and a cavernous bag for storing shoes and other items for a trip. Added bonus, it fits easily in the plane overhead storage, similar in size to a standard roller bag . I highly recommend this product."" — Kindle Customer Get it from Amazon for $57.45 (available in three colors). Promising review: ""Love this! I am a flight attendant and keep it in my suitcase for various uses, but it's an outstanding for beach or picnic blanket. It weighs nothing, beautiful, and great quality! My new go-to gift item."" — Laurance F. Haun Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in 21 patterns). Promising review: ""FLIGHT ATTENDANT APPROVED! They work. 100% of the time."" — Jessica Get a set of two from Amazon for $8.47 . Just make sure that if you pack in your carryon, it's easily accessible because I've had TSA pull me aside a few times to see what it is. Promising review: ""My best guy friend bought this for me and I love it. I’m a flight attendant and am in hotels 4-5 nights a week. Sometimes the “locks” just don’t feel sturdy enough. This device gives me an extra layer of security and allows me to sleep at night. I keep it in my flight bag."" — Emilia Duren Get it from Amazon for $11.99 (also available in packs of two and four). Check out a TikTok of the towel clips in action. Promising review: ""I purchased these for a family of eight going on a cruise and they loved them! So easy to use, just put your towel on the beach chair and clip down with these. They said they were especially awesome on windy days when others towels were blowing away if they were not sitting on the chair. The family was able to go to lunch or take a walk and not worry that their towels had been blown away and someone had then snagged their seats. Very inexpensive and functional clips."" — TypeA Get a set of 16 from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""Guys. If you’re going on a trip and need a cute hat but don’t want to worry about it getting smashed…look no further. I bought this hat last summer. It’s been as far as The Maldives, all over Europe, and I wear it on the reg in southern California. It’s totally kept its shape, and I’m not shy of shoving it in bags. 10/10 recommend! I’m sitting on a bus in Croatia right now thinking how awesome this hat has been and decided to write a review, as I rely on reviews for my purchases on Amazon. Hope this helps someone!"" — Lyra S. Get it from Amazon for $24.99+ (available in 21 color combos). It has RFID-blocking technology; is made of slash-resistant, Securtex anti-theft fabric; and locking zippers that blend in with the backpack's design. Promising review: ""This has great security features. The compartment that holds cards has a locking zipper and sits securely against your back. Two side pockets for water bottle, umbrella, etc. Very roomy and lightweight. I used it this weekend at a tulip festival in Washington. It lightly rained the whole time I was outdoors, and nothing in my bag got wet. It wiped dry easily. A great daypack for adventures!"" — pixie Get it from Amazon for $108.59 (available in 10 colors). Promising review: ""My husband and I travel a lot and take a number of prescription drugs. It was always a hassle accessing our medication when needed, so I purchased this organizer to make things easier. I used a label maker and labeled each little compartment and it has performed wonderfully. I highly recommend this organizer to anyone who travels and needs medications throughout the day."" — Jacqueline Get a three-pack from Amazon for $9.97 . Promising review: ""When you go to the pool or beach nowadays you see a lot of people with these $100+ rubber carry-alls. Sure, they look nice, but they are not as practical as this bag or have the features of this bag. I came to appreciate this bag when I loaded up the grandkids to take to the pool and realized too late that I did not remove my hearing aids or empty my pockets. This bag comes with a nice waterproof pouch and I was able to keep all those belongings, I should have left at home, safe and dry all day!"" — David Petraitis Get it from Amazon for $23.99 (available in 10 colors/prints). Promising review: ""This is my first time buying a 'fancier' suitcase, and I love it so far! I took it with me on a trip to NYC for work and used it as a carry-on. I was easily able to lift it up, and it fit very well in the overhead bins. A lot of people were asked to gate check, but as this bag met the requirements, I was able to bring it on all my American Airlines flights. I love the inside design with the different pockets and that my packing cubes easily fit. I had enough clothes and work items for four days and could easily have fit more, at least for a week! Also, it comes with a laundry bag, as I had forgotten mine. I highly recommend it. I think it will last me for a long time!"" — Marie C. Get it from Amazon for $199.95 (available in two colors). Now you won't even have to pull your suitcase outta the overhead! Promising review : ""This works out so well for me. I’m a flight attendant, and I’ve had an infinite amount of day trips over the summer. I got tired of carrying around my regular TravelPro spinner, so I finally ordered this. SOOOOO MUCH BETTER FOR ME. It’s light, has enough pockets, and can easily fit under a seat if needed. The ONLY picky thing I can think of is how loud it sounds going across rough concrete. The wheels aren’t as silent as others, but that won’t stop me from buying another in the future."" — Kayla T Get it from Amazon for $50.88+ (available in four colors). Promising review : ""Purchased three pairs for our cruise. We all loved them. Best water shoes I’ve ever worn. Feels like you are barefoot but keeps your feet safe from anything you step on. Very comfortable! Highly recommended!"" — Donna M Get it from Amazon for $8.68+ (available in seven sizes and 44 colors). I wear a size L/XL in clothing and sometimes waist bags just don't work out so well for me. With this one, I can confirm that it fit around my waist comfortably without outerwear, across my chest without outerwear, *and* over a thick coat and several layers. The pockets inside are so handy and I even had room to spare throughout my Iceland trip. This was the only purse I brought for the whole trip and it performed its job flawlessly. Just make sure that you zip the zipper ALL the way because the zipper goes down pretty far on the sides for easier access to contents. Having my hands free was wildly convenient for a number of reasons, including crawling around inside of an ice cave and putting out my hands for some extra balance while walking on sheets of ice along cliffs. Oh, and it comes in so so SO many colors. And in case it looks familiar, TikTokers compare it to the Lulu waist bag. Promising review : ""Love this little bag! And the price — you can’t beat it."" — Jolie Get it from Amazon for $15.98+ (available in 42 styles). Promising reviews: ""This jumpsuit is cute and comfortable. I love it. It is very comfortable to wear on a road trip or for flying."" — B-More Mom & Luvin' It Get it from Amazon for $28.78+ (available in sizes S–3X and 32 colors/patterns). Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines. Promising review: ""I love that this travel toothbrush has its own self closing cover. Makes it very handy for travel at half the size of a regular toothbrush when packed and full size brush when open . Also really love the bristles on this brush, they are soft but have enough stiffness to get between teeth when brushing."" — Yvonne Get it from Amazon for $5.99 (available in two colors). SlumberPod is a small biz that's been featured on Shark Tank ! Promising review: ""We took a 10-day road trip stopping in all different locations with my 18-month-old. Such an game changer! No stress at all as to where or how he would nap! He slept great everywhere and I didn’t have to do my usual blackout shade where I’m trying to make shades on the fly everywhere we went like we had to do with my other two when they were little. Do a test run setting it up before you travel. It’s not terribly hard but the first attempt needs some extra time. The tent runs warm so make sure your child is wearing light breathable clothes is the room is 68 or above. My son wore just a short sleeve onesie and a light sleep sack and was still warm with the room temp 68. I cracked the window to make it a lot cooler in the room he slept in since we didn’t do the whole fan attachment thing."" — jillyb Get it from Amazon for $179.99 . Cliganic is a small biz specializing in health and wellness products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I bought this to take on a cruise. Never had issues with bites. Once back home I put them on my son who is allergic to some bites and always itchy after time outdoors. Since he’s had these on outside it’s hardly an issue anymore. Very cool."" — MardiGrasGirl Get a 10-pack from Amazon for $8.49 . After putting this in MANY travel stories, I bought one for myself for a summer European vacation where I found myself at several beach clubs. It was perfect for keeping mine and my friend's belongings safe while we dozed in our beach chairs or swam in the sea. Plus, it's the perfect size to hold phones or wallets, and easily carry in your beach or tote bag. It's come in clutch in a few hotels and Airbnbs that didn't have working safes. Promising review: ""Loveeeee this safe! Took it on a cruise, and it was such a great feeling of security. I put all my cash and docs in it while around and off the ship in the larger room safe. In my case, I had a roommate I did not know prior to sailing. With this, I didn’t have to worry about a thing. Easy to lock and unlock. Easy to secure around things. I just love it! I will be using it with other things at home/work as well."" — Cara Sievers Get it from Amazon for $23.99+ (available in three colors). Promising review: ""We bought this for a road trip with our little one, who is still rear facing — it was perfect! We knew the seat was warm from just driving around town and wanted to make sure it was comfortable for a long drive. It kept it cool, isn’t loud, and love that we could plug it in vs. only the battery. We use it regularly in town now, too."" — K Maddock Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in four colors). My former colleague Ciera Velarde is a huge fan! (As am I!) Here's what she has to say: ""I've used it for about 12 years now and it's the only thing that I can trust to prevent that dreaded chafing after a sweaty day of walking around. It glides on perfectly, it's unscented, and it doesn't melt away when you start to sweat. If it's a particularly hot day out, it can start to fade after a few hours, so just make sure to bring it with you to reapply. In addition to preventing chafing between my thighs, I've also applied it on my arms where my sports bra rubs against them when I run and it works like a charm!"" Promising review: ""Used this on our cruise, for all the walking in hot, humid places. Literally saved my thighs from 'chub rub.'"" — Traci Carpenter Get it from Amazon for $6 . Check out a TikTok of the drink holder in action. Promising review : ""I bought this to use on a cruise. I had such an easy time carrying my drinks around. So many people asked where I purchased it from."" — Jasmine Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in multipacks). Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it . No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" — Angela Leonard ""Two drops in your eyes and all day, they look perfectly white and healthy. I would definitely buy these again."" — Kelley Get it from Amazon for $11.37 . Promising review: ""Prefect for international travel! Easy to use and protected against theft/pickpockets. Used it on my recent trip to Europe!"" — Rachel Bristol Get a four-pack from Amazon for $12.99 (available in four color combos). Arden Cove is a woman-owned brand founded by sisters Carmen and Karin Yuen after carrying disappointing bags and gear while globetrotting. It has a waterproof body and zipper, slash-proof lining all around, locking zippers, RFID blocking material, a chain shoulder that strap attaches to a post or chair, built-in wallet, shoulder pad on strap for added comfort, bottom studs to protect it from wear and tear when setting the bag down, and an interior D-ring to attach a keychain. Promising review: ""I have been using this bag as my ONLY purse for a full year now. I travel full time, and my #1 priority is to keep my belongings and my information safe, so this purse is a game changer for me. I love the cut-proof chain, the slash-proof material, it's waterproof and it keeps RFID readers from stealing my credit card info. I get compliments on it all the time as I wear it through Europe, Asia, Canada, and the States! LOVE my Arden Cove!"" — Kashlee Parmiter Get it from Amazon for $179 (available in five colors and three chain drop lengths). Promising review : ""Great idea, handy little gadget. A tiny bit bulkier than I wanted to pack, but so very glad I did! Took with me for a flight out of the country. Handy to be able to clamp or stand on tray table to watch films aired via in-flight Wi-Fi. Sturdy, versatile, appears well made, and durable. Used with Samsung Galaxy Note 10+."" — KLMCats Get it from Amazon for $9.99 . My colleague Chelsea Stuart owns and loves this: ""I splurged on some AirPod Maxes and for the amount of money I threw down on them, I was determined to get as much use out of them as possible and that included on plane rides. With the AirFly Pro, I can connect my headphones via Bluetooth and use the seat-back screen without having to fiddle with the free wired headphones they hand out that 1.) have horrible sound quality and 2.) don't fit my ears in the slightest (I swear my ear canals are tiny or something??)."" It also comes with a USB-C charging cable, travel pouch, keychain holder, quick-start guide, and a manual. Twelve South is a small business that has been creating innovative tech accessories since 2009. Promising review: ""I was a little reluctant purchasing Airfly after reading the reviews, but I’m so glad I did! It worked perfectly on the plane, and while on my trip, I also used it to listen to music in the car. It acted like a speaker because I had no aux cable. It was great!"" — Yamile cardozo Get it from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in six styles and three colors). Storytime: I finally bought a couple of Apple AirTags during 2022 Black Friday sales. And I am SO grateful I did. My normal carry-on bag was too big to fit the Lufthansa luggage requirements (and BOY, do they check that!) so I had to check my bags for a December 2022 trip to Vienna and back from Prague (with a layover in Frankfurt). My bag didn't make it onto the plane in Frankfurt, and once I landed in Newark, New Jersey, I pulled up the app on my phone and saw that yes, my backpack AirTag was indeed with me, but my suitcase AirTag was still in Germany . (The screen grab is from an Amazon review, but you get the gist.) The AirTag also helped me track FedEx's delivery of the suitcase to my parents' house, where I was spending the holidays immediately after my Europe trip ended. I was even able to see it on a highway less than an hour's drive from my parents' house. TL;DR: I think AirTags are very much a worthwhile investment if you travel a few times a year. And I'm not the only one who thinks so. Promising review: ""I bought a pair of these AirTags for a trip to France, and I’m so glad I did! First of all, the setup is super easy. I had zero problems, and both were done in, like, five minutes. I put one in my purse and one in my suitcase. On the way back home, the airline lost my luggage. Checked the Find My Friends app where the AirTag is tracked, and I could see that it never left the Charles de Gaulle airport. I felt more assurance being able to track my bag through the app as it made its way across the world back to me. 10/10 would recommend!"" — Lindsay Kirby Get it from Amazon for $24 . Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" — Teresa Get it from Amazon for $16+ (available in six colors/styles). Promising reviews: ""This was such a life saver while traveling in Europe. It is small enough to keep in your purse or fanny pack but powerful enough to keep your phone charged and working through navigating new cities, paying for tube/metro rides and translating menus into the language you understand. I highly recommend this product and have started to carry it around in my purse as a back up."" — Jen West Get it from Amazon for $14.99 . Waypoint Goods is a small biz that specializes in travel accessories. Promising review: ""I absolutely LOVE my travel scarf. This piece is perfect for every occasion. Whether I am traveling on a plane or a road trip, at work, or trying to dress up an outfit to go out, it is perfect and functional. My phone, credit cards and keys fit seamlessly in the pocket without changing the look or fit of my scarf. At times I have put all of that plus a boarding pass and passport in the pocket!!"" — Caroline Get it from Amazon for $49.95 (available in three styles). And they come with a hand pump for travel! Psst, get even more efficient and pack an empty one of these in your suitcase just in case. Promising review : ""This is a great product. I have a memory foam pillow that I try to take on trips, due to neck issues, so I purchased this product and put it to the test to see if it could flatten the pillow so I can also carry my clothes and the pillow in the same bag, carry-on size travel bag. The pillow's been sitting in the vacuum pack for the last three days now and hasn't let any air into the package at all. The pump removed so much air that the foam is as solid as a rock with less that an 1/8 of an inch of give when I press on it firmly with my thumb."" — 4-H Shooting Sports Instructor Get a pack of five from Amazon for $22.99 + (also available in a ten-pack and in five bag sizes). Promising review: ""What an adorable and efficient way to pack your jewelry! I have been hesitant even to bring jewelry on my last few vacations because it always got tangled. Love this! Bought one for my sister-in-law as well."" — Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in two sizes and eight colors/prints). Promising review: ""Used these on a sunburn on my back, and they were very soothing. Also provided padding when leaning back in my seat. I stuck one on my shoulder also to keep my seatbelt from rubbing the sunburn there. I bought them to use on the back of my kids' necks to help prevent heat exhaustion on a very hot day outside but ended up just using them for burn relief."" — Joanna ""These saved us on our vacation with our little that is sensitive to sun!"" — felicia faith Get a pack of 20 from Amazon for $14.99 . Promising review: ""My kids need the room to be pretty dark to sleep. I didn’t have much faith in this, but needed to try something. These are AMAZING!! Absolutely worth every penny. Instantly darker and help keep the room at a comfortable temperature."" — Julie T Get it from Amazon for $31.76 (available in five designs). This is a product that I put in travel stories over and over and over again, and would always think, ""Hmm, I should buy some."" Once I booked my first-ever cruise (with Virgin Voyages , which was fantastic, btw), I knew that I needed to invest in these hangers to make the most of what I presumed would be a tiny closet for my cabin. These were super easy to slip into my super-packed suitcase and plenty sturdy for holding up a variety of stuff. In my pic above, you'll see one collapsed and then one in use, with dips perfect for spaghetti or thin straps. So many hotel and rental places' hangers don't have those little dips, and my slip dresses (I own four of this one!) are always slipping off of them. With these, I was able to put a variety of garments on them without anything slipping off — in fact, they work better at that than my regular velvet hangers I have at home! Get a 12-pack from Amazon for $9.99 . Promising review: ""As an international flight attendant, I am in different countries weekly. While the all-in-one adapters, in theory, are great, they often are too big/heavy to stay in the socket securely — you are much better off with one like this. It is sturdy in the socket, even with an electric cord (my hair curler) and my phone and iPad all plugged in. Very satisfied!"" — Susan H. Get it from Amazon for $17.99 . Promising review: ""Definitely what I needed for my luggage as a flight attendant. Very heavy duty and perfect for me. Works great with my extra luggage and lunch bag to hang on my suitcase. Thank you so much. Will definitely buy again."" — Mary Get it from Amazon for $8.49+ (available in five colors and in multipacks). The wallet has a passport pocket, boarding pass compartment, three credit card slots, an ID slot, a slim card pouch, slim pocket, a ticket slot, a cellphone pouch, a coin zippered pocket, key holder, and pen holder. Promising review: ""OMG I totally love this! First of all, it’s such a pretty pastel pink color and pink is my favorite color. The quality is also so lovely with all the right amount of pockets to store my IDs and passport and other relevant documents. I’m a flight attendant so this is the perfect size of travel wallet for me. This definitely exceeded my expectations!"" — Pravena Jay Get it from Amazon for $13.99+ (available in 28 colors). Rinseroo is a small business specializing in problem-solving cleaning, pet, and travel products. Promising review : ""I used these on my travel toiletries on a month-long road trip. On several occasions, the toiletry lids opened, but none of the product leaked out of the toiletry skins. I was even able to pour the leaked shampoo back into the bottle. I rinsed out the skin and placed it back on for the next leg of my journey. These are my new travel must-haves."" — Tyson Mohr Get a four-pack from Amazon for $11.99 (also available in an eight-pack). Promising review: ""I am a flight attendant and I LOVE this organizer! I keep my iPad, passport, cords, paperwork, and hand sanitizer in here. It keeps me organized! Definitely recommend to anyone who travels and needs to keep organized."" — amazonislife Get it from Amazon for $17.99+ (available in four colors and two sizes). Promising review: ""I am a flight attendant and have a wacky work schedule. I frequently have to sleep during the day. These are SO comfortable and cool as well. I have ordered and tried out at least 10 eye-masks off of Amazon and have found these to be the best. They are SO comfortable and do not have velcro on the straps, for which I am thankful, because I usually sleep on my back and am sensitive to the thickness of eyemasks which have the Velcro straps."" — SW Get one from Amazon for $14.99 . Promising review: ""Bought this bag last minute for a uniform compliance as a flight attendant, and it’s sturdy and a great bag. For the material and the price, it’s a great purchase. I’ve had it over four months."" — Amber Get it from Amazon for $14.29+ (available in a variety of colors and two sizes). It also comes with a heat-resistant pouch for easy carrying! Promising review: ""This fits perfectly in my toiletries travel bag that I take with me as a flight attendant. Anything that comes in a small size and still works well is perfect for me."" — Kathy S Get it from Amazon for $16.99+ (available in three colors). These come with a wireless charging case that provides up to 14 hours of charge (with the earbuds able to play for four-plus hours with each full charge). I also use these on the reg in my everyday life to listen to Spotify and podcasts, and even talk on the phone. I have to charge them about once a week and always keep them in my coat pocket. Promising review: ""I am a flight attendant and use this headset so much. Using FaceTime, making phone calls, listening to music, or watching a movie."" — Ruben Mercado Get it from Amazon $18.99+ (available in five colors and two styles). Promising review : ""I’m a flight attendant and I love this one! I love the Velcro 'quick detachment.' It’s the best! I had one before without the Velcro opening that just stretched over the handle and it was a PAIN! This one is great! There’s room for two large drinks and a slim pocket for my phone or wallet. Many people see it and ask where I got my clever little caddy!"" — Debra G Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in various and patterns). File this as another item that I've included in what feels like a million travel stories and finally tried out for myself. I always thought, ""Why bother with a razor that's not THAT much smaller than a regular one?"" I think a cruise is the best use case for this. It bought a LITTLE more space in my personal item backpack (my beloved Beis !) and bought me a LOT more space on my shower shelf. Get it from Amazon for $12.19 (includes a refill). Check out a TikTok of the Airplane Pockets tray table cover in action. Airplane Pockets is a small business that specializes in sanitary, portable travel organization products. My colleague Emma Lord owns and loves this: ""I used this on a roundtrip from NYC to Tokyo, both with connecting flights in Canada, and cannot sing its praises enough. It fit all four of the different tray tables I used it on and was so ridiculously handy for keeping track of all my littler odds and ends like AirPods, the plane's headphones, earplugs, a sleep mask, a book, gum, a scrunchie, and little snacks. The hanging end of it easily tucked into the built-in sleeve of the seat in front of me for takeoff and when other passengers needed to scoot past me in my aisle seat. Usually, I feel like a hot mess and get frustrated rooting around in the grimy sleeve for my stuff, and this was such a refreshing solution! Several flight attendants even asked where I got it to buy one for themselves!"" Promising review: ""Very useful, especially when traveling with kids . Provided easy access and storage to things like water bottles, hand sanitizer, snacks, wipes, and headphones. I didn't have to access my carry-on."" — JJ Get it from Amazon for $24.99 . Promising review: ""Got these for a family cross-country road trip. Glad we did! Worked great for the kids at questionable stops. It says not to flush them. We had to once because of a kid with stomach pains and that was our only option…. Yea. Otherwise, avoid flushing. But they worked as advertised. Well, except the tape part, we didn’t realize until after our trip that they could stick to the seat, so apparently they work well even without doing that part."" — AmazonFrequentFlyer Get a pack of 24 covers from Amazon for $9.99 . Psst — it's also gluten-free, soy-free, and dairy-free! Promising review: ""This stuff seriously works. Took on a five-day cruise when we had the unlimited drink package, and these Liquid I.V.s saved my life several times. Wouldn’t have made it to dinner/gotten off the ship the next morning without them."" — Laura Bales Get a pack of 16 from Amazon for $23.45 (also available in sugar-free flavors ). I'm also quite partial to the newer grapefruit flavor. Reviews have been edited for length and/or clarity. ",2025-06-24T17:49:56.113115+00:00
